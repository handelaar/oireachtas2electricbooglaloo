      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. <i>a</i>11 &mdash; Motion re: Leave to Introduce Supplementary Estimates [Votes 3 and 32] and, subject to the agreement of No. <i>a</i>11, to take Supplementary Estimate [Vote 3]; No. <i>b</i>11 &mdash; Motion re: Referral of Supplementary Estimate [Vote 32] to Select Committee; No. <i>c</i>11 &mdash; Motion re: Double Taxation Convention between Ireland and Mexico; No. <i>d</i>11 &mdash; Motion re: Double Taxation Convention between Ireland and Estonia; No. <i>e</i>11 &mdash; Motion re: Double Taxation Convention between Ireland and Malaysia; No. <i>f</i>11 &mdash; Motion re: Double Taxation Convention between Ireland and the United Kingdom; No. 30 &mdash; Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance [1998] (resumed).</P>

      <P>There are two proposals to be put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. <i>a</i>11 and <i>b</i>11 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. <i>c</i>11, <i>d</i>11, <i>e</i>11 and <i>f</i>11 agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. <i>f</i>11 is a double taxation agreement with the United Kingdom which I presume must also be approved by the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  Will the Taoiseach convey to the British Parliament through the appropriate channels the view of the parties in this House that the suggestion that a new link should be created between the non-release of prisoners and the decommissioning of weapons is <Col N="294" /> unhelpful?  There is no such link in the British-Irish Agreement and the release of prisoners as planned in the Agreement should not be interfered with at this stage.</P>
      <P>This is the view of parties in the House which are extremely resolute and have been at times extremely sceptical about the intentions of the republican movement.  However, in this instance not to release prisoners before Christmas because decommissioning has not taken place would be very unhelpful.  The House of Commons should pause before it passes a motion to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case, but this is the only way I can ensure this matter is in order.  It is in order to decide whether we should deal with this matter without debate while considering other business.  I have no wish to obstruct this business, but it would helpful if the Taoiseach could respond to the opinion I expressed which is shared by all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the proposal. I am merely using it as a procedural device to raise this matter.  It is in order on this business, but it would not be in order on the Order of Business because no other legislative provision is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I again raise the point that the House should express its view that a link under which prisoner releases are stopped because decommissioning has not started was not provided for in the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that he has tabled a question to the Taoiseach for Question Time today.  He is anticipating that question.  However, I will allow the Taoiseach to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was yesterday.</P>

    <Col N="295" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further question. However, if the Deputy thinks it is sufficiently narrow, I will allow the Taoiseach to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion in Westminster today may have moved on to a point where people have stated their positions by the time I take those questions this afternoon.  Therefore, it may be helpful to comment now.</P>
      <P>It is clear in the British-Irish Agreement that there are no links on the issue of decommissioning. There are no preconditions and this has always been the case.  The position is clear regarding the release of prisoners and the legislation relating to the Convention on the Transfer of Prisoners.  These matters were discussed and a clear understanding was reached.  On Holy Thursday a large part of the discussion related to the release of prisoners and what would happen if the Agreement was signed by everybody.</P>
      <P>To cease releasing prisoners at this stage because of the issue of decommissioning would be to break the spirit and letter of the Agreement. Deputy Bruton's comments in that regard are correct.  It has been the Government's consistent view in its discussions and those with the British Government that the release of prisoners within the terms of the Agreement should continue. The issue of short-term releases over the Christmas period will also arise in the run up to Christmas.  If a blockage was created, it would cause more grave difficulties which we do not want.  It would be also against the work of the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, in recent weeks.  It is the Government's view that this matter should be left stand because there is no need to change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 December I asked the Taoiseach if he would consider briefing the leaders of the Opposition parties on developments in relation to Northern Ireland and he undertook to do so.  I am now asking that he move on that undertaking and if, at the Whips' meeting tonight, Government time will be made available to discuss Northern Ireland, bearing in mind the comments made here yesterday and the comments which the Taoiseach is reported to have made last night.  This House has a particular interest in the entire operation of the Agreement and has a specific responsibility for certain legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is continuing with a statement.  He should confine himself to a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that time be given to debate the present position with respect to the British-Irish Agreement and, if appropriate, to legislate in so far as we can for those matters which are under our responsibility.  Will the Taoiseach confirm he is prepared to have such a debate and that it will be preceded by a briefing of the Opposition leaders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="296" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did undertake to have a briefing session.  I was hoping I would be able to brief on some finality last week.  I have no objection to a debate before the end of the session but I am not clear whether we will have made any further progress before the session breaks at the end of next week.  Certainly I will arrange for briefings. Arising out of that it will be decided whether a debate is desirable.  If so, we shall have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, Sir, but it is about the allocation of time.  With all due respect I have no opportunity to make this point other than now because the Whips will be meeting tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that a constructive debate in this House before the House rises next week would be a contribution towards overcoming the impasse?  I ask not only for the briefing he has promised but also for a two or one hour debate that would enable this House to give some momentum to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Such debates and discussions have always been positive and if a debate can be arranged I am agreeable to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the legislation to amend the privileges and compellability law is published this morning.  If that is the case I welcome the Taoiseach's keeping his commitment to the House.  Is it the Government's intention that the legislation be taken next week? I presume the Taoiseach understands it is imperative that it be taken this session if the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into allegations in connection with AIB is to be concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to No. 71 on the Order Paper in my name and that of other Deputies, will the Taoiseach agree to take this motion in Government time?  In particular will he agree to introduce urgent legislation to allow for taxi sharing and safeguards for those taxi sharing, particularly in the Dublin area but throughout the country generally?  This already applies in Belfast without any difficulty.  We have been told that legislation is needed here.  I would appreciate if the Taoiseach would consider taking this motion <Col N="297" /> in Government time because there is a serious problem and it would be helpful to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the matter of three promised Bills, particularly in the light of yesterday's debate and my request for a debate on the non-ionising microwave radiation emissions report, the postal and telecommunications services (amendment) Bill, the telecommunications infrastructure Bill and the contractual obligations (applicable law) Bill.  Will these have a bearing on the matter discussed yesterday, particularly in light of the claim that there was a clean bill of health, which is not the case &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general circumstances surrounding the preparation of budget 1999 were the <Col N="302" /> most favourable ever.  Never before was a Minister in the position of having an opening surplus of £1.4 billion or a general Government surplus of almost £1 billion in a period of very low inflation and a competitive economy.  The Minister could also look ahead to the next five or six years of accumulated surpluses of up to £10 billion.  The Minister had a major opportunity to make a definitive attack on social exclusion and the huge levels of poverty in our society.  Instead, he decided to concentrate some resources in terms of taxation on the most deserving people, as he perceived them.</P>
      <P>The Minister's increases in social welfare are a further miserable sop for the one million or more people who live below the poverty line.  The absolute rate of social welfare is disgraceful, given the cost of living.  I welcome the £3 and £6 increases for senior citizens.  The increase in unemployment assistance, however, from £70.50 to £73.50 is utterly disgraceful.  The increase in payments for dependants from £41.20 to £43.20 is also disgraceful.  I wonder when those dependants will organise themselves as a lobby to inquire why they should not receive at least the same amount as the main social welfare recipient in the family. The Minister argues that having allowed the first £100 earned per week tax free to workers, he must maintain a divergence between them and social welfare recipients.  No such excuse can be accepted in regard to rates for survivors' pensions, currently £77.10, invalidity payments at £75.20 or disability allowance at £73.50. When one considers these payments and the one-parent family, blind and supplementary welfare allowances, one can only conclude that the parties which run this House now and in the past &mdash; primarily the conservative Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties &mdash; do not give a damn about a large group of people in our society.  My colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, is currently writing about the duties of citizenship.  Any proper democracy which regards inclusive citizenship as an essential element in its make-up would regard this plethora of social welfare rates as a disgrace.</P>
      <P>On the issue of social exclusion, I was glad to see the Minister included some important projects in some of the more deprived areas.  I welcome the fact he listened to lengthy representations from me in regard to the Darndale/Belcamp community. Twenty five years after the community was established, community facilities are eventually being provided.  There was a £700,000 shortfall for the project and I welcome the fact that the Minister, following representations I made to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, has decided to provide the money this year.  Some of the representatives from Darndale and Belcamp will visit Lenister House today to expedite the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment figure currently stands at about 211,000 or 7.8 per cent.  Two-thirds of the 95,000 jobs created last year for which the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, <Col N="303" /> Deputy Harney, claimed credit are part-time, particularly in service industries.  This highlights the urgent necessity to introduce a national minimum wage long before April 2000.</P>
    <P>Like many others on this side of the House, I am disappointed with the measures introduced in the budget to reduce the long-term unemployment figure which currently stands at about 70,000.  A sum of £25 million is to be made available to create 7,000 skilled places and £2.5 million for 40 jobs clubs.  As Labour and Social Democratic parties hold power in 13 of the 15 member states of the European Union, the Minister had no option but to cobble together an employment action plan for which she has provided no extra resources.</P>
    <P>The local employment service has been extremely successful on the north side of Dublin in providing mentor and other programmes.  It should be extended to other areas as soon as possible.  The possibility of integrating it with local FÁS offices should be considered.</P>
    <P>To remove some of the under 25s from the unemployment register the resources available for the over 25s, particularly the over 35s who find it difficult to return to full-time employment in the trades and applications for which they were trained, have had to be reduced.  The Minister did not succeed, therefore, in securing the necessary resources in the battles at the Cabinet table to target the long-term unemployed, particularly in unemployment blackspots.</P>
    <P>There are now 1.7 million in the workforce which continues to expand.  In some areas there are labour shortages.  To meet demand it has been suggested that women in the home should be encouraged to return to the workforce.  It is projected that women in the home will account for most of the increase in the workforce up to 2011.</P>
    <P>The expert working group established under Partnership 2000 has made interim recommendations on child care.  It has recommended that there should be tax relief of up to £4,000 per child for vouched child care expenses.  It has also recommended that child benefit should be increased.  The Government granted an increase of £3 in the budget in respect of the first and second child.  While cre ches will not be subject to benefit-in-kind and capital allowances may be written off, the Minister for Finance has refused to consider any of the key recommendations of the working group which would cost up to £70 million to implement.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with the housing, education and health care aspects of the budget which &mdash; to use a hackneyed phrase &mdash; was a missed opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for sharing time with me.  In the time available it is not possible to deal in great detail with the measures announced in the budget which was welcomed with euphoria by Government backbenchers. As Deputy Broughan said, it was a missed <Col N="304" /> opportunity, although there are aspects which are welcome.  This is the least one would expect and demand given the huge sum available to the Government.  The question is whether it has acted in the long-term interests of the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance informed us that he had made the tough decision to put money away for a rainy day.  When one looks at the increases in social welfare and what has been done for those on hospital waiting lists and local authority housing lists one has to ask if this is a Government that has declared war on poverty.  While no one can argue that the PAYE taxpayer is entitled to relief, one has to ask what could have been done to resolve the problems in health, education, housing and child care.  On each of these crucial issues the Government had a choice.  It decided not to deal with them in a constructive way.</P>
      <P>On the health crisis, extra funds have been allocated but it is too little too late for the tens of thousands on hospital waiting lists.  While we would all like to have a little more in our pockets, we would also like the health service to respond immediately to the needs of patients, be they public or private.  We would also like the education service to meet the needs of the marginalised and the disadvantaged through the provision of remedial teachers and specialised services.</P>
      <P>Everybody would like to see the problems of escalating house prices and local authority waiting lists addressed.  These priorities have been ignored in the short term by the Government at a time when hundreds of millions of pounds was available.  It does not bode well for the inevitable rainy days ahead.</P>
      <P>There should have been a better attack on the health crisis and further funding should have been made available to education and to deal with the housing crisis.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government with responsibility for housing, Deputy Molloy, made an announcement a few weeks ago regarding extra provisions in his Department.  We were told that 600 extra local authority houses would be built.  This is an apparently impressive stand alone figure, yet given the state of the housing lists in every town and county, it will make no impact.  While the crisis cannot be solved in one budget, I appeal to the Minster for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to look at the urgent need for extra funding for local authority housing and other methods of addressing the issue.  It is of little consolation to give a worker at the bottom of the PAYE scale £3 to £6 per week extra if he or she has inadequate accommodation and does not have access to proper housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Broughan's comments on child care.  Is the Government engaged in an ideological debate on the issue?  We must accept the realities of modern life.  In most houses both partners must work because of mortgages of £80,000, <Col N="305" /> £100,000 or £150,000 and huge financial commitments. We have a duty to provide financial support for these families so that proper child care facilities can be provided.  We talk about the need for the Government to be pro-family and we pride ourselves for being a pro-family State. However, it is anti-family to ignore the issue of child care.  Much more needs to be done here.  We must ensure that where a spouse wants to work or has no choice in the matter, sufficient assistance is available for the cost of child care.  That would be a proper step in the provision of a mechanism to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>Over the past five or six years the motor industry has benefited greatly from progress in the economy, but it did so because the Government responded to the industry's view, expressed for at least the previous decade, that if taxes were reduced the motorist would respond by buying newer and better cars, that extra revenues would be brought into the Government coffers, that more people would be employed in the motor industry and that dangerous cars would be taken off the road.  When the Government introduced the scrappage scheme and made it easier to buy new cars the public responded.  New car sales have reached record levels, more jobs were created in the industry and the Revenue has benefited accordingly.</P>
    <P>To everybody's surprise policy has now been reversed.  The Minister for Finance said the increase in VRT was an environmental measure. However, it is mistaken and I hope he will revisit the proposal.  It will not take any old cars off the road.  People will buy second hand rather than new cars and jobs will be lost in the industry. Every Minister makes mistakes in his budget that leave a negative impact of some kind.  The attack on the motor industry is an example and the proposal should be reversed.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this budget debate.  This has been a landmark budget.  It is comprehensive, progressive, developmental and caring.  The Minister for Finance deserves all our thanks for the prudent way in which he managed the national finances over the past year and a half.  It left him in a position to allocate the resources available to him.  In doing so, he succeeded in producing a fair and balanced budget and he used the opportunity to be most helpful to those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resources were available to the Minister because workers worked hard over recent years, management was progressive and professional and the trade union movement was responsible and always had the best interests of its members at heart.  Employers and farmers took the same approach.  Our good economic performance has <Col N="306" /> resulted mainly from the structure of partnership Government and the partnerships programmes, which have been exceptionally positive and successful over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The budget is important to every sector of the economy.  The agri-food sector has been given a very generous allocation, which is very welcome in view of the difficult times experienced by agriculture and farming over the past few months. The budget will contribute to and maintain national economic growth generally, while also ensuring that we care for those most in need.  It is a difficult task to strike the right balance, but the Minister for Finance is to be commended for his efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the difficulties faced by the agri-food sector in the past few months.  There were two primary causes: the collapse of the Russian market and the very difficult weather. Ireland depends to an inordinate extent &mdash; up to 85 to 90 per cent &mdash; on foreign markets and lost out, especially on the Russian market.  That was compounded by the fact that our EU partners also lost this valuable export market, thus resulting in our having to compete strongly on the EU market.  The international markets for pigmeat also suffered badly, not just from the Russian crisis but also from the effects of the weakness in the Asian markets and a serious general oversupply in the EU pigmeat markets.  This meant that the cattle, beef, sheep and pigmeat markets suffered badly from low prices over recent months.  The international markets for pigmeat also suffered badly, not just from the Russian crisis, but also from the effects of the weakness in the Asian markets and a serious general oversupply in EU pigmeat markets.  The cattle and beef markets, the sheep markets and pigmeat markets all suffered badly from low prices over the past few months.</P>
    <P>As each new development unfolded I responded effectively in a swift and comprehensive manner to counter the negative effects.  I will briefly recount the wide range of actions I have taken to date.  For example, total direct income payments this year will amount to £1,023 million. This has set a new landmark in that they, for the first time, represent over half of aggregate, that is 55 per cent, of farm income.  This record figure reflects the speeding up of payments by the Department of Agriculture and Food; an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent; and a special package of almost £20 million, including £10 million in fodder payments, £6 million for a mountain ewe destocking scheme and almost £3 million in sheep headage top-up.</P>
    <P>Other key actions I have undertaken during the past few months include: winning substantial increases in export refunds for beef and pigmeat, export refunds for beef were increased by 9p from 43p to 52p, there was a 33 per cent general increase for export refunds for pigmeat and a 75 per cent increase in export refunds for pigmeat destined for the Russian market; getting private <Col N="307" /> storage schemes for sheepmeat and pigmeat &mdash; 70,000 tonnes of private storage for pigmeat; and obtaining increased access to intervention for heavier cattle.  I call on the industry to use those achievements and facilities, particularly increased access to intervention and the aid to private storage scheme for pigmeat.  As I said publicly on several occasions, I am disappointed the meat processors have not used the improved intervention arrangements or the improved APS scheme more extensively.  However, the reality is that without the availability of intervention support it is doubtful if the fall in cattle prices would have been arrested.</P>
    <P>The figures for farm income released by the CSO on Monday this week show that aggregate income fell by 4 per cent for the year as a whole. While average farm income would have fallen by less than this, as farm numbers are declining, the result is very disappointing, coming after last year's decline and in view of the very good income performance in the previous five years during which average farm incomes improved by some 50 per cent.  The 1998 figures mask different performances in different sectors.  For example, dairy farmers had a good year while cattle sheep and pig farmers were hit by substantial price losses.  Nevertheless, the CSO figures show that overall agricultural output value for the year fell by less than 1 per cent.  There was an increase in the cost of production, the input side of the equation, which was more problematical.  Input costs are estimated to have risen significantly and depreciation also increased.  The latter is good news in the sense that it reflects the very high levels of investment in recent years which will stand to the agricultural industry for years to come.</P>
    <P>We estimate that direct agricultural payments to farmers will reach the record level of in excess of £1 million in 1998.  That is an extraordinary figure and a 9 per cent increase on last year's figure, which was an all-time record.  This level of direct subsidy payments to farmers shows how strong my commitment is to supporting the sector.  While others made a good deal of noise and issued wild and exaggerated statements, I worked hard to ensure that farmers would have the support they needed and this is why the income figures are better than many people had anticipated.  Farmers are entitled to compensatory payments.  I was Minister in the early 1990s when these direct payments were negotiated and they are an important buffer in these difficult times.  I ensured that extra resources and staff were provided in the Department and compliment the staff who worked overtime and unsocial hours over weekends to ensure the extra payments were issued to farmers.</P>
    <P>With this budget the Government has shown its continuing recognition of the difficulties faced by farmers and its continuing support for the sector. This budget has delivered in two key areas, in providing further support for our most severely disadvantaged and marginalised farmers; and in <Col N="308" /> providing a number of measures which will strengthen the competitiveness of the industry for the future.  For example, the 1999 Estimates provide £814 million gross for agriculture and food, a record figure.  That is a net increase of 19 per cent, which will underpin the sector during this difficult period and build for its future development.</P>
    <P>The measures in the budget are well balanced. They will provide assistance to low income farmers and our rural communities, while also strengthening the competitiveness of the sector for the future.  Low income farmers will benefit from the introduction of the new smallholders assistance scheme.  They will benefit from headage support payments of £111 million for next year and other general social welfare measures including the new <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension.  Rural communities will benefit from Leader and INTERREG payments of £40 million and from the £50 million special allocation for rural water and sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>Other measures include the extension of the 25 per cent general rate of stock relief and the 100 per cent special rate for young trained farmers to 5 April 2001; and an increase in the flat rate VAT refund from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent.  The value of that flat rate VAT refund will be approximately an additional £11 million for the coming year, making its total value in excess of £100 million. Farmers in isolated rural areas, particularly in the west, will benefit from funding for REPS, which was increased by 21 per cent for the coming year.  The take up in that scheme has been fabulously successful.  The total allocation for next year will amount to £176 million, which is in the order of £3 million per week for that scheme alone.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to be able to help secure an allocation of an extra £25 million to allow for the reopening of the farm investment schemes, including the control of farm pollution scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme and the scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  A total of £10 million over three years has been allocated to the scheme of installation aid.  An increase of up to £73 million has been provided for the farmers early retirement scheme, £42 million has been provided for disease eradication and controls and £6.5 million has been provided for the national beef assurance scheme.  That is an important scheme to ensure we continue to trade and maintain our presence in the valuable beef market worldwide.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased with the budgetary provision for low income farmers.  It allowed for the introduction of a smallholders assistance scheme.  The new scheme has several significant advantages over the previous scheme.  Under the new scheme, the means test applied to farming families to assess eligibility for the scheme will be changed.  The new system provides a £100 disregard of annual income for each of the first two children, and a £200 disregard each for the third and subsequent children.  Additionally only 80 per <Col N="309" /> cent of remaining income will be counted for the purpose of the means test.  As a result, many farm families who do not currently qualify for assistance will now qualify, and many families who already qualify will be eligible for higher rates of payment.  For example, a farmer with a spouse and two children, earning £100 per week, would have qualified under the old scheme and received a weekly payment of £38 per week.  Under the new means assessment system that same farmer will receive almost double that amount, £66 per week.  A farmer with an income of £150 per week, who has a spouse and two children, would not have qualified for the old scheme, but under the new scheme will qualify for a substantial weekly payment.</P>
    <P>The number of participants in the scheme is expected to almost double from 6,800 under the old scheme to almost 14,000 under the new scheme.  The scheme will cost in the order of £45 million next year, but as it is demand-led it may be more or less than that depending on the number of farmers who apply to participate in it.  The essential matter is that the Government has always recognised the important role the farming community plays in maintaining the fabric of rural society and this new scheme reinforces our commitment to them.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision in that regard is in addition to the recent decision by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> contributory pension which will benefit all self-employed people, about 8,000 in all, who were aged 56 or over in April 1998 and who have at least five years paid contributions since then.  This scheme will cost an additional £18 million.</P>
    <P>A provision of £111 million is being made for headage support payments in 1999.  This includes a further substantial allocation from the Exchequer.  Over the six years of the Structural Funds programme a total of £718 million in cofinanced and non-co-financed funds would have been paid out under the headage schemes.  These payments benefited 100,000 farmers in disadvantaged areas.  These are the most deserving farmers. The payment of £718 million over the past six years is substantial and because of front loading in these schemes, almost half of that money has come from the taxpayer or the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £40 million has been made for the Leader and INTERREG schemes.  These programmes encourage and support development initiatives by local groups and rural communities.</P>
    <P>Earlier I mentioned the allocation over three years of £50 million for rural water and sewerage schemes.  This allocation involves two programmes, one relating to facilities in small rural towns and villages, and one directed towards improving water quality in private group schemes.  With the concentration of industry around urban centres, and the consequent migration, people often forget that nearly 40 per cent of our population still resides in rural areas. This £50 million was badly needed in those areas <Col N="310" /> and once more shows our commitment to maintaining rural society.</P>
    <P>The provisions made for improving the competitiveness of the agri-food sector for the future include measures to improve the age structure, protect the environment and strengthen further action on food safety and quality.</P>
    <P>With regard to the age structure, this budget sees the introduction of a new, targeted national scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  The scheme will be funded by the Exchequer at a cost of £10 million over three years.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the farmers' early retirement scheme has been increased to £73 million for this year.  The early retirement scheme, which applies to farmers over 55 years of age, has assisted the hand over of land to younger farmers.  To date more than 250,000 hectares have been released to young farmers to improve the viability of their holdings, thereby improving the structure of the industry overall.  To date over 8,000 eligible farmers have joined the scheme and are receiving pensions of up to £10,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Some specific agricultural tax measures were introduced in this budget.  The general 25 per cent rate of stock relief and the 100 per cent rate for young trained farmers have been extended by two years, from 5 April 1999 to 5 April 2001.  This measure has a dual purpose &mdash; to encourage further investment in stock and to encourage the participation of young trained farmers.  Both of these measures will be worth a total of £1.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The flat rate VAT refund will be increased from 3.6 per cent to 4 per cent.  The rate change will ensure that farmers continue to be compensated in full for the VAT they bear on their business inputs.  The change will cost £10.76 million in a full year, while the total benefit accruing to farmers is in excess of £106 million per annum.</P>
    <P>There have been many measures introduced in this budget for the purpose of maintaining and improving the environment.  The rural environmental protection scheme has been very successful in the past.  A measure of this success is the high level of participation in the scheme &mdash; 38,500 to date.  The 1999 allocation shows an increase of 21 per cent to £176 million.  This will allow more farmers to participate in the scheme and to avail of attractive supports for farming in an environmentally friendly way.</P>
    <P>I have worked hard to secure the reintroduction of the farm investment schemes.  Application forms for the scheme will soon be available.  An additional £25 million has been allocated in this budget, bringing the total allocation to £36.5 million. This allows for the reopening of the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes.  This funding is in addition to the £45 million which I have already secured for on farm investment since taking office and meets the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The newly introduced schemes will be more focused in their approach than in the past, with the <Col N="311" /> emphasis on assisting the smaller, more marginalised farms.</P>
    <P>In strengthening the development of our food industry, food safety and quality must be given the absolute importance they deserve.  The market demands a strong focus on disease eradication and control.  In response to these demands, we have increased the budget allocation by 18 per cent to £42 million.  This will ensure that the systematic and comprehensive disease control measures which are already in place can be further strengthened.</P>
    <P>Still on the theme of food safety, we have maintained our allocation of £6.5 million to the national beef assurance scheme.  Provision in this area is to ensure that the national infrastructure for cattle traceability and the associated quality control checks are implemented.</P>
    <P>The marketing of beef in the future will depend more and more on the guarantees we can offer our customers on the safety and the quality of the product, as well as its traceability to the farm of origin.</P>
    <P>The agri-food industry will also benefit from the changes introduced in corporation tax.  The 4 per cent reduction in the top rate of corporation tax is significant and is the first of many reductions intended to reduce the rate to 12.5 per cent by 2003.  This step should attract further investment and aid competitiveness and job creation.  Equally important for small business is the increase in the threshold for the low rate of corporation tax, from £50,000 to £100,000.</P>
    <P>The farming sector will also benefit from some of the more general taxation and social inclusion measures introduced in the budget.  Income tax has been changed dramatically in preparation for a move towards a tax credit system.  The basic personal allowances have been standard-rated and substantially increased.  These changes will remove from the tax net 80,000 taxpayers, who would otherwise be liable for tax and I am confident this measure will include many farmers. These changes are worth £581 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Budget improvements in social welfare will cost £288 million in a full year.  Its focus on the elderly will be especially welcome in rural areas. In addition to increased old age pensions, the budget provides for improved eligibility conditions for the medical card for people over 70.</P>
    <P>The tax and expenditure items I have outlined are a well balanced package of measures to support the agri-food sector.  They will contribute both to assisting the sector in its short-term difficulties and to supporting its long-term development. Our objective is to ensure that farm families get a decent income and that they have a realistic future in the sector.</P>
    <P>Farm families and rural communities generally will benefit substantially from the broader tax reform measures in the budget and the improvements in social welfare rates.  Most importantly, this budget will contribute significantly to the <Col N="312" /> continuation and reinforcement of our current economic success.  This is vital to us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about Deputy Broughan.  He seems to be suffering from political amnesia.  He excoriated the Government on a number of issues, particularly education and social welfare.  It was the Government of which he was a member which froze teacher recruitment. The present Minister has reversed that decision and 450 new teachers have been recruited.  The adult education budget has been doubled twice by the present Government.</P>
      <P>The funding for social welfare when the rainbow Government left office was £215 million.  In 1999 that figure will have increased to £305 million. Child benefit was inexplicably reduced from £26 million in 1996 to £25 million in 1997.  Thankfully it will increase to £41 million in the next year.</P>
      <P>It makes me wonder if political amnesia is spreading through the Labour Party and Democratic Left in advance of their new incarnation on Sunday.  After that they will be able to claim in a Kafkaesque manner that they have never been in Government.</P>
      <P>The budget announced by the Minister for Finance on Wednesday will be seen in the future as one of the best budgets, if not the best, introduced since the foundation of the State.  I am delighted that much of its content will improve the living standards of all those in the constituency I serve, Dublin North-West.  The majority of the population in my constituency is in the lower to middle income group.  The taxation measures in the budget will ensure that many of them will no longer be eligible for income tax.  Those who are liable will find the burden greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>The reductions in income tax announced by the Minister constitute the greatest single improvement to the financial benefit of the taxpayers of this State.  In saying this, I am conscious that this is only the second of the Minister's five budgets and by the time he has delivered his fifth, all of the citizens of this State will have achieved a level of affluence which would have been inconceivable 20 years ago, when unemployment was rife, inflation was rampant, the standard rate of income tax was 35 per cent and the higher rate was 65 per cent.  This is a tribute to the prudent economic policies of Fianna Fáil in Government. It would not be indulging in hyperbole to recall the words of the late Seán Lemass that the rising tide has raised all the boats.  We still have not reached full tide.</P>
      <P>While the taxation aspect of the budget is by far its greatest achievement, there are many other aspects which commend themselves to the House. Not only have the commitments given in Partnership 2000 been fulfilled, in many cases they have been greatly exceeded.  On income tax alone, the commitments have been exceeded by 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All social welfare payments will be at or above the levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, again fulfilling the commitment in <Col N="313" /> Partnership 2000.  The rate of these increases when compared to the rate of inflation is also a matter for satisfaction.  For instance, the rate of increase in the retirement or invalidity pension for those over the age of 65 is over twice the rate of inflation.  I am delighted to note that the increase in pensions is being brought forward to the beginning of June.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently on a Private Members' motion concerning pensions.  I noted then the manner in which the self-employed were restricted in making pension provision for themselves when compared to others who were eligible for membership of occupational pension schemes.  I am pleased, therefore, that the budget allows for a substantial improvement in the position of the self employed in this regard.  Not only have the levels of contribution allowable for income tax been greatly increased &mdash; up to 30 per cent of net relevant earnings for all those over the age of 50 &mdash; but the rates allowable for all those over the age of 30 have been improved considerably.</P>
    <P>With regard to that same motion, I am also pleased to note that the Minister has made provision for the self employed who were excluded on grounds of age from qualifying from the contributory old age pension.  This provision also extends to access to the free schemes.  The 8,000 pensioners and 2,000 qualified adults who will benefit from this will be greatly pleased.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note the Minister's statement on the requirement under self-employed pension policies to purchase an annuity on the date of retirement.  There is no doubt that the lowering of interest rates has had a significant adverse impact on the value of the pension which may be bought from the pension fund on retirement under the law at present.  Any method which can be adopted which will assist will be appreciated.  Consideration should be given to extending the same treatment to members of occupational pension schemes, who are equally affected.  Provided the safeguards that apply to existing arrangements can be maintained, I see no reason a change in the need to purchase annuities may not be considered.</P>
    <P>I am confronted on a daily basis in my advice centres with problems of social welfare, health and unemployment.  The ability of all to conduct our lives with dignity and confidence is crucial to the well being of society in general.  The extent to which we in Government can contribute to that well being will help in no small way to overcome the problems I encounter.  The social welfare measures introduced in the budget will go a long way towards improving the status of those who, through age or infirmity, are no longer in a position to influence their own lives in this respect.</P>
    <P>One measure of our success in solving the problem of unemployment is that the Minister has been able to abolish the employment and training levy.  One sure way of reducing my workload is the Government's continued commitment to reduce the unemployment rate to 7 per cent by the end of next year.  Especially noteworthy is <Col N="314" /> the announcement of the pilot project of 1,000 places, confined to those who have been unemployed for five years or more.  I find it very heartening, in one sense, to see the number of signs in shop windows announcing staff vacancies.  I recently heard reference for the first time in a long time to Fianna Fáil's policy of full employment and I hope we will continue to press with all the means at our disposal to achieving that aim in the early years of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his address to the House that there was no reason we cannot achieve further substantial employment growth.  He quite correctly focused attention on the need to ensure the unemployed acquire the skills which will enable them to gain employment.  These skills are important if Forbairt and Enterprise Ireland are to be able to continue their success in attracting overseas investment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred last week to the necessity to focus attention on areas of significant urban unemployment.  The Minister has allocated £15 million for the purpose of upgrading FÁS training and community enterprise facilities.  I look forward to being able to say we do not have an unemployment problem in my constituency.  The measures announced will contribute to helping this come about.</P>
    <P>Ballymun is part of my constituency.  The development of Ballymun took place in the 1960s to overcome the chronic housing shortage in the inner city at that time, which arose partly as a result of the success of the first programme for economic expansion introduced by Fianna Fáil. During the 1970s, however, Ballymun became synonymous with social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil constituency organisation in Dublin North West lobbied successive Ministers to refurbish the area during the 1980s.  We were delighted when the initial refurbishment programme was announced.  The beneficial results of that programme were immediately obvious and the decision of the Government to support a complete rejuvenation programme was a source of great satisfaction to us.  I was further delighted by the Minister's specific reference to Ballymun in his budget speech and the allocation of £28 million to include this programme in the coming financial year.  This is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to replace social exclusion with social inclusion.</P>
    <P>The state of a nation's health is surely as good an indicator of its well being as the state of its wealth.  It is even more important if one believes the old Irish proverb &mdash; is fearr an tsláinte ná an táinte.  Being able to afford to maintain one's health is a contributory factor in itself.</P>
    <P>The medical card is possibly the single most important item in the lives of many people. Improvements in medicine generally mean that people are now living longer but the cost of medicine can place a considerable strain on people, especially as they grow older.  Therefore, the Minister's announcement of an increase of onethird in the income guidelines for eligibility for <Col N="315" /> the medical card for those over 70 years of age in the coming year will be very welcome to those who will now qualify.  The Minister's promise to double the income guidelines over the next three years will be a source of great comfort to those who will qualify for a medical card as a result of this change.</P>
    <P>Just as important as the medical card for the elderly is the medical care of the young.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, by the recent announcements regarding the children's hospital in Temple Street.  This hospital is in the constituency adjacent to mine and numerous generations of children from my constituency have benefited from the care they received there.  Temple Street Children's Hospital is an essential feature of medical care in the north city of Dublin.  It is a considerable advantage and comfort to the people of the north city area to know the services which this hospital provides will continue to be provided in the same area in the future.</P>
    <P>The medical services, generally, have been under a great deal of pressure recently.  The Minister is to be commended for the additional £8 million he has allocated to reduce waiting lists. Almost half of all State expenditure over the coming year is allocated to the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs, a total of £8.4 billion.  I hope these allocations will lead to a reduction in future allocations for those Departments, and that the improvements in people's well being generally and the abolition of hospital waiting lists will help bring this about.</P>
    <P>I have commended many aspects of this budget.  In so doing, I have referred to the commitments made in Partnership 2000.  This agreement shows how the social partners, working in co-operation with the Government, can play a part in improving the economy.  Fianna Fáil was the first party to sit down with the social partners and plan a process which, in turn, has led to the present economic wealth of the country.  The continuation of that process will ensure that our current economic status can be maintained into the new millennium.  People speak about the feel good factor which is undoubtedly evident around the country, notwithstanding the difficulties in some areas.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it struck a chord <Col N="316" /> was because it referred to the poor of the Third World and that they would have no joy at Christmas.  There are many people in this country who will not know it is Christmas as a consequence of this budget and there will be no joy for them in the months leading up to next Christmas either.</P>
      <P>There was an attempt to withdraw the Christmas bonus from the 10,000 people on supplementary welfare.  Thankfully, public spirited officials drew the matter to my attention and sent me copies of the documentation, as a result of which I was able to shame the Minister &mdash; who first tried to justify the withdrawal of the Christmas bonus &mdash; into restoring it.  However, he only restored it to the level at which it was paid last year.</P>
      <P>I wonder if there is any Christmas joy in this budget for the 35,000 people on hospital waiting lists, who cannot understand why, in a country of full and plenty, they must wait for up to a year for a much needed operation.  Is there any joy in the budget for the 45,000 people on housing lists &mdash; an increase of 40 per cent since the Government came into power &mdash; who have been told there will be 600 extra housing starts next year? What impact will that have on the 45,000 people on the waiting list, which is estimated to increase to more than 50,000 next year?</P>
      <P>Is there any joy in this budget for the 6,000 people who are homeless on either the streets or in emergency accommodation?  Is there any joy for the one million children who will receive the magnificent increase of £1 per month?  Only 25p per week can be afforded for them in this budget. Is there any joy for the 27,000 farmers who are below the poverty line?  If one divides up the £5 million allocated in the budget to deal with their situation, one will find that about £170 a year will be available to relieve the poverty of each farm family.  Is there any joy in the budget for those who rely on social welfare?  A disabled man who is married with four children will get nothing until next June; he will then get £3, his wife will get £2 and his children will get nothing.</P>
      <P>The song I spoke about at the beginning, &ldquo;Do they know it's Christmas&rdquo;, referred to the Third World, an area in which I had huge interest when I was a Minister of State in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Can the Government justify the fact that for the first time in eight years, at a time when the country's coffers are overflowing, we are cutting the percentage of GNP going to the Third World?  This is happening despite the silly protestations of the Minister of State who did not carry out her threat to resign when there was no further increase in Third World aid.  I will come back to those issues in a moment because there are some broader considerations that we have to debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of society do we want?  We have great wealth now and I am delighted about it, but in relation to the distribution of that wealth there are decisions to be made.  Do we want a budget that contributes to the creation of an underclass? <Col N="317" /> The Minister for Finance had unprecedented and virtually unlimited resources at his disposal.  He had a choice to make in relation to the poor.  He also had a choice to make in relation to tax, and thankfully his decision there reversed the original approach adopted by this Government in totally favouring the rich.  I approve of those choices.  I approve of the fact that the Government has changed course from what I referred to last year as the &ldquo;fat cat&rdquo; approach.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to the have-nots in our society, he could have made some impact on the problems of the poor, he could have prevented the poverty gap from widening further, or he could ignore the claims of the poor.  As the Minister for Finance said, he chose to maintain the present situation.  That will contribute to the creation of an underclass in our society.  It would be an overstatement to say that it is Government policy to starve the unemployed into low-paid jobs, but there is some merit in that claim.  At a minimum, the approach of this Government is that the poor and the unemployed will be maintained in frugal existence without a decent quality of life.</P>
    <P>There should be encouragement to move from welfare to work.  However, we have to accept that of the welfare budget less than a quarter relates to the unemployed.  We also have to accept that there are many who, because of functional illiteracy or lack of skills, will never work.  There is a choice to be made.  Do we condemn them and their children to be maintained just above subsistence level?  That is the choice this Government has made, and it is the wrong choice.  When there is wealth to be distributed, the very poor in our society, and the poor in the Third World for whom I have always pleaded in the past, have to be given some priority.  That did not happen in this budget and that is its greatest defect.  Last year the budget concentrated on the rich and ignored the low-paid and the unemployed.  I accept that there was a switch in relation to tax in favour of the low-paid this year, a switch of which I approve, but there is virtually nothing apart from inflation for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Christmas bonus for those on supplementary welfare, I accept the Minister's belated explanation that he did not know what was happening.  However, I cannot accept the approach he adopted once I drew it to his attention. His initial reaction once I drew to his attention that 10,000 people, the poorest of the poor, were going to be deprived of their Christmas bonus because of a stupid, infamous circular that emanated from his Department on 27 November, was to try to justify it.  His initial reaction was to blame the official who sent out the circular and who claimed that this was the right thing to do, and the Minister is responsible for that.  In relation to the issue of who is running the Department and whether the official did this on his own without reference to the Minister, how could that have happened?  Given that it did happen, has the Minister assessed the situation and put measures <Col N="318" /> in place to ensure that it will not happen again? I raised the issue with him last night and he gave no answer.  I challenged him on the issue and he ignored the point.  I raised the issue that good management involves good communication.</P>
    <P>There was, under previous Ministers, an SWA advisory group consisting of officials of the Department and officials of the health boards which met once a month.  I have discovered that that group has not met since November of 1997 under this Minister.  That was the cause of the problem and that is where the greatest negligence on the part of the Minister lies.  He ignored that point in his reply to the debate on this issue last night.  I want to ensure that that will not happen again.  I particularly want to ensure that this Minister does not continue to attempt to justify a measure he took which would have resulted in cutting off the Christmas bonus from the poorest of the poor in our society.</P>
    <P>Regarding hospital waiting lists, I cannot understand why people have to wait in pain for operations.  No explanation has been given as to why that should happen.  The waiting list is 35,000 &mdash; it is like a telephone number &mdash; and is rising. The situation is brought home when one sees somebody in one's clinic whose mother of 70 years of age is waiting for a hip operation and has been told that she has to wait another year, and wait in pain.  Why does that happen in this country of full and plenty?  Why are we closing hospital wards?  Why were 100,000 bed nights taken out of the hospital system this year when there is such demand?  I cannot understand it. The Government has not given an explanation. The miserable couple of million pounds that was allocated in this budget to alleviate hospital waiting lists will do nothing to stem the tide.  The numbers on the waiting lists will go up.  There is a crisis in health care and the one person who does not seem to know is the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  He has to be told, and this Government has to take responsibility if he is not doing his job, as I believe he is not.</P>
    <P>Regarding the housing lists, the cause of the 40 per cent increase is that many people who would normally be able to provide their own housing are now piling onto the housing lists because of asset inflation, which is increasing and will continue to increase.  The measures taken by this Government were too little too late and they will not work.  The numbers on the housing lists are going up and up.  What is even worse is that rented accommodation, in so far as it is available, has gone up by 30 per cent in cost in this year alone. Anybody who has children attending third level education, as I have, will be aware personally of that.  If there are people who cannot afford it, all they can do is to pile onto the local authority housing list, yet, with a 40 per cent increase in the list, this Government has provided for 600 extra house starts next year and trumpets it as a huge benefit in this budget.</P>
    <P>I talked about the homeless and about the one <Col N="319" /> million children getting 25p extra a week next year.  Let me make one reference to the farmers. I could not understand the reaction of the farm organisations to this budget.  I claimed that farmers, and all self-employed people, should be entitled to family income supplement.  It can be done.  It is done in Northern Ireland and in the UK.  There is no problem, provided the political will is there.  This Government decided not to do it and instead trumpeted an increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The money available now was not available to previous Governments.  We now have the money, but the wrong decisions have been taken.  The political will does not exist.  I have investigated the situation in Northern Ireland.  It can be done properly, correctly and fairly.  According to independent analysts there are 27,000 farm families living below the poverty line.  There are many others self-employed in the non-farm sector in urban and rural areas who are also living below the poverty line.  The FIS should be made available to them.  However, the Government has said farmers' dole will be extended and it talks of £15 million.  The farm organisations were totally gullible in their response on budget day as £15 million is a phoney figure.  If one examines the small print in the budget and its principal features one will find a figure of £5 million for 1999.  Five million pounds is being provided for 27,000 farm families &mdash; husbands, wives and children who live in the country &mdash; leaving each family with less than a couple of hundred pounds for the entire year.  This is the extent of the munificence of the Government in dealing with the problem.</P>
      <P>As far as the poor are concerned this budget is pathetic.  The have-nots have not been looked after at a time when there is full and plenty in Government coffers.  There is provision for a £1 billion surplus in the budget.  I believe this amount is understated and that the surplus will be £1,500 million by the end of 1999.  One tenth of this figure is being granted in total social welfare increases.  This is the extent to which the poor of the country have been looked after, in stark contrast to the bookies and gamblers who will benefit to the tune of £24 million per year as a result of the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a choice as to whether we want to continue to be the country in Europe, apart from Portugal, which pays the lowest amount of money in social welfare.  Do we want to be highlighted in the UN human development report as having the highest proportion of people living in poverty in the industrialised world, apart from the US? Do we want to continue with glaring inequalities in society?  There was a time when we did not have money to deal with these problems.  My contention is that we had to encourage enterprise to create a wealthy country.  We now have a wealthy <Col N="320" /> country and the question arises as to what to do with our wealth.  Do we encourage those who are rich to become richer by halving the capital gains tax as was done last year?  Do we encourage people with stocks and shares?  Today Goodbody Stockbrokers, a very good firm on whose advice I rely, issued its report.  There is a 20 per cent increase expected on the Stock Exchange next year.  Whom will this benefit?  I am not saying this should not happen, but at the same time we should be cognisant of the demands and needs of the poor in society and make a conscious decision to direct a reasonable proportion of the wealth of the country to deal with those needs.  The budget clearly has not done this and its failure in this regard is its most glaring defect.  It has contributed to a widening of the poverty gap.  If Ireland is to care about its poor it does not need this Government which does not care at all about their needs.  For this reason the budget must be rejected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for sharing his time.  I wish to focus on the budget in the context of business.  The key areas for most businesses are corporation tax, employment and income tax, work incentives, labour market flexibility, PAYE allowance, business regulation, housing policy, child care, training and education. These are all very important in the context of the huge role played by small business.  A vibrant business sector is crucial to the economy in generating employment and income.  The small business sector, for which I have responsibility, makes a significant contribution to the ability of the Government to provide the essential services of health, social welfare and education.  The sector has played a fundamental role in creating current economic growth and continues to be the central source of sustainable, long-term jobs.  In 1998 alone the small business sector will create over 53,000 jobs, bringing the aggregate employment growth beyond 100,000 in the past three years. This figure speaks volumes and clearly shows that with the right environment, small business will translate economic growth into jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment gains of recent years, particularly those in 1998, must be built upon in the coming year.  What must be tackled very aggressively, and this is where the budget failed in many ways, is a reduction in the burden of taxation on business and the regulation and simplification of form filling.  Action must be taken on the Government's commitment to the reduction of corporation tax, something it has moved on.  It is also necessary to maintain a low inflation environment, address specific labour market issues and concerns regarding child care provision and education, refocus expenditure from direct employment schemes to market led training for the unemployed and further training for those in employment.  We should examine FÁS training schemes, especially in the context of people not being able to take time out to take up direct training schemes.  Incentives given to employers to <Col N="321" /> provide in-house training would prove very productive.</P>
    <P>Not all elements of the so-called give-away budget have been given the thumbs up in business circles.  Many firms say they will receive no benefit from it.  IBEC has stated that larger manufacturing firms will be significantly disadvantaged by the hike in the employer's PRSI ceiling as they face rising corporate tax.  For owner-managed companies with a skilled staff base the additional PRSI charge is seen as an unwarranted extra cost burden at a time when payrolls are being squeezed by nationwide skills shortages.  This discriminates against the manufacturing sector which does not stand to benefit from the reductions in corporation tax.  The PRSI adjustment was clearly aimed at securing more tax contributions from companies now that corporation tax is being reduced.  Last week's budget slashed corporation tax by 4 per cent to 28 per cent, and a schedule was announced which will result in corporation tax of 12.5 per cent for all firms by 2003 in partial recompense.  The ceiling applies to 12 per cent of employer's PRSI rate, but was increased from £29,000 to £35,000, resulting in an estimated additional charge of £720 per employee.  No firm will argue against lower corporation taxes, but while PRSI charges will mean additional costs for all, the change in corporation tax will not benefit the manufacturing sector.  The reduction in corporation tax has certainly assisted the maintenance of employees by companies.</P>
    <P>Reliable estimates for the cost of the PRSI measures are not available as yet.  However, a company in Dublin with 300 employees has estimated an additional annual cost of £100,000. Every company with more than ten or 12 employees will suffer to some degree.</P>
    <P>The treatment of child care in the tax and social welfare systems is a key factor in determining work incentives for spouses and female labour force participation.  An increase in the supply of quality child care facilities has the potential to increase the supply of labour and thereby ease the pressure on many sectors experiencing labour shortages.  There is evidence suggesting that recent increases in the cost of child care have driven labour force participants out of the labour market.  A working group established under Partnership 2000 has not furnished its report.  The budget provided a very insignificant amount in the context of the report.  It is critically important that the report is brought before the House and that action is taken on it.  There are many employers who cannot get staff because of the child care situation.</P>
    <P>Improved levels of investment in training for people in employment is crucial.  There should be prioritisation of expenditure for those in employment and labour market training for the unemployed should be made more relevant to the current labour market rather than being programme driven.  Employers have the main responsibility for investing in ongoing training and development of their employees.  By international standards <Col N="322" /> investment levels in this area are well below the average.  Action is required to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>Educational policy is a critical factor in determining business success.  Information technology developments and the change to the euro mean that employers should be given tax breaks to invest in their staff.  I hope the Government pushes for a minimum wage, as that would make even retailing a challenging career.  A minimum wage would give people purpose.</P>
    <P>The budget's car taxation proposals have a green focus.  Car dealers suggest a drop in sales of 30,000 cars next year as a result of the increases, though I do not agree with that figure.  The marketing director of Saab Ireland stated that the budget's measures were supposed to be environmentally friendly, but diesel cars, which are environmental sound, would be put off the road. People will shift to two litre petrol cars instead. Those with £30,000 for high powered cars will be able to pay the extra £700 or £800, but our rate of VRT is considerably higher than the European standard.</P>
    <P>The regulatory environment in which small business operates is a crucial component of competitiveness. Over regulation restricts the ability of business to respond to change at a time when the global business environment requires even more flexibility and innovation.  At an EU Council meeting in Amsterdam in June a strong commitment was given to the simplification of the existing situation and the introduction a new legal and administrative regime to improve the quality of community legislation and to reduce the administrative burden on business.  An Irish company with eight employees must spend 1,000 hours per year on the regulatory paperwork, such as VAT, company inspections, PRSI, etc.  Every company must employ a full time secretary to comply with all regulations.  The Government should consider making it simpler for businesses to employ people and to reduce the administrative burden.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in tax free allowances from £79 to £100.  However, employers must be given an incentive to expand their businesses and take on staff.  There is a huge labour market shortage in hotels, restaurants and supermarkets due to the high costs of child care.  The Government is trying to reduce the high unemployment figures, and FÁS schemes should be dramatically changed to help that initiative.  I am disappointed that CE schemes have been capped and reduced. That is disappointing for those who wish to train people.</P>
    <P>The strategic management initiative report is long overdue.  A central regulatory unit should be set up to ensure that future legislation will make life easier for businesspeople.  A business test panel should be set up to assess the administrative consequences for business of any new legislation. We must look at Fruit of the Loom where 2,400 people are affected.  The service sector, in which I work, employs many people, but very <Col N="323" /> little support has been given to it.  This budget failed that sector dismally, apart from the tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>The £3 for social welfare recipients was insignificant, while the £6 for old age pensioners would just buy a bag of coal.  The economy is booming and we have the biggest surplus ever. Much more could have been done for people in need.  Social housing is a major problem &mdash; 2,000 people are waiting for houses in Sligo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Member referring to unlimited resources being available to the Government is not living in the real world.  The country's finances are healthy; there is no question about that.  However, our national debt is in the region of £30 billion and we pay £2 billion per annum in interest.  That cannot be ignored.  The message that the Minister for Finance gave during the budget must be borne in mind.  If Opposition Deputies were in Government they would say the same if they were true to their ideas of fiscal rectitude.  We have prosperity but we cannot blow everything.  We all know that there will be future periods which are not as good as the present, and it is wise and prudent to try to ensure that we have something in store for those periods. We must reduce debt as far as we can.  We do not need to eliminate it, but we need to reduce it.  For every £1 billion we lower the national debt by, we will have significantly lower future payments to make from current finances.  We should be honest about our need to reduce that debt significantly to save ourselves pain when the inevitable downturn comes.  That may not come in the short to medium term, but we have all seen economic cycles and we cannot pretend that the good times will last forever.</P>
      <P>Choices were made for the poor in this budget, and the package of tax reforms aimed at the less well off, the lower paid and those on social welfare was very generous.  It compares more than favourably with any previous Government's package.  That needs to be restated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Perry made a constructive contribution on the business sector.  Deputy O'Keeffe criticised us for some of the changes we made to corporation and capital gains tax.  However, if we are to meet the targets which have been set &mdash; nobody in this House has said that we should not reduce corporation tax to the levels to which we are committed &mdash; a corollary is that because business is getting this advantage, it must not be as quick to come with its hand out looking for grants, subsidies and supports for its activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Perry in terms of the need for investment in training, which is very important to the economy.  Business should make <Col N="324" /> such investment with the support provided by the State.  It cannot have it both ways.  All sides of the House are committed to a low tax economy, whether personal or corporate, but the money that is freed up should be used productively for the benefit of the economy, not just for personal or corporate gain.  There needs to be a realisation in business that there are two sides to every story.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Perry's comments regarding small firms and the burden of regulation. Perhaps, now that Ireland has emerged from an era where every right and protection had to be written into law by regulation to one of partnership, it is possible that the burden of regulation can be reduced, particularly for smaller firms, and this should be considered.</P>
    <P>The Government is not in the business of reflected glory, although it could be at a time when the economy is booming as a result of the rigorous restraint practised by previous Fianna Fáil Governments.  It would be very easy for the Government to bask in such glory but it has stated clearly that it has chosen to be judged by what is achieved as a result of these economic good times, not just by the fact that it is in office when times are good.</P>
    <P>Ireland is much more than an economy.  It is a nation whose values and priorities, hopes and dreams must be served and supported by the economy, and that must be our philosophy.  It is important to stress that approach of the Government. We must set out our stall against the development of the pockets of prosperity around the country.  The prosperity we are generating and hope to maintain must be shared across the community, not just geographically.  It must be shared with people on the edge of hopelessness, those we have tended to leave out generally and whose hopes we tend to postpone.  Prosperity, above all, must be shared in a way that allows for continuity because there is nothing more painful for anybody than to raise hopes and expectation and then dash them a year to two later.  We must be prudent about how we maintain the current boom.</P>
    <P>Continuity and inclusion are key concepts which underpin the budget.  I wish to address aspects of it which affect my Department. Increased investment in roads and water services, which I have secured for next year, is an object lesson in continuity.  That investment will promote continued economic growth and ensure that it is environmentally sound and sustainable.  Similarly, funds are being pumped into social housing as part of our drive towards inclusion to share the benefits of the boom with those who currently cannot afford to buy their own homes.</P>
    <P>The infrastructural developments which will result from the budget are aimed at widening the possibilities for town and country alike.  For example, overall State investment in improvement and maintenance of national roads amounts to in excess of £336 million.  That is an important step towards continuity.  If there is to be sustained growth and development then there must be a <Col N="325" /> safe, efficient network of national roads.  If industrial development and economic growth are to be shared widely, one must have the same safe, efficient network of national, regional and local roads.</P>
    <P>High transport costs work against industry and services and the Government is committed to reducing costs.  One of the best of ways to do that is to develop national roads.  Even though national roads constitute only 6 per cent of the total road network, they carry approximately 37 per cent of road traffic.  The investment in this year's capital programme is a massive 28 per cent increase on that provided by the rainbow coalition before it left office.  That record provision will get a number of major projects started. Obviously, the National Roads Authority has responsibility for this but among the major new projects that will start, and are likely to be included next year, are the Limerick-southern ring road, by-passes of Drogheda, Croom and Kilmacthomas and the Newmarket-on-Fergus/Hurler's Cross development.  Work is continuing on a number of other projects, such as the by-passes of Arklow, Donegal and Kildare, the Lee tunnel and the Dunleer-Dundalk motorway.</P>
    <P>The year 1999 will be another record year for State funding of non-national roads.  This is a programme that is crucial to sustain the fabric of rural Ireland.  A record £242 million will be available, which is an increase of almost 19 per cent on this year's provision and of more than one third on the 1997 funding provided by the previous Government.  Unlike previous years, the bulk of this funding will come from the local government fund, leaving the Exchequer to provide only £7 million.  The significant increase in the overall level of funding for these roads next year is evidence of the considerable additional resources generally which will be made available to local authorities next year thanks to the local government fund.  The Government is getting there in terms of our roads.</P>
    <P>Further substantial progress will be made in the coming year in restoring and maintaining non-national roads.  That programme, commenced by the previous Government, is well on the way to reaching the target set for it, which is 2005, and will probably do so before then.  Our roads are supposed to get us from A to B. However, anyone who must do so in Dublin city in recent days and months begins to wonder.  It is not an exaggeration to say that traffic during peak hours, in particular, is similar to a video in freeze frame. In addition to the frustration that causes on an individual basis there is also an obvious economic loss to the country.  However, the possibility that investors might begin to think negatively towards the country or the city because of the clogging of traffic is much more serious.  This must be tackled and we are doing so.  Prior to the budget, the DTO produced its mid-term strategy and between that and the budget £176 million has been provided.  The budget provides £2 million towards the cost of park-and-ride facilities in the <Col N="326" /> Dublin area, one of which has been proposed, by Dublin Corporation, for Finglas.  In time I hope it will be possible to extend these facilities on a wider basis throughout Dublin and in other major cities.  Cork provided a good example of this last year and repeated the experiment this year.</P>
    <P>Traffic management grants will receive a large boost next year with an increase of £15 million, bringing total expenditure on this programme to £24 million.  Those grants will allow progress to be made on quality bus corridors, and we have seen positive feedback on the Malahide Road corridor in recent days.  I look forward to that additional funding leading to further progress in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The images which sum up Ireland relate to the built environment &mdash; new office blocks, apartment buildings and developments of all kinds. Huge cranes hover over almost every city and town.  The emphasis on the built environment should not make us forget our natural environment. In other countries historic spurts of industrial development have too often been at its expense.  We are determined that no such tradeoff will be made in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Next year will be important for the development of our water and waste water infrastructure to ensure there is no deterioration in our natural environment.  Capital investment will exceed £275 million, which is far greater than expenditure in any previous year &mdash; next year's investment in water and sewerage services will be almost double that available in 1997.  That major expansion of the investment programme will mean that the largest and most urgently needed water and sewerage projects will get under way more quickly than any of us would have hoped.  It will also enable water conservation, serviced land provision for residential development, and other measures to support rural development.</P>
    <P>Financing the construction work on a number of largescale projects will form a corner stone of the 1999 water and waste water services investment programme, which I will announce early in the New Year.  Construction will begin at Ringsend sewerage treatment works as part of the Dublin Bay project, which will cost about £200 million and is one of the largest infrastructure projects ever undertaken in the State.  We will also continue work on the major drainage schemes in Cork, Limerick, Dundalk, Drogheda, Wexford, and Galway, some of which cost in excess of £100 million, others of which cost in excess of £40 million.  Those schemes will go a long way towards improving the level of waste water treatment in our major urban centres, will help us comply with the EU directive on waste water treatment, and will facilitate economic development.</P>
    <P>Some £39 million in Exchequer funds was allocated in 1998 to projects under the serviced land initiative, which will support overall projects of approximately £100 million in the coming years and will service enough land for 100,000 housing units, the equivalent of two and a half years' supply <Col N="327" /> at current output levels.  Progress under this initiative will help tackle the supply side difficulties identified in the Bacon report as a crucial contributory factor to the current problems in the affordability of houses.  In the region of £15 million in Exchequer funding will be spent on these schemes in 1999.</P>
    <P>Increased funding for the rural water programme facilitates both the improvement of the quality of water delivered from group water supplies and the construction of small water and sewerage schemes.  I am delighted to have secured funding from the Minister for Finance for two initiatives in this area.  As he announced in the Budget Statement last week, investment of £50 million is to be provided over a three year period, starting in 1999.  This will have two key aims. First, funding of £45 million will be provided to water and sewerage schemes serving rural towns and villages.  In this way, vital infrastructure will be provided to support economic development in these areas and to counteract rural depopulation. Second, £5 million will be provided to supplement other moneys provided by the Department to local authorities to update group water schemes.  This additional money will be directed at upgrading existing private group water schemes which have been identified in successive EPA drinking water quality reports as deficient. Both initiatives seek to redress the imbalance caused by problems in securing EU funding for small and medium sized schemes, and intensify our efforts to tackle poor quality group water supplies.  Some £8 million will be provided in 1999 with the balance made available in 2000 and 2001.</P>
    <P>There are also financial instruments to promote green and environmental taxation.  I am pleased with the measures in this year's budget and more pleased with the Minister for Finance's commitment to seriously examine green taxes and financial instruments in the coming year, in the context of our negotiations on the Kyoto protocol. I look forward to a positive outcome from those examinations, so that we can play our full role in implementing the protocol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, not only for the measures he has outlined but for his approach to the development of his Department.  Those of us involved in local government are aware he has produced innovative ideas.  In my experience this is the first time national Government has provided funding for second class roads in urban areas.  The Minister outlined the 28 per cent increase in road funding, which is unprecedented.  I am also happy to note his comments on the park and ride projects of Cork Corporation and Cork County Council, which were implemented in the city at the last two Christmases and on the occasion of major events.  I am glad he intends to implement it nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also pleased to hear of the major projects which we in Cork have awaited for many years, <Col N="328" /> particularly the drainage of the city island.  This is a huge undertaking, which could cost up to £40 million initially with greater expense possible afterwards.  The Minister is willing to take on these projects and secure funding for them, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>All this is made possible by cohesive management of the economy.  In that light I welcome the budget, in common with the vast majority of people in the country.  It is the Opposition's unfortunate task to pick holes in the budget, and it has admitted that it is a tough job, but they should be positive in so doing.  I will emphasise the good points but will also point out cases where further improvement is required.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to paltry social welfare increases and delays in paying them, particularly to the elderly.  Does he recall that his party held office only two years ago?  At that time the Minister for Social Welfare was Deputy De Rossa &mdash; Deputy O'Keeffe may not have held office at that time but he was part of the Government. When he was Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa gave a 1 per cent increase to the elderly.  No attempt was made to shorten the lapse in the time for payment, which should be changed.  Increases should come into effect immediately after they are sanctioned.  The 1 per cent increase must be compared to the increase this year of 8.3 per cent for the same group.  No amount of wishy-washy talk about caring for the elderly will cover up that fact.  This is the type of avenue the Government has followed.  This is a caring Government and I am happy to be a member of one of the Government parties.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Rabbitte referred to the Minister for Finance.  When he had finished criticising him for his activities seven or eight years ago, Deputy Rabbitte then described him as a lucky Minister for Finance.  The Minister may have used that reference to himself at some stage, but it reminded me of the great golfer Arnold Palmer who, when he was so described, said the harder he worked, the luckier he became.  This also applies to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  He has worked with the Government in taking a completely new approach to the implementation of budgets.</P>
    <P>Up to now, budgets were an annual event. Ministers tried to be populist and as responsible as possible.  However, this Minister for Finance has taken a completely new approach.  There were some giggles last year when he said that budget was the first of a series of five budgets. However, people are beginning to realise that he meant what he said and he could deliver on it.  He has brought a new dimension to the job because of his confidence and ability.  He has the confidence to take the long-term view and has planned on that basis.  All Departments can now plan on a multi-annual basis.  It is, therefore, time that budgets were also implemented on that basis.  I welcome the Minister's moves in that regard as a change from the one year concept.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is best viewed in the <Col N="329" /> changes in income tax.  Last year he received much criticism for implementing Fianna Fáil Party policy.  When I knocked on doors during the 1997 general election campaign, I said that my party's priority was a reduction in tax rates.  The Minister implemented that priority last year in the face of much criticism.  He pointed out then that he intended to tackle the issue of tax credits and related matters this year.  People said he was putting the matter on the long finger, but he delivered on that promise this year.</P>
    <P>People have suggested that the source of those decisions is in other parties.  However, when the Fianna Fáil Party was in Opposition during the term of the rainbow Government, it established a tax policy group under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael Ahern.  Its strong recommendation was a reduction in rates followed by the implementation of a tax credits system.  The Government is delivering on both points.  In addition, the Minister has ensured that a raft of people will be excluded from the tax net, particularly the elderly who should not pay tax at all.  I have sought this move for many years.  The cost of collecting tax from the elderly must be the same as the amount collected.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Members have ridiculed the Minister's decision to remove people earning under £100 a week from the tax net.  Thousands of people in short-term employment and those on job share pay tax and the Minister has ensured that they will be taken out of the tax net.  This type of thinking should be used to help the most deprived sections of society, the elderly and the less well paid.</P>
    <P>Last year's budget was described emotively as a budget for the wealthy.  However, it took a definite and positive approach which has been continued this year and will continue in the next three budgets.  The Minister has outlined programmes which I am confident can be implemented.  It is a well planned strategy which should be followed.  I am glad the Minister paid off part of the national debt.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and it was told that it cost more this year to service the debt than last year although the debt has reduced.</P>
    <P>There has been much lobbying and many glossy productions, but the voice of the elderly is not heard.  The number of elderly people will increase by 30 per cent in the next 15 years, but their needs have not been catered for in terms of health care and other areas.  We must ensure their voice is heard and the Minister has started moves in that direction by allowing tax facilities for people who provide post-operative care, etc.  The Minister will ensure that the voice of the elderly is heard.  There is no need to provide medical cards to everybody because the doubling of the allowances will ensure that people who need medical cards will get them.  The Minister has taken innovative steps and I am sure the House will welcome a changed approach to the needs of the elderly in next year's budget.  The elderly <Col N="330" /> should not be viewed as a problem but as a blessing.</P>

      <P>The budget has been called many things, depending on the perspective of the person considering it.  To the Government side, it is radical and revolutionary, but I view it differently. It is a budget of contrasts.  Similar to the proverbial curate's egg, it is good and bad in places.  The tax reductions and the exclusion of the lower paid from the tax bracket have been unanimously welcomed.</P>
      <P>Many parts of the budget refer to the elimination of exclusion.  However, marginalised people in society have been told that they must wait.  At a time of great financial abundance when money is available to Ministers to spend, people have been told they must wait longer.  Hospital waiting lists may be improved temporarily but they will inevitably increase because the funding indicated in the budget will not shorten the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call this morning from the relatives of a 77-year-old man.  He was told yesterday that he had a serious problem with cataracts and that he would be blind within seven months unless he received treatment.  However, when he contacted a consultant in University College Hospital, Galway, he was told that he would join a two year waiting list.  What does the budget mean to that person?  All he can look to over Christmas is blindness and no treatment for his needs.  The budget cannot be viewed as radical, expansionary, revolutionary or in other bland terms since some people have been even more marginalised.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government outlined his contribution to shortening the housing lists.  Some 27,000-30,000 people are on the housing waiting list while there will be only 4,500 new starts in 1999.  The others are told they will have to wait.  Is that a caring budget? Is that what the Government has decided as the programme for the future?  I could identify several other instances of what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position in regard to the 4,000 physically disabled people in Ireland?  Some 1,200 of those never leave their homes and the only people they meet are those who call on them. They need appliances but the Government has failed to deliver.  The provision of suitable wheelchairs would enable them to go out and meet their friends in the community and be independent. Another 1,200 of that 4,000 need personal assistants to do what we take for granted, to wash, feed and dress them.  At a time of financial abundance, the Government has turned its back on them and said they must wait for another day. That is not good enough.  Some 1,500 physically handicapped people need simple appliances <Col N="331" /> which would make a enormous difference to their quality of life.</P>
    <P>People living in poverty who pay for essential drugs are told that under the drugs refund scheme they must pay more.  They do not have the resources.  They are ill and in need of constant medication.  How can the Government say those people will have to pay more for the essential drugs?</P>
    <P>Ireland is suffering the effects of rural depopulation. Poverty in rural Ireland is rampant.  What has this budget done for the 27,000 farmers identified as having an income of less than £150 per week?  Their income has been cut.  What other group would accept a cutback in income, at the rate experienced by the farming community in the past year, without a revolution taking place? In the agriculture sector we could point the finger at many people who are not doing their job.  On the issue of cattle prices I wish to highlight the abject failure of CBF during the beef crisis to provide one additional market.  It should take up the challenge to go out and sell our beef.  I acknowledge the work done by An Bord Bainne in the dairy industry.  It has maintained and improved quality and has expanded its market throughout the world while CBF has failed to improve the quality of beef.  The reason our beef is rejected by the markets is that CBF has simply done nothing. There must be a review of its contribution to marketing Irish beef.  It has sold out to the processors and has been pushed aside.  The processors have taken the initiative and that is the reason the quality of Irish beef has deteriorated.  Until such time as the Government tackles the area of promotion, An Bord Bia cannot be blamed but it is only nibbling at the edges.  Essentially, it has failed to do the job intended for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The attempt by the Minister for Finance to provide supplementary welfare to the farming community has failed miserably given that on the day the Government took office the Taoiseach said, when making a contribution on the future for agriculture, he did not favour live exports and that it was a matter of processing at home.  The assurance needed to drive agriculture forward was dimmed by the Taoiseach's comments.  It was unfortunate.</P>
    <P>The budget has marginalised more people and told them to wait for a further three years.  Those in education have been told that remedial teaching for those with learning disabilities has been postponed for three years.  How can a parent accept that a child in need of remediation will have to wait three years?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately many commentators on the budget last week seemed to assess it in a rather superficial way.  Snap judgments were made overnight, nearly all of which were based entirely on the income tax package offered. Examining the budget is about assessing the amount of money the State takes from the taxpayer and analysing the services and supports it <Col N="332" /> provides in return.  In short we should ask what it does to enhance and protect the overall quality of life for everyone in society.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to move towards tax credits by standardising the personal allowances and PAYE allowances.  I welcome also the philosophy of widening tax bands to allow people earn more money before entering the tax net.  In the past Fine Gael has clearly supported the idea of people being allowed earn up to £120 per week before tax.  This budget is moving in this direction.  People can now earn £100 per week tax free.  This is the first time resources have been available to the Exchequer to allow such expensive reform.  The Minister should be congratulated on seizing the opportunity. However I sound a cautionary note.  The widening of the standard rate band by £4,000 is seen as a major improvement for many taxpayers.  This is not necessarily so because the vast proportion of this £4,000 band widening merely compensates for the standard rating of the personal allowances. In real terms &mdash; which is money in one's pocket &mdash; a person on an average industrial wage of £15,000 will gain by approximately £6 per week.  This is a welcome improvement but not the radical reform many people would lead us to believe.  The reform would have been far more noticeable if the Minister's first budget last year had been fairer in its distribution.  There is more to assessing the impact on quality of life than tax reform.</P>
      <P>It is less than two months since the people of Cork South-Central had the opportunity to identify the issues of greatest concern to them.  Members of the Government nor Deputy Dennehy will disagree with me when I say the priority issues outlined were transport and traffic, housing and child care. I am disappointed little has been done to alleviate concerns on any of these issues in Cork or nationally.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented increase in house prices in recent years has led to a critical shortage of affordable housing for those who aspire to own their own homes.  Home ownership is central to the way we measure our quality of life and to maintaining the sense of community which for years has set our quality of life above that of other countries.  Young married couples now face the prospect of paying £100,000 or more for a so-called starter home.  Many parents are concerned their children will never have the opportunity of owning their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First-time buyers must be given an edge over investors in the current economic conditions.  The abolition of stamp duty on new houses provided this but the Government had the opportunity to abolish stamp duty on second hand houses in this budget and failed to do so.  The expert report commissioned by the Government identified the shortage of serviced land as a key component in the growth of housing availability.  In spite of announcing more than £400 million additional spending on budget day, nothing was provided to <Col N="333" /> local authorities to allow them to service additional tracts of housing land.  Furthermore, most of the provision in the Estimates is to fund existing major schemes rather than create much needed new ones.  No single measure can have a greater impact on increasing new house supply than the urgent funding of local authority initiatives.</P>
    <P>Government Members have spoken about wanting to assist those who have not benefited from the so-called economic boom.  As social housing waiting lists rise daily, surely this is an area which should have been focused on.  It is estimated that 120,000 men, women and children are currently waiting for a house.  The Minister did not make any extra provision on budget day for social housing.  The Estimates provided for an additional 600 social housing starts in 1999 but this is far too traditional an approach to such an urgent problem.  Increasing the number of new housing starts even modestly is expensive and takes too long to provide any relief to the growing numbers on housing lists.</P>
    <P>It is particularly disappointing to note a lack of innovation in the Government's approach when Dublin Corporation was recently applauded from all sides for purchasing an entire development which will be partly used to alleviate housing list problems.  Other local authorities such as Cork Corporation and County Council are also capable of such initiatives; all they require is funding.  It is cold comfort to those on housing lists that at a time when Exchequer finances have never been better, the Government has not displayed any real recognition of the urgent need for social housing.</P>
    <P>The growing chaos on our roads at peak times has become an everyday event.  In urban areas, the economic costs of traffic delays and inadequate infrastructure have become unacceptable. In the case of Dublin, the explanation offered is that our unprecedented growth rates in recent years have overloaded existing and planned infrastructure. This is not the case in Cork.  More than 20 years ago, local authorities and other interested groups had the foresight to commission and act upon a land use and transportation plan. As a result, Cork city and county has now almost completed £300 million worth of road infrastructural improvements.  The opening of the Lee tunnel next year will see one of the final key elements of the plan put in place.  Economic growth will challenge even this new ring road network. Dual carriageways are of little use at peak times if they are jammed with cars.</P>
    <P>During the by-election, I considered options to tackle the problem up-front.  It involved investment of approximately £12 million in additional new buses and the provision of park and ride facilities on a year-round basis, not just at Christmas.  This would go a long way towards alleviating traffic congestion in the city centre.  At the time of the by-election, Deputy O'Flynn accused me of stealing his ideas on traffic plans for Cork so I know he is in agreement with me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> However, we saw no progress on this issue in the budget.  In spite of all the promises made by the Government parties in the by-election, nothing has been done.  The Minister for Public Enterprise promised to seek EU funding.  That is not enough.  Everyone knows our days of getting funding from Brussels for everything are over.  A sum of £12 million is not a great deal of money to help alleviate the transportation problems of Ireland's second city.</P>
    <P>The words &lsquo;child care&rsquo; are still ringing in my ears from the by-election.  That was the area on which the Fianna Fáil candidate focused and we debated it day after day.  Child care is not a woman's issue, it is a family issue.  As a family issue, it has assumed major importance throughout the country.  In some urban areas, the cost and availability of child care is the most significant issue facing parents and young families.  If we are to deal with shortages in the labour market and increased participation in it, the issue of child care must be addressed.  The quarterly labour force survey published last week revealed that 65,000 of 90,000 new employees were part-time workers.  Many of these would probably have been full-time if progress had been made on child care issues.  Whether parents must work because of mortgage commitments, by choice or because they are lone parents and need to work, the cost and provision of proper child care is a significant problem for many families and for the maintenance of our economic progress.  As recently as six weeks ago during the by-election, people were told how important it was to the quality of people's lives that the child care issue was tackled.  Ministers and other Members of the Government parties reiterated the pre-general election promise that tax relief for child care would be delivered on.  The concerns expressed by 90,000 people in Cork South-Central are representative of the issues concerning all Irish citizens. This budget did not enhance the quality of people's lives.  Of greater concern, it suggests the Government is unaware of the issues of real concern to Irish people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the manner in which the Minister tackled the tax issue through widening the tax bands.  This is something I campaigned for during the 1997 general election campaign and it will serve to put more money into people's pockets. However, the Minister fell far short of the mark in a number of areas.  There was no major investment in public transport which is the key to the solution of many of our traffic problems. There is a need to reduce emissions, particularly from buses which run on diesel which is a dirty fuel known to cause bronchitis, asthma and other respiratory problems.  This aspect has not been addressed.  It is known that sitting in traffic jams can cause stress.  Steps should have been taken, in co-operation with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise, to encourage motorists to switch to cleaner and more environmentallyfriendly <Col N="335" /> fuels such as hydrogen, natural gas and liquid petroleum gas on which the duty was reduced by 1.82p per gallon.  Capital allowances should have been provided to encourage them to change their vehicles.  The rate of VRT should also have been reduced.  Motorists will not volunteer to change or convert their vehicles unless it makes economic sense to do so.</P>
      <P>It is a major disappointment that the issue of child care has not been addressed.  As Deputy Coveney said, there were signs during the Cork by-election that it would be addressed.  I am delighted it is now on the agenda as it is an issue that affects all parents, not just women.  It also affects employers.  IBEC states that there are 70,000 employers looking for staff.  Women in the home who wish to return to the workforce have a major part to play.  They are an untapped source and should be facilitated.</P>
      <P>I spoke yesterday to a woman in Cork who has two children and is on a salary of £12,000.  Out of the £200 she brings home each week she has to pay £120 to a child minder.  The figure can be as high as £150 in Dublin.  She wants to work as she believes she has something to offer.  She returns home happier and fulfilled.  Her wishes should be respected.  Others wish to remain at home with their children.  Women account for 50 per cent of the population and should not be lumped in one category.  Many are not happy staying at home with their children as they feel unfulfilled and this leads to untold problems in later life.  Many have to work for economic reasons.</P>
      <P>Something should be done to increase the availability of facilities.  Capital allowances will be available only to certain employers.  This is discriminatory. Unlike Telecom Éireann, the ESB and from next year Leinster House, many small employers cannot provide cre±che facilities.  They should be assisted to avail of facilities in a local kindergarten or creche.  Something has be done for parents with large mortgages who are committed to their jobs.  No one will take their children. It is disappointing that this issue was not dealt with in a more meaningful way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget will make a real difference.  The people we represent are educated and know from the past that in bad times one cannot spend one's way out a recession.  Equally, in good times there are limits to what can be achieved in a single budget.  What is required is a strategic approach where immediate improvement in living standards and services is part of a wider medium-term plan aimed at making progress on seemingly intractable problems.  People know about the importance of a clearly thought out set of priorities and financial planning framework for their personal finances.  They demand no less where the Exchequer finances are concerned.  It can be said with conviction that the most financially astute of households would be happy with the degree to which medium-term financial planning <Col N="336" /> and prioritisation of social objectives underpin the budget.</P>
      <P>By providing a degree of certainty over the medium term, the Government enables the wider economy to tap the potential for enterprise and innovation which undoubtedly exists.  This is not the only role for Government.  The benefits of prosperity must be shared widely to reach the whole community.  In shaping a prosperous future with others in a planned way and in securing the benefits for the weakest members of the community the Government is delivering on the promise of good government.  The budget will not remove the challenges to be faced or the complexity which people will face in their everyday lives.  It will, however, make a real difference to the lives of thousands and in a meaningful way assist them in dealing with these challenges.</P>
      <P>For 80,000 taxpayers there will be a real difference when they are removed from the tax net next April.  Eight times more workers have been removed from the tax net in this budget than the rainbow coalition Government managed in its pre-election budget.  For those on low pay there will be a significant boost with no income tax or PRSI payable on the first £100.  Currently a single person begins to pay tax at £79 per week.  The priority given to the low-paid means that there will be a clear benefit to the unemployed in availing of job opportunities.  The significant increase in the upper income tax threshold will allow many families to keep more of every extra £1 earned. The increase in this threshold for a single person by £4,000 and for a married couple by £8,000 offers considerable extra encouragement to those striving to boost their household resources.  In short, the impact of the Minister's tax package will be profound, not just because of its unprecedented size at £581 million but because it is properly targeted at those most in need, namely those on modest incomes and the elderly.</P>
      <P>Successive national agreements have laid the foundation for our present prosperity.  The tradeoff of modest wage increases in return for significant increases in after-tax income lies at the heart of these agreements.  Partnership 2000 provided for personal tax reductions of £900 million over the period 1997-9.  This commitment has been more than delivered upon with the reductions included in the budget bringing the total provided in that period to £1,500 million.  This is the ideal environment for negotiation of a new agreement with the social partners.  It will allow the competitive position of the economy to be secured into the future and will remove the threat of a return to wage inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax reform has been talked about for two decades, starting with the tax marches of the late 1970s.  The trade union movement and other social groups are now key partners in bringing about radical tax reform and there has been an almost unanimous welcome for the Government's bold move in introducing tax credits.  The Government has not yet reached the second year of what I know will be a full five year term.  Progress <Col N="337" /> across all fronts has been impressive but no more so than in the reform of our taxation system, which is being overseen by the Minister for Finance.  At the end of this term our achievement will be to have used tax credits to transform the tax system and bring about the equity which has been talked about for decades but is at last being fully delivered upon by the Government.</P>
    <P>On coming to power the Government recognised that a substantial shortfall exists in the health area in the funding required for a range of services.  The budget package of £45.5 million forms the final element in the total resources which will make up the original provision or starting point for 1999.  When the revised Estimates are published in January the 1999 figures, compared with the 1998 outturn, will show an increase of 10 per cent in the funding for health, exclusive of hepatitis C payments.  This increase represents the average additional resources available to health agencies in planning the services to be delivered from next January.  The increase is comparable with the very best years in the history of the health services and it is the true test of the Government's commitment to the health services. The funding provided will represent an increase of approximately £309 million in revenue alone next year.</P>
    <P>I wish to specifically mention the areas the Government prioritised in formulating the special budget package of £45.5 million for health and the initiatives that will be put in place as a result. With regard to waiting lists, on taking up office I was concerned to address the delays experienced by public patients in gaining admission to acute hospitals.  In 1998 I increased the funding provided for the waiting list initiative by 50 per cent to £12 million.  However, I was also concerned to tackle the underlying structural causes of waiting lists, and, to establish these I set up a review group on the waiting list initiative.  I have gained Government endorsement for the recommendations of this review group, which were published last week.  As a result, in 1999 £20 million will be allocated to tackle inappropriate waiting lists and waiting times in target specialities.  This represents an increase of 66 per cent in the funding made available in 1998 for this purpose and is 2.5 times the amount allocated by the previous Government in 1997.</P>
    <P>A further £9 million provided in the budget for older people and £2 million for accident and emergency services will be of considerable importance in implementing the recommendations of the waiting list report.  The immediate and medium-term recommendations of the report supply the means of reducing waiting lists and, as the funding secured in the budget shows, there will be no delay on my part in implementing them.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, additional funding of £2 million is being provided in 1999 for accident and emergency services in major acute hospitals.  This extra funding will enable the hospitals to implement various initiatives in keeping with the <Col N="338" /> recommendations of the review group on the waiting list initiative.  These initiatives include measures to free up beds for emergency admissions through the provision, where appropriate, of alternative step down facilities for patients occupying beds in acute hospitals for lengthy periods. It will also allow for the provision of enhanced staffing levels, the development of rapid diagnostic systems for common emergency presentations, continued development of treatment and observation areas in accident and emergency departments and improved access for general practitioners to urgent specialist opinion.  I also expect that part of the extra funding will be allocated to a national public education campaign aimed at increasing general awareness regarding the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>One of the side-effects of the inadequacy of community supports and other health facilities for older people is that beds in acute hospitals tend on occasion to be occupied inappropriately. Improving services for older people is a priority in its own right but it will also form a key part of the strategy to better utilise our acute hospitals. An additional £9 million has been provided in the budget for services for older people which, together with the Book of Estimates' figure, brings the total additional allocation for this service to £25 million.  This includes provision of £3 million for the 33 per cent increase in the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Moffatt, who will speak shortly, is responsible for delivering on the Government's commitments to older people in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  I welcome the fact that the budget means that many more older people will have access to the community supports necessary to allow them to live in their own homes, among their neighbours, with the dignity and respect which they deserve in older age.</P>
    <P>On mental handicap, the budget provides additional revenue funding of £12 million for mental handicap services, with a full year cost in 2000 of £18 million.  This £12 million is in addition to the £6 million already included in the Estimates for these services in 1999 to meet identified needs in existing services.  This brings the total additional revenue funding provided in 1999 for the services to £18 million, with a full year cost of £24 million in 2000.  I will also make capital funding of at least £10 million available to support the new service developments for the mental handicap sector in 1999.</P>
    <P>The total amount of additional funding allocated by me to the mental handicap services since my appointment will be £53 million at the end of 1999 and £59 million with effect from January 2000.  Expenditure by my Department in 1998 on services to persons with a mental handicap amounted to approximately £271 million.  With the additional funding which is being provided in 1999, expenditure on these services next year will <Col N="339" /> exceed £290 million.  The additional revenue funding of £18 million will provide 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places, 200 new day places, health related support services for children with autism, the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements and additional specialist and other support services.</P>
    <P>Nobody should doubt the real difference that this funding will make to the lives of the mentally handicapped and their families.  The funding provided for mental handicap underlines the Government's commitment to meet the needs outlined in the Assessment of Need report within the specified time frame.  I am proud the Government is meeting the targets set in this document and in the process supporting the heroic efforts of the many families and voluntary groups taking care of a person with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Funding of £3 million is provided in the budget for physical disability services.  This will address identified needs in such areas as respite care, day care, home and personal support services, therapy services including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy. In addition to this, £6.4 million has already been provided in the Estimates for 1999 to tackle problems in the existing services including additional support for sheltered workshops.  An additional £4 million for aids and appliances was included in the Supplementary Estimate for 1998 so that an additional £13.4 million is being provided within a 12 month period for the physical disability services.</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of Government policy with regard to people with physical disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable them to achieve the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual and, if at all possible, to live in the community.  There can be no greater fulfilment for a person with a physical disability than to get their independence back and the funding in the budget is needed to put in place the supports necessary to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The budget package for health includes an extra £2 million for child care services.  Some £11 million was already provided for in the Estimates, bringing the total additional revenue in 1999 to £13 million.  The Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Fahey, is responsible for this area and he has a crucial role in co-ordinating child care initiatives across a number of Departments. As a result of the budget he was in a position last week to announce a £28 million national child care investment strategy.</P>

      <P>Given that in most cases Estimates for any area of Government activity tend to be conservative and that there is no unforeseen expenditure in this area, does the Taoiseach not consider it unusual that the Estimate for this area was not reached?  Is the National Partnership Centre located in his offices?  If it is and has not been given the factual and physical independence <Col N="342" /> which it manifestly requires, that is perhaps one of the reasons for the underspend in the last year's Estimate.</P>

It suits it to be based in that location and use the meeting rooms and facilities and it wants to continue to be based there.  I do not have any dealing with it on a day to day basis.  Any time I meet its members is at an arranged meeting.</P>
      <P>This year the board spent a good deal of time in its work around the country.  It promotes the involvement of partnerships, monitors developments, provides technical assistance and support to organisations involved in partnership arrangements, disseminates best practice and provides training for management, union and the employer in the workplace.  It has held a number of exhibitions and conferences around the country. It has spent £400,000.  Its projected outturn at this stage is £397,000 and its estimated expenditure for next year is £414,000.</P>

      <P>For a relatively cheap operation, the National Partnership Centre does a very good job.  There is best practice in a number of industries.  The board has taken the best practices used in a number of industries as models and developed them throughout the country, which is a good way to proceed.  The proof of such exercises is in the result.  Best practices are being picked up and the attendances at the conferences held by the board throughout the country have been higher than it anticipated.  I appreciate the effort put in by Evelyn Owens, Peter Cassells and others who have given of their time because this entails additional work for them.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael Party and I were involved in negotiations for Partnership 2000 which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment and allocation of resources for this centre. Will the Taoiseach agree that one of its primary functions was to measure and quantify the effectiveness with which the concept of partnership was being embedded in the body politic and in our workforce?  If he accepts such an analysis among the other roles the centre has, does the National Partnership Centre communicate with him or has he or his Department a view on how they might measure how successfully the principles and philosophies of partnership have taken root?  If we are to get a fifth successive agreement under social partnership, does he recognise that the measurement of the performance and outturn of the fourth agreement is critical notwithstanding the other three agreements? Are there any proposals on his desk or that have <Col N="343" /> been put forward by the centre that would suggest it is engaging in that type of exercise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doing that.  It has endeavoured to disseminate best practices through studies of those organisations which have successful partnerships.  It has done that.  Where it is in operation and lessons have been learned, it can be accommodated in both the public and private sector. The monitoring of the development of partnership, including the putting in place of a national benchmark survey &mdash; the point Deputy Quinn is raising &mdash; which it can use as a test of whether people are using best practice is very important.</P>
      <P>It has spent a great deal of time this year doing that in conjunction with ICTU and IBEC.  It is developing the training and management programmes to achieve that, again in conjunction with the relevant organisations.  While it is a small organisation, it has secured the co-operation of the Irish Productivity Centre, the Labour Relations Commission, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, ICTU and the universities.  It is a good idea and the centre has done excellent work.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has for the development of formal links and a system of joint study and reporting between the Law Reform Commission and its British counterparts concerned with updating and reform of the law, in particular, pre-independence law; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission enjoys excellent relations with all its British counterparts &mdash; namely, the Law Commission of England and Wales, the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Revision Advisory Committee for Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The various law reform bodies take every opportunity to develop contact and maintain good relations.  For instance, the Law Reform Commission was visited by the Chair of the Law Commission of England and Wales, Dame Justice Arden, in April last.  In October the Review Group on the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice System met with the Law Reform Commission to discuss matters of law reform.</P>
      <P>The links between the Law Reform Commission and its British counterparts are invariably informal in their nature.  Statutory authority for such links exists under section 4 (3) of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, which enables the commission &ldquo;to consult, on any particular matter which the Commission considers relevant, persons qualified to give opinions thereon.&rdquo; However, any system of joint reporting between the commission and its British, or indeed any other, counterparts would be an innovation which would probably require an amendment to the Irish Act and perhaps a corresponding amendment to the relevant statutes in other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>As regards the updating of pre-independence law, the work of the Law Reform Commission to date has frequently addressed various aspects of that law.  Where the work of the Law Reform Commission has involved research into aspects of pre-independence law, as the need has arisen, it has profited from the published research of the Law Commission of England and Wales and of the Scottish Law Commission.  It is considered that the best approach to the reform of pre-independence law is to address specific topics which bear, in whole or in part, on pre-independence law as subjects for law reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the British-Irish Agreement, there is a new mood abroad which would enable both jurisdictions to collaborate in the mutual modernisation of statute law which predates 1921-2.  Best practice in both jurisdictions <Col N="345" /> could be combined through the relevant law reform commissions to produce that.</P>
      <P>I am not clear about the situation in the United Kingdom but I do know what the position is in the Republic of Ireland.  I have been told by the Attorney General's office that we will be publishing all Irish statute law, with all statutory instruments, next week on CD-ROM, with a search and find index system which will enable people to find out their legal obligations post-1922 in a manner which was not previously possible. That facility does not exist for liability in relation to pre-independence legislation.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the reform of pre-1922 legislation, is it not desirable that the British and Irish jurisdictions, which share a a common <i>corpus</i> of pre-1922 legislation, should move to put that into an electronic format which is accessible?</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach request, within the framework of the British-Irish Agreement, that the Irish Law Reform Commission pursue that?</P>

      <P>In terms of the CD-ROM, I have followed up the cost aspect.  The Deputy made the sensible proposal that we should get a cost base.  I have since found out that it is available on the Internet. It is cheap because otherwise people would simply pirate it and the commission would not gain.</P>

Some people might say we do not use much of the pre-independence legislation but it arises every time a Bill is debated in this House. I am sure it is a difficult job and one in which co-operation would be useful.</P>
      <P>I understand the British system is not as far advanced in this regard as we are, which is probably due to the sheer volume of British legislation. However, I will follow this up in terms of the pre-1922 legislation, at least, if not the statutory instruments &mdash; I understand there are tens of thousands of statutory instruments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach turn his attention, in the context of this question which concerns co-operation between Britain and Ireland, to the proposals which have been published in Britain to reform the legal system there? It experiences the same problems as us, such as ever lengthening queues for legal aid, ever inflating <Col N="346" /> legal fees and ever greater uncertainty about how a case will be decided, depending on which judge one happens to appear before.</P>
      <P>There is a genuine sense that the system of justice has become a lottery for most people and it is a matter of luck, as much as anything else, whether one gets justice.  Does the Taoiseach share my view that reform of the legal system is one of the most urgent tasks facing this country as it enters a new decade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is widening the question somewhat.  I do not want to go down that road with Deputy Bruton in regard to access to our legal system, although I agree with him about the high costs of legal services.  The Law Reform Commission has, over the past 23 or 24 years, done an enormous amount of work to assist in amending legislation, deal with new areas of legislation and keep focused on ensuring our criminal justice system is up to standard.  I know there are difficulties in the system but I do not think we should overstate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that one of the principal reasons for high legal fees is that the law is not simple?  The more complicated we make the law, the more people will have to hire lawyers to explain it to them.  One of the reasons for our costly legal system is that this House is not adequately doing its job to simplify the law.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the complexity and cost of getting access to justice is a major political question which needs to be tackled in this House, if necessary on a crossparty basis, so that we will not just have the right laws but laws which are simple enough for people to use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Simple, clear and concise legislation is certainly easier to interpret.  However, we have seen in a number of cases this year and during this decade the ability of people to find ways which are not in legislation and new areas which they can pursue, which is causing the huge cost base.</P>
      <P>The best way for this House to keep matters simple is to consolidate legislation, remove as much as possible of the old regulatory systems and focus on the present system.  We have had an enormous amount of criminal justice legislation in the past few years and I would like to think that has dealt with matters.  However, the reason we are constantly legislating is that there are so many new issues arising in the court system and society, which must be regulated and legislated for &mdash; the absence of such legislation would create other problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to return to a point he made in reply to a supplementary question. Will he agree that one of the reasons for the high cost of law in this country and the United Kingdom is the uncertainty experienced by lawyers in attempting to give their clients an absolute <Col N="347" /> interpretation of the state of the law because of the absence of statutory instruments which give effect to the implementation of Acts of the Oireachtas or Parliament?</P>
      <P>If he accepts that opening premise, will he, therefore, agree that one of the contributions which this Government and the British Government could make, in the spirit of the British-Irish Agreement and for closer co-operation between both our jurisdictions &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; advisedly &mdash; would be to ask the two Law Reform Commissions to identify the main 30, 40 or 100 Acts and their related statutory instruments which govern the day to day activities of the commercial, environmental and other activities of both jurisdictions?</P>
      <P>The facts associated with that corpus of primary legislation and statutory instruments should be put in a format which would be accessible, i.e. CD-ROM.  That would enable both jurisdictions to ensure that costs associated with expensive searches and qualified judgments in relation to legal opinion could be minimised and, in some cases, eliminated.</P>
      <P>I formally ask the Taoiseach to consider requesting, if not directing, the Law Reform Commission, which I think reports directly to the Department of the Taoiseach, to undertake this task in the context of the British-Irish Agreement which is due to be signed and which animates the entire project.</P>

      <P>This jurisdiction has taken responsibility for putting on CD-ROM in an accessible way all post-independence legislation. There is still a corpus of other legislation which is pertinent to some critical transactions and which informs and affects our efficiency as a Republic to do our business.  That legislation interacts with the United Kingdom.  If the United Kingdom is behind us in regard to post-1922 legislation, that is its problem.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to instruct or request the two Law Reform Commissions to identify, out of our 300 or 400 years of shared legislation, the pertinent legislation and statutory instruments, which is the relevant point at issue.  I am asking for these to be identified, transcribed and put into CD-ROM format.  We would share the cost of that project.</P>

However, a number of statements were made earlier in the week which are now being analysed more closely. A number of points have been made in those discussions. I would hope that we can make progress over the next few days, but I cannot be certain about that.  The difficulty is that most of the main players are involved in other business.  Those who are here are involved in the debate in Westminster today and tomorrow they will go on to other meetings.  It looks as though any real negotiations this week will be impossible.</P>

      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view as to the impact of today's motion in the House of Commons on prisoners and on creating a linkage between prisoner releases and decommissioning? <Col N="349" /> What is the Taoiseach's view of the effect that is having on the negotiating position of some of the parties?  Does he agree that the introduction of this new apparent conditionality is making a difficult situation even more difficult?  Does he agree that, while one completely understands the feelings people have when they see, for example, the release of the murderers of the two soldiers who were killed at a funeral in Belfast some years ago, at the same time one must realise that these releases are essential to create the atmosphere in which crimes of this kind will never occur again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton on this.  Dealing with some of these aspects is one of the things I do not have a great deal of stomach for, but it is the only way we can go forward.  Over recent years successive Governments have been releasing prisoners.  The numbers remaining are down to a handful and there is a commitment to release those as well.  There are ongoing discussions about the transfer of prisoners.  There is only a very small number of prisoners left in our jurisdiction.  The Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam has released a large number of prisoners.  To enter preconditions now would be entirely unhelpful.  We are making mistakes in this area. We should keep the focus on resolving the matters we have been trying to resolve for the past four to six weeks, and we should then focus on the other obstacles.  I accept that there are obstacles. Decommissioning and other issues are obstacles around which we have to work.  Bringing in new preconditions is unhelpful.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members of the House who watch the international scene will have noted the difficulties in the Middle East peace process which have arisen entirely because new preconditions are being brought in.  The Middle East peace process is on the verge of breaking down for that reason.  Many of us have had the opportunity of looking at the South African situation and of talking to Mr. Mandela, Mr. De Klerk and others when they addressed the forum.  They stated that what was agreed has to be followed through. Reading back over what Mr. De Klerk said when he addressed the forum, that was one of the things he warned against.  Deputy Bruton is correct in saying that what has happened today is entirely unhelpful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall that one of the others things Mr. De Klerk said was that in a successful negotiation the first thing one must do is put oneself in the shoes of one's antagonist and, rather than think about the needs of one's own community, start by thinking about the needs of the other community?  Is there anything that can be done now to assist a coming together of the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party which in recent days seems to have had some divergent experiences in regard to what was happening?  Is there any possibility, on the basis of the advice of Mr. De Klerk, that the two parties could be <Col N="350" /> brought together to resolve what I believe is a potentially easily resolved issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If these matters were easily resolved, they would be resolved.  However, people take up difficult negotiating positions, when they negotiate at all.  Regarding Mr. De Klerk's advice, I understand why people find it difficult to understand the other side, that some people take the view that certain events happened in circumstances of war while others do not accept that there was ever a war but take the view that what happened was terrorism.  These are different perceptions.  That leads to people being upset and that, in turn, leads to the impossibility of compromise.  In regard to what has been happening in the past few days, I do not want to say anything unhelpful, but people have gone back to old positions to state analogies about the past which are incorrect and do not stand up.  If there are efforts to hold ground, it might be helpful if everybody, including myself, were to say nothing for the next few days until everybody is back.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that we have got ourselves into a rather dangerous if not farcical situation where we are, so to speak, giving out the medals at half time?  We have the awards in Washington, the awards in Oslo and the reality in Ulster, and the reality in Ulster is not great? Accordingly, is the Taoiseach now in a position to indicate, bearing in mind the questions I raised on the Order of Business, that we will have a debate in this House next week on Northern Ireland?  Such a debate would provide this House and this Republic with a platform which could be supportive and helpful in moving the process forward. As a pre-requirement for such a debate &mdash; I am aware that the Government Chief Whip will be meeting later this evening with the party Whips to discuss this matter &mdash; the Taoiseach should provide briefing to the leaders of the Opposition parties, collectively or individually, to ensure that the debate is well informed.  The Taoiseach has our full support in the difficult task he is undertaking.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Bruton and Quinn for having been always constructive on these matters during this session.  I have already made arrangements with my officials to make contact with the Opposition party leaders to give them a full briefing.  A short debate next week would be useful if it can be worked out between the Whips.  Although it would be easy to jump to the bait and agree with Deputy Quinn&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To put the matter in proportion, does the Taoiseach agree that even when all the bodies are set up there will still be crises every so often in operating them and that we should not become overly imbued with a sense of doom and gloom just because these current difficulties have arisen.  Let us keep them in proportion.  Of course there will be differences and difficulties from time to time, even when everything is in place.  We must bear in mind that we are dealing with an area where there has been deep-seated division for 300 years and that this is not going to be resolved in three years.  However, at least what we are talking about now is not a crisis in the peace process as much as a crisis in the political process, and that qualitative difference is a very important step forward.  We are not talking now about the threat of violence so much as the threat of political differences.  That is a qualitative improvement of great importance for which all in this House can take credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but neither do I want to let people off the hook because last year when things were going very well, everybody took off in an acrimonious state on 12 December and straight away the political vacuum during the pre-Christmas period led to a very difficult situation on the streets, difficulties in Derry on the last march of the year, to the murder in the Maze prison of Billy Wright and to a terrible two or three weeks.  A political vacuum is not a good idea.  I would love to take the view that there is no risk for example, in everybody, taking a few weeks holidays, but I do not.  Perhaps I talk too much to people associated with the paramilitaries, but somebody must.  While they want to move forward they continually tell me the political process must move forward.  I can do nothing other than say to the political leadership that they must not allow a vacuum to develop.  My judgment is that what is being done is not a good idea and I and others are prepared to find way out.</P>

      <P>On the other hand is it not the case that those who have used or supported the use of violence in the past have only done so because they have a level of impatience which those involved in conventional politics have <Col N="352" /> learned not to have, that the process of politicising the differences and removing violence from them is naturally and inherently painful, that we must ensure that while maintaining the proper sense of urgency &mdash; I agree with the Taoiseach in this regard &mdash; we keep a sense or proportion and not elevate differences into crises and crises into a deadlock and that we must recognise these issues can be worked through patiently?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>The issue of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was set out by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his reply to a question in the House on 5 November last and also in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday 28 November 1998.  I understand that he also gave a written reply to questions in the House yesterday. I concur fully with his views in relation to PfP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governments intention at this stage is to try to enhance understanding and informed discussion of PfP and also to move that discussion away from the polarised views which have <Col N="356" /> developed and grown around the issue in recent times.  I see this as an entirely sensible and appropriate approach to the matter at this juncture.</P>
    <P>As regards the possible future role for the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities under PfP, participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace the preservation of democracy, the upholding of international law, and the fulfilment of the objectives of the UN charter and OSCE commitments. In addition individual States decide on the scope and extent of participation in PfP activities and in this regard agree an individual partnership programme covering the activities to which it wishes to subscribe.  In Ireland's case, should we decide at any time in the future to join PfP, it is envisaged that these activities would include peace-keeping under a UN mandate, humanitarian and rescue work, etc., tasks in line with our traditional involvement and experience in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>What is preventing a decision from being taken on this matter by the Government? Does the Government believe that there are any implications for neutrality and joining NATO if we join Partnership for Peace?  What are the Minister's views on remarks at the recent RACO conference, where members of that organisation expressed very clearly their belief that we could be left behind in international peacekeeping if we do not join Partnership for Peace?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Participation in Partnership for Peace would not involve membership of NATO, and participation on appropriate terms would not affect Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  This is a voluntary, non-binding, co-operative framework for security development in work which has developed in the post Cold War situation as new democracies have been established in eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>As to why we have not joined, there have traditionally been divergent views on our participation. It is necessary to have open, public discussion of the matter and come to a final decision as soon as possible thereafter.  Deputy Fitzgerald is right on the United Nations probably allocating more peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks to regional organisations.  It is necessary for the Defence Forces to be involved in the training opportunities that participation in PfP would afford them.  That decision will have to be progressed through public debate in order to relieve any worries the public might have before coming to a decision as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When asked, over 70 per cent of the public supported our participation in PfP because they understand that it is a matter of enhancing our role as international peacekeepers and working with other peacekeeping forces in <Col N="357" /> places like Kosovo and Bosnia, where a strong international response is needed.  Can the Minister give the House an idea of the timescale for this decision?  Does he agree that our credibility as international peacekeepers is on the line the more we avoid participation in Partnership for Peace?  Other neutral countries are involved in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Four neutral countries in Europe have already signed the Partnership for Peace document, and that clearly enhances our position if we decide to move in that direction.  However, it is not true to say that our position in the UN has been diminished by non-participation up to now.  We have the second largest contingent in the world involved with UN activities and we are in approximately 13 different countries.  Our participation, involvement and dedication to that role matches the best in the world, considering the resources and equipment we have.</P>
      <P>That said, it is important to move forward and progress the debate.  I cannot give a timescale, but at some stage in 1999, perhaps in the latter half of the year, we should have this matter resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's views appear to be at odds with those of the leaders of the Defence Forces and the Secretaries General of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence. The latter told a Dáil committee recently there are great fears that our role in international peacekeeping is being diminished in no uncertain terms by our lack of involvement in Partnership for Peace.  If we are to continue to be to the forefront in international peacekeeping, as we have been, we must be involved with Partnership for Peace&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The number of claims lodged amounted to 1,488 in 1995, 2,400 in 1996, 6,286 in 1997 and 2,835 in 1998 to 7 December.  The number of out of court settlements was 34 in 1995, 132 in 1996, 1,155 in 1997 and 555 in 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this question down to get an idea of the progression of case numbers since this started in 1995, as well as the number of cases settled out of court.  Is there a levelling off in applications or does the Department see this continuing? <Col N="359" /> Have compensation claims come from the Air Corps, the Navy and the FCA?  Have there been further applications from other sections of the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant downturn in the number of cases coming forward.  It has scaled down from 121 per week last year to 55 per week this year, and it is now at approximately 40 per week.  This is very encouraging but we still cannot say for certain what are the causes or, alternatively, when they will end and it continues to be an extremely worrying factor.  The cases across the different strata in the Defence Forces predominantly involve retired members from the Defence Forces and the next group involves those still serving, with smaller numbers from the reserve Defence Forces, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  There is a substantial difference in the percentages between the groups mentioned by the Deputy and the first two which I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question because it is important to look at whether the number of cases involved is declining &mdash; the Minister has indicated that the number is down to 40 per week. It is still a significant number but there is a decrease.  There was a question relating to the number of cases to be settled out of court.  For example, the Minister settled 1,000 cases out of court one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>The Deputy must ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the large number of cases settled out of court in recent years, is it time to begin discussions between RACO, PDFORRA and the Department of Defence in order to set out an alternative way of dealing with this problem and set up a tribunal?  Clearly, the Department has amounts in mind with which it is happy to settle each case and will compensate for the percentage loss.  The Minister is operating with such a formula given that so many cases have been settled.  Is the Minister considering the establishment of a tribunal to settle cases out of court, which would lead to a reduction in legal and administrative costs and fairness for both the taxpayer and individual claimants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much that there has been a united approach in this House to tackle this issue.  Deputies Fitzgerald and Wall have asked on a number of occasions whether these cases can be solved in an out of court environment. That is my priority but I am handicapped because the Hanly case raised the ante and projection for settling all the cases was substantially increased as a result of that setback.  To establish a tribunal or out of court environment for settlement of the cases, without appealing that case first, would not work because I would be confined to a level of quantum decided by that case, which <Col N="360" /> has been adhered to primarily by the courts since then in out of case settlements and is still at a level too high for those cases involving minor disabilities.</P>
      <P>However, it is a priority of mine to establish an out of court environment to reduce the legal costs.  I have taken a number of steps in recent times in terms of a private scheme following negotiations with the plaintiffs' solicitors to reduce costs.  I have also instructed in regard to the Michaelmas term that the question of negligence will not be fought in the majority of cases. I am handcuffed by the Johnson-Hanly case which set the bar at a level which, if it were to be adhered to across the board, would cost up to £1 billion, between the number of cases already on hand, those that are anticipated, compensation for loss of earnings or hearing and legal and administrative costs.  That is not sustainable as far as the taxpayer is concerned nor is it fair.  I want to move in that direction but I am handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the highest amount paid in an out of court settlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I will obviously get that detail for the Deputy but he can take it for granted that all settlements out of court relate very much to what is anticipated would happen in court and the regular decisions by the courts in such cases.  The amount tends in general to be a little below that, but not by much, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a contradiction between the Minister saying on the one hand he cannot establish a tribunal while at the same time the Department is settling out of court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that these are statistical questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking for the detail of individual cases.  However it seems contradictory that on the one hand the Department has settled a large number of cases out of court with varying costs and, yet, the Minister says that he cannot move to set up a tribunal?  At the end of the day each case will be dealt with individually and there will be variations. The Defence Forces are continuously saying that it is very hard to deal with morale problems as long as this issue is dominating the headlines.  When the Minister attended the recent RACO conference, the issue again dominated the headlines.  Is it in the interest of the Defence Forces to move this issue to a tribunal where settlements could be reached which are already being reached by the Minister out of court anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest damage that could be done to the morale of the Defence Forces would be for me to allow the situation to accelerate to a point where the level of compensation required from the taxpayer to settle the problem would be approximately £1 billion.  Therefore, it is crucially necessary to work the appeals system as best I can to try to get the quantum of award <Col N="361" /> for minor disability down to realistic levels.  In terms of the morale of the Defence Forces, these claims are pursued by members serving or retired. I have said many times that they are hurting us now and will haunt us for a while.  The Department has undertaken positive initiatives to try to overcome that.  We cannot hide from the facts and reality that 12,000 or 13,000 claims have been made, which has not happened in any other part of the world.</P>
      <P>It is not fair to draw a comparison between settling cases out of court and a tribunal because these cases are listed for court.  They are settled on the steps of the court and sometimes after the court has gone into session.  They very much relate to what the courts decided in other cases. What the Deputy and I want is similar, but there must be an affordable level of quantum, particularly for the numbers who have minor disabilities.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that in the survey carried out by my Department on the claims lodged so far this year, 54 per cent have zero disability according to the green book.  To enter a commitment for a tribunal based on the level of quantum which would currently be expected by the plaintiffs' solicitors, and knowing that is the basis of the disability in a huge number of cases, would be reckless.  I need to get to a stage where the courts, the plaintiffs' solicitors and the claimants recognise that the level of quantum that can be afforded for minor disabilities is well below that which is currently awarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is to drag on through the courts until all cases are dealt with, obviously the morale of the Army will be at zero.  Is it within the remit of the Department or the Minister to increase the number of judges processing the cases so that we can get back to what matters most, which is the training and development of the Defence Forces and raising of morale among its members, which all parties want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy and I would give anything, even though I cannot afford much, not to have to deal constantly with a problem such as this and to concentrate on positive areas.  However, we are doing well but our efforts are blighted to a certain extent by this major stumbling block.  This issue will not drag through the courts for years as it would do lethal damage to the Defence Forces.  I am extremely anxious to move to a situation where it can be dealt with much quicker in an out of court environment and save legal costs. However, I cannot do that given the current levels of quantum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 149 together.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for internal security rests with the Garda Síochána.  The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required.  This entails assisting gardaí at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches, including in the Border area.  The Defence Forces also assist the Garda in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts.</P>
      <P>The demands on the Defence Forces in relation to Border duty depend on the nature of the requests for assistance received from gardaí at any particular time.  Currently these requests include the provision of armed parties in aid of the civil power for the purpose of protecting gardaí and the carrying out of such duties as manning vehicle checkpoints and mobile security patrols, specialist search team tasks and explosive ordnance disposal tasks.  The Defence Forces continue to respond to requests from the gardaí in relation to Border security and other operations.</P>
      <P>The comments made by the Chief of Staff at the recent RACO conference relating to the aid to the civil power role are, I believe, expressions of genuine concern regarding the need for a new training regime to update the skills of the members of the Permanent Defence Force to equip them for the range of tasks which they undertake.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to maintain ability to respond, at short notice, to any requests from the Garda for aid to the civil power.  The question of the level of demand on the Defence Forces in aid of the Garda in the Border area following the British-Irish Agreement will be kept under review in my Department, in consultation with the relevant Government Departments as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of helping gardaí and prison officers was extremely damaging to morale and should be reviewed in light of the peace process and changes in the North.  Is the Minister hopeful that there could be changes to this role in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much sense in what the Chief of Staff said.  We do not envisage circumstances <Col N="363" /> in which the Defence Forces would not be required to give aid to the civil power.  It would be in the interests of the Defence Forces, in the medium to long-term, to make troops available for collective training, operational and security duties, particularly in view of any extended role we may have in our UN mandates.  I look forward to discussions with the relevant Departments about scaling down, having regard to the security circumstances, the British-Irish Agreement, Border controls, etc.  We should bear in mind that in the escort of prisoners many things could happen for which the Defence Forces would have to be called in.  They do that job well and do not complain about it even though, as the Deputy said, it is not what they have been trained to do.  We also rely on them to maintain public services during strikes, and they must be trained to carry out technical operations, such as those recently required in Ballymun.  It is not easy but it is important that we scale the operation down in a sensible, proportionate way over time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Has there been any scaling down of the role of the Defence Forces in providing these back up services to gardaí and prison officers, given that there have been changes in the security position?  The Chief of Staff said he would like these duties to be returned entirely to the other services.  Is the Minister actively examining the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no significant scaling down but there is room for it to take place.  There have been discussions between the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner about what the Garda feel they can take over and where we can disengage.  It is at a preliminary stage but it is ongoing and being pursued rigorously.  I have a definite interest in supporting that development and I will see to it that we achieve changes; we expect some, particularly in the Border regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear there have been discussions but it sounds as if they are at an early stage.  Is the Minister confident the gardaí and prison officers have the resources to take charge of these tasks again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In some areas &mdash; which for obvious security reasons I will not detail to the House &mdash; the Garda authorities feel confident they can be primarily involved without aid from the Defence Forces.</P>

UN Security Council Resolution No. 1203 of 24 October 1998 endorsed and supported the agreement and urged states to make personnel available to the mission.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Government decided to allow up to 30 members of the Permanent Defence Force to participate in the mission.  Five military officers are being deployed immediately to key positions in the planning and support unit of the KVM.  It is anticipated that the remainder of the personnel will be deployed to the mission early in the new year, at which stage OSCE selection procedures are expected to be completed.</P>
      <P>At my request, four military personnel visited Honduras between 26 November and 2 December on a fact finding mission to ascertain what humanitarian assistance could be rendered by the Defence Forces over a short timeframe in the wake of the destruction caused by Hurricane Mitch.  A report on the visit is being studied in my Department at present in consultation with the military authorities with a view to assessing what assistance, if any, could be given.  It is envisaged that military personnel would be seconded with pay to a non-Governmental agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and am delighted there has been a move to supply people to Kosovo.  Are there other contingents in that region at present?  There seems to have been an inordinate delay in sending people there.  Is there a reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I can give all the reasons, but one of them was the security of the officers and members of the forces who would be travelling to Kosovo.  The Deputy will understand those difficulties.  Also, if the security position was to deteriorate, there was the question of what exit arrangements would be made.  The mission is unarmed.</P>
      <P>To return to Honduras, to which I alluded in the reply, 24 hours after I spoke to the Chief of Staff about sending people to that country there were 20 volunteers.  I compliment the Defence Forces on that quick response to a difficult mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's initiative in this area, for which this side of the House has pushed in the past, although I do not know whether that influenced his decision.  It is important that we have a small group which can respond rapidly to humanitarian needs.  What was the catalyst for the Honduran mission?  Will the Minister consider establishing a permanent group which can respond to these crises?  He mentioned that volunteers came forward quickly in this case, and the Defence Forces are to be complimented on that, but perhaps there should be a standing <Col N="365" /> group of medical and engineering staff.  Any time the media mention the Defence Forces they home in on the army deafness claims &mdash; they always return to ridicule.  It is disappointing that this welcome move has received little or no publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the members of the Defence Forces going to Honduras are more concerned with the job than with the publicity but it would have helped if it had received more recognition. As I said, within 24 hours of making the decision, volunteers made themselves available. The devastation seen in Nicaragua and Honduras has had traumatic consequences for the local population in terms of loss of life, destruction of houses, etc.  and it is important that we realise what is involved in such a disaster.  I will consider whether we can have a group such as suggested by the Deputy.  I will not say it would be on a permanent basis because there are draws on our technical and medical staff in many areas, such as in the contingents we already send for the UN, but I will undertake to examine whether it is possible to have, on a reasonably continuous or semi-permanent basis, a group which is ready to respond to such disasters.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's indication that it will change its attitude on joining the Partnership for Peace.  However, Deputy Gormley's point is fair.  I ask the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to consider the possibility of a debate on the issue. It has been my party's policy for several years but Deputy Gormley and others of a similar mind should be afforded an opportunity to put forward their views which can then be challenged.  Their views appear to dominate the airwaves and have been unchallenged.  This was particularly the case in the run up to the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 67 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the ongoing investigation into the alleged abuse of duty free facilities by former Irish members of UNFICYP, a combined investigation team of military and Garda personnel went to Cyprus on 1 December.  They returned yesterday and the investigation will now be continued in Ireland.  The wider investigation which was conducted by the UN in Cyprus was islandwide and involved all contingents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the alleged activities of a small number of serving members of the Defence Forces have besmirched the image and reputation of the Defence Forces? It is important that this investigation is concluded as speedily as possible.  Given that the site inspection has taken place, will the Minister indicate when the investigation is likely to be concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As soon as the Department became aware of these alleged incidents, we immediately contacted the United Nations and sought its report.  This was the first step that had to be taken.  Once the report was received, the Department ensured that a thorough investigation was undertaken.  I am not in a position to put a timescale on it at present.  The Department is extremely anxious that it is concluded as quickly as possible and, within the current constraints, I will ensure that it is.  In common with the Deputy, I recognise that any longevity in the investigation would be unhelpful at this time.  I am anxious that it is completed within the shortest possible period.  However, I cannot give a timeframe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give the House any parameters in terms of the extent of alleged involvement of members of the Defence Forces? I understand a small number of people were involved.  Can the Minister give any indications in terms of the parameters of the alleged offence? Is it the case that the alleged scam, which I understand involved more than Irish members of the peace-keeping forces, entailed the abuse of up to or in excess of £1 million worth of duty free goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure may be accurate if one considers that a number of contingents, albeit small, were involved.  In terms of the information available to me at present, it appears that not more than eight members of the Defence Forces were involved and the amounts involved are significantly lower than originally anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My query is similar to Deputy Rabbitte's in terms of the scale of the investigation. <Col N="367" /> Who is involved in it at present and when does the Minister expect it will be completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Garda authorities.  However, as I said to Deputy Rabbitte, I am anxious that the investigation is concluded as quickly as possible.  I do not have direct control over it, but everybody knows that we are anxious to have it concluded as quickly as possible and that appropriate action is taken to deal with infringements and wrongdoing.  The majority of people serving in the Defence Forces during 40 years of service with the United Nations throughout the world have brought much pride to Ireland.  I am anxious that this incident does not besmirch Ireland's name.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge, the answer is no. It involved contingents in 1997 and the early part of 1998.  Ireland does not have anybody serving there at present who was allegedly involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 44 and 148 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The green book was published on 9 April last following which the Civil Liability (Assessment of Hearing Injury) Act, 1998, was enacted on 11 May 1998.  From that date until 30 November 1998, a total of 473 cases were settled out of court while a total of 40 cases were dealt with by the courts.  The total cost to date of these is £11 million. This figure is exclusive of legal costs which <Col N="369" /> in the majority of these cases have not yet been settled.</P>
    <P>In May last, the green book was subject to a test case, Greene <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence.  In the judgment in this case, Mr. Justice Lavan stated in relation to the green book and associated legislation that &ldquo;what is provided for here is a fair and reasonable method for assessing these litigants' hearing disabilities&rdquo;.  In this case the plaintiff, who was aged 60 and had a 2 per cent disability on the green book scale, was awarded £3,000.</P>
    <P>However, another judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Johnson, remained unconvinced by the green book's treatment of the effect of age related hearing loss when combined with noise induced hearing loss and a second test case was required.  This case, Hanley <i>v.</i> Minister for Defence, was heard last July.  In this case, Mr. Justice Johnson also accepted the green book &ldquo;as a fair and reasonable means of calculating disability&rdquo;. However, he went on to say that &ldquo;the green book is not complete and there are some very serious gaps in it&rdquo;.  In this case, the plaintiff, who was aged 35 and had a 7 per cent disability on the green book scale, was awarded £50,575 of which £40,575 was in respect of his level of hearing disability.</P>
    <P>The effect of the judgment in the Hanley case has been to dramatically increase the potential cost to the State of the Army hearing loss litigation.  The State is appealing the judgment to the Supreme Court and I understand that the case is likely to be heard in April 1999.  In the meantime, in the recent Smith case which was appealed to the Supreme Court I understand the court indicated that the green book method of calculating hearing disability is fair, just and reasonable between both parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 33, 47, 48, 98 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>By 7 December, a total number of 13,710 claims for Army hearing loss compensation had been received in my Department.  Of this number, court awards following hearing have been made in 132 cases while a further 113 cases were successfully defended or withdrawn.  Out of court settlements have been reached in a total of 1,910 cases.  Some 11,555 claims are therefore still outstanding.</P>
      <P>The amounts paid out to date are as follows: £2.3 million in respect of 132 court awards; £44.3 million in respect of 1,910 out of court settlements; and £13 million in respect of 1,480 claims where legal costs have been paid to date.  The total cost to date for hearing loss claims is over £59.5 million.</P>
      <P>Administrative costs are currently estimated at approximately £750,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Department of Defence; £850,000 per year for staff and overheads in respect of the Defence Forces; and £795,000 per year for staff and overheads in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  A total estimate for administrative costs is, therefore, £2,395,000 per year.  A provision of £70 million will be provided in 1999.</P>
      <P>The amount paid to date in respect of nonhearing loss cases is £36.9 million in respect of 1,184 claims and there are 763 cases still outstanding. On the basis of an average payment of approximately £31,000 in the cases paid to date, the eventual cost of the 763 outstanding cases would be in excess of £23 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Projections for the likely eventual cost of Army hearing loss litigation are based on an estimate calculated using the formula applied by the courts since the Hanley test case last July.  In this regard, my Department has estimated that the cost for over 11,500 claims which are currently outstanding is of the order of £550 million.  This is based on the pattern of hearing loss established in cases <Col N="371" /> disposed of to date.  If legal costs and damages for matters such as loss of earnings are included, the potential bill is of the order of £1 billion.  This estimate incorporates a number of complex legal and medical variables and it is impossible to be absolutely precise.  However, the figure is conservative and, for example, does not include future claims.</P>
    <P>Regardless of how the calculation of the estimated future cost is approached, the end result is a cost burden which is beyond the limits of any rational economics.  The effect of this cost on the public finances will be damaging beyond reasonable acceptance.  Such damage is not acceptable to the Government and nor do I believe it is acceptable to the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed to learn the Supreme Court case will not be heard until April 1999.  In view of what the Minister has said it will be impossible for the Government to take alternative action until after the Supreme Court case. Given the scale of what the Minister has outlined today and the early stage of resolution of these cases where so few have been settled and many more are still outstanding, is the Government considering an alternative approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this issue earlier. The out of court environment, whether a tribunal or a compensation board system, is the most attractive, sensible and the best way forward. Unfortunately, because of the Johnson judgment in the Hanley case and the implications of that decision, all of the out of court settlements and the court awards since then have been primarily based on that decision.  Following the negotiations with the plaintiffs' solicitors there has been a reasonable drop, in the past few weeks, in the total amount of out of court settlements in terms of the amount per case.  If that were to proceed along those lines in the next couple of months, the option to move forward to the out of court environment, and subsequently reduce legal costs in court time and so on, would be a practical proposition, one to which I am looking.  The Johnson judgment in the Hanley case put matters askew in terms of the total amount which would be required.  Given the number of claims which appear to have zero disability on the green book, to engage in a tribunal at the level of the present awards would be extremely dangerous and wrong from the point of view of the taxpayer and, ultimately, from the point of view of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not a tribunal have to incorporate the green book to be successful?  Is it not an option for the Minister to move forward, establish a tribunal and use the green book with agreed levels of compensation?  If the Minister can get agreement with RACO and PDFORRA this would be a way forward which would give <Col N="372" /> justice to claimants, reduce costs and be fair to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every interest in ensuring a just outcome for the plaintiff, the public and the Defence Forces.  The establishment of a tribunal does not preclude any individual from going to the High Court so long as the High Court makes awards commensurate with the Johnson judgment in the Hanley case.  Why would somebody come to a tribunal for an offer which I would be prepared to make and which I have already outlined to the legal profession, the plaintiff's solicitors, on the scale that is affordable and fair?  I do not mind how much people with severe difficulties are awarded.  The awards can go to the sky as far as I am concerned, to be fair and reasonable.  The problem we face is the huge number of claims with zero to very low disability and the awards from the courts.  The establishment of a tribunal does not take away the right to go to the alternative system.  That is my difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Minister to say that if the amounts of the personal awards being made in court show a diminishing trend, the Government is likely to set up some kind of tribunal?  Assuming it does not show that trend, are we not inviting these matters to be resolved by litigation?  The costs associated with litigation are of the order of a third of the awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Why will the Government not take its courage in its hands and cause a tribunal to come into existence and let that tribunal settle its own quantum for the generality of cases, while anybody who so wishes to appeal to the High Court may do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had discussions with the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor. I had already indicated to the House I was anxious to have the tribunal established before returning from the summer recess.  I would probably have said in the spring that was my ambition. Following the Lavan judgment in the Greene case we were totally on course to establish that alternative out of court environment system.  We then had the subsequent Johnston judgment in the Hanley case.  In our negotiations with the plaintiffs' solicitors the sky was the limit.  Nobody wanted to talk about settlements and out of court arrangements because they had a new quantum. Their system of operation had new fuel.  I had run out of fuel at the time.  However, there is evidence of a little more sense.  If after a few weeks the awards move to more acceptable levels, the option suggested by the Deputy is on the cards.  I do not intend to delay it but I need solid evidence of progress on the quantum for cases with minor disability.  These are the real world questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest a totally new dimension to this awful question.  Will the Minister <Col N="373" /> accept it is utterly outrageous the taxpayer should fund claims which go back 20, 30 and 40 years? Will he accept it was the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1921, that opened the floodgates? Is the Minister aware that the 24th law reform report in Britain recommended that a long stop be applicable to all negligence claims? Does he accept we might have something to learn from that?  Does he agree we are in a situation where £1 billion is payable by the taxpayer in view of the fact that an extra 40 or 50 claims per week are cascading into the Department?  Will he hold discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; if he can tear him away from Kerrykeel &mdash; and urge him to direct his mind to this issue which is seriously affecting taxpayers?  Will the Minister consider an approach which would involve an amendment to the amending Statute of Limitations Act which I believe to be the basic cause of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the day I was appointed, I have grappled with this problem.  One of the initiatives I introduced at an early stage related to a new examination of the Statute of Limitations Act to ascertain how it has worked against the State in cases such as this.  The 1991 legislation was viewed at the time as very reforming legislation.  We have had a number of very traumatic cases such as the hepatitis C cases in which grave wrong was done to women by the State. These would never have been unearthed were it not for such reforming legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we view this issue broadly.  We are still considering the extent to which changes could be made in the Statute of Limitations legislation for the future. As this matter has been in the public domain for a protracted period of time and has received a great deal of publicity, I intend to announce a deadline after which claims which come into the Department will be fought rigorously under the current Act.</P>

      <P>In view of the 11,000 cases which are outstanding and the fact the Minister spoke about the possibility of a compensation tribunal and is speaking to the plaintiffs' solicitors, it is difficult to understand why he is not talking to PDFORRA, the Defence Forces' representative body, to attempt to put in place a compensation tribunal which would serve to alleviate the problems. Has the Minister met with representatives of PDFORRA since the association's AGM in <Col N="374" /> Ennis?  Has he done anything to encourage their involvement in putting a tribunal in place?  What is the current state of play between the Minister and PDFORRA?</P>

      <P>The package for child care provided for in the budget includes an additional £2 million for child care services.  A sum of £11 million was already provided for, bringing the total additional revenue in this area to £13 million for 1999.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, is responsible for this area and has a crucial role to play in co-ordinating child care initiatives across a number of Departments.  As a result of measures contained in the budget, he was in a position last week to announce a £28 million national child care investment strategy.  In recent years, child care services have changed enormously as those who provide them struggled to cope with the major responsibilities they have been required to undertake.</P>
      <P>Almost inevitably, the immediate need to intervene has not always allowed sufficient time and resources to be devoted to prevention.  The Government strategy seeks to provide additional resources in order that this balance can be redressed.  The focus of the strategy will be on supporting vulnerable children in the family and community setting and keeping them out of residential care.  Special attention is being given to addressing the twin problems of homelessness and children who are getting into trouble and coming before the courts.  The budget has provided the resources for a new emphasis in the child care area.  If we can support vulnerable children at an early stage in their lives, we can change their entire outlook for the future.</P>
      <P>Additional funding of £2 million has been provided in the budget for dental services.  This will be used to extend services under the dental treatment service scheme to the remaining cohort which comprises those people between 35 and 64 years of age with effect from 1 September 1999. This will complete the phasing in of the dental treatment service scheme.  All adult medical card holders will then have a range of routine dental services available to them.  The final phase of the scheme will ensure equity and social inclusion for all adults with medical card entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget package for health of £45.5 million builds on the funding already secured in the Book of Estimates.  Total additional revenue in 1999 will be £309 million.  This will allow progress to be achieved in a range of areas, including extra funding for increased costs in acute hospitals, the opening of new theatres and wards, the development of ambulance services, the further implementation <Col N="377" /> of the cancer strategy, the implementation of the national breast screening programme and the cardiovascular health strategy.</P>
    <P>In the personnel area, additional funding has been provided for nurse training and management development, including the further involvement of clinicians in the management of hospital services.  Additional money has been provided for health promotion at local level by health boards and improvements in relation to women's health, violence against women, travellers' health and the mental health services.</P>
    <P>In the primary care area, generally the first point of contact with the health services, there will be significantly enhanced funding.  The general practitioner services will receive increased investment, the community drugs schemes require additional funding and further funding has been provided for ophthalmic services, childhood immunisation, maternity and infant care, family planning and pregnancy counselling, HIV-AIDS services, drug abuse services and the implementation of anti-tobacco legislation.</P>
    <P>Next year will see extra funding across the full range of health services.  I will be impressing on health boards the need to ensure their approach fits in with the overall national strategy in each area and that there is co-ordination of the services being developed within their areas so that the service the public receives is an integrated one.  This will be the basis for evaluating performance and reviewing allocations in future years.</P>
    <P>The capital budget for health will be £205 million in 2001.  This investment is almost twice the level approved by the previous Government in its last year in office.  On coming to office I made it one of my main objectives to radically improve the level of spending on the capital programme in view of past underfunding.  The figure for 2001 will build on figures of £155 million in 1999 and £165 million in 2000 and will allow an acceleration of the commitments that can be entered into during this period.  It will mean that the capital budget for the three year period 1999 to 2001 will be an unprecedented £525 million and this will be used to transform and modernise health facilities throughout the country.  The benefits of this huge increase will be felt throughout all health programmes.  I will be continuing in 1999 and 2000 the medical equipment replacement programme of £10 million each year.  I am making a commitment of £6 million again next year for maintenance of health facilities and various other projects relating to fire precautions and physical safety issues.</P>
    <P>We are seeing the benefits to the economy of reform of the public finances which took place in the late 1980s.  At the time it seemed the country faced one of the most intractable problems faced since independence.  This may well have been the case but by making tough decisions on the basis of consensus the position has been turned around out of all recognition.  Our social problems, many of which fall within the ambit of the health services, <Col N="378" /> should receive the same sustained attention. The improvement of health services is among the Government's highest priorities.  Many of the services being delivered are inadequate to meet the escalating demands of the public.  The story is not unique as most other countries are faced by the dilemma of trying to match finite resources to escalating demand for health care. We managed our way out of the difficulties in the public finances and the Government's strategy for the health services seeks to achieve the same turnaround in meeting the demand for improvements in health services.  It is not about reform for reform's sake or taking a hard line with particular agencies.  It is about improving the performance of the whole system so that we make a real difference to the lives of those who need services.</P>
    <P>The Government's strategy is based on three key elements: first, an increase in the resources provided; second, proper planning of the use of these resources and, third, a partnership approach to the resolution of problems with the interests of the patient given overall priority.  I have spoken at length in the House recently on the themes of service planning and partnership and I do not intend to go over this ground again. No matter what level of funding is provided it is imperative that there be proper planning of services throughout the year.  All staff should be fully involved in this process and, if partnership is to mean anything, must buy into the decisions reached, even the difficult ones.</P>
    <P>The increase in resources being provided next year by the Government is comparable with the best years in the history of the health services. Whatever level of funding is provided I have no doubt that some will manage their resources better than others.  I have little doubt that if there are end-of-year difficulties in agencies in 12 months' time these will be seized upon by the Opposition and I will be called upon to bail them out with little regard for the damage this would do to the mechanism for planning, funding and evaluating services laid down in legislation.  I do not intend to do this.</P>
    <P>It has usually been the lot of the taxpayer to be disappointed by a budget just as, perhaps, it has been the lot of a Minister for Health to be disappointed with his allocation for the coming year.  On this occasion, however, most will see the budget as striking the correct balance and, in particular, that the income tax reductions have gone where they should.  I am happy to acknowledge that the funding provided for the health services will allow for the delivery of the Government's agreed programme so that at the end of its five year term it will be seen conclusively that as a Government we have made a real and lasting difference to the quality of health services available to the public.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  In Opposition my party said it would reduce taxes and improve <Col N="379" /> public services.  The Government's second budget provides tax reductions of £581 million, targeted in particular at the low paid and older people.  It provides funding to improve public services in a number of key areas.  The health sector, in particular, has benefited to the tune of £45.5 million. I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, in securing considerable extra resources for health services.  Money is of use only if it is spent wisely. The Minister's track record in planning with health agencies for service improvements within the total allocation provided by Government is a key factor in securing this additional funding. Unbiased observers can see the planning and control he has shown in managing the health services in the past year.  There is no more difficult and no more important responsibility than health and a Government could not have a better or more committed Minister in charge of this area than Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>My specific responsibilities in the Department of Health and Children relate to services for older people and food safety.  Both these areas have received additional resources in the budget on top of the extra funding for next year provided in the Estimates.</P>
      <P>The need to develop better health and other support services for older people is regarded as a priority by the Government and the additional £9 million announced in the budget is an indication of our commitment to improving services for older people during our term of office.  This, with the figure provided for in the Book of Estimates, brings the total allocation for this service to £22 million.  This does not include the extra £3 million for medical cards, giving a total of £25 million &mdash; £31 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People, the statutory advisory body on issues affecting older people, has identified support for older people in the home, as well as support for carers, as fundamental to improving the quality of life for older people.  This is the consensus view of the various organisations which represent the interests of older people.  I am taking a number of initiatives which will enable health boards to provide greater support for older people in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The home help service is widely recognised as a key service in supporting dependent people in their homes.  Notwithstanding this recognition, it is generally accepted that there are a number of problems relating to the organisation and development of home help services which need to be addressed to realise the full potential of this service.  A report commissioned by my Department has examined these issues and I expect this report to be submitted to me and published in the near future.  In the meantime I am taking steps to deal with the most immediate problems surrounding this service.  A sum of £1.5 million is being earmarked for its development.  This allocation will be used to extend the coverage of the <Col N="380" /> service by providing more hours as well as improving training courses for home helps.</P>
    <P>It is important that older people are not deprived of medical care because of inability to pay.  In line with its commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government has decided to increase significantly the income guidelines for entitlement to medical cards for persons aged 70 years or over.  This improvement, which will be introduced over a three year period, will begin on 1 March next year, with an increase of one third in the guidelines.</P>
    <P>An area of concern to Deputies on all sides of the House is the remuneration of home helps, both in terms of rates of payment and standardisation across health boards.  Accordingly, approximately £3 million in additional resources is being allocated to health boards to bring the minimum rate of payment for all home helps up to £3 per hour from 1 April 1999.  I envisage this as part of a phased improvement in the rate of payments for home helps, the remaining phases of which I hope to implement as resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Government is also aware of the enormous contribution of family carers to looking after dependent older people and other people with disabilities in the home.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs is taking measures to improve assistance to carers through the carer's allowance.  He has increased by £6 the care allowance for carers over 66 years and by £3 the allowance for carers under 66 years.  There will also be a once a year payment of £200 towards the cost of respite care.</P>
    <P>On the health side, I am allocating £1 million as part of the budget allocation for older people to health boards, specifically to support carers. This fund can be used for the benefit of carers in a flexible manner based on local needs.  The improvement of liaison with and support for individual carers and local voluntary groups who promote the interests of carers are examples of the type of support envisaged.  The budget allocations will also enable more paramedical and nursing staff to be recruited and assigned to home care of older people, which, in turn, will also assist carers. A sum of £800,000 is being earmarked for this purpose.</P>
    <P>While support of older people in the home is a very important part of Government policy in relation to the care of older people, there will continue to be a need for residential nursing care, when it is no longer possible for people to be looked after at home.  The budget allocation for older people includes a sum of £1.45 million, which will enable a new 50 bed community nursing unit at St. Clare's, Ballymun to be opened next year, together with a new 27 bed unit in Clonmel.</P>
    <P>The full year costs of contracting an additional 65 nursing home beds is being allocated to the Eastern Health Board, which will help to alleviate the pressure on acute hospital beds in the major general hospitals in Dublin.  Additional funding is also being allocated to health boards to meet, <Col N="381" /><i>inter alia,</i> increased demand for nursing home subventions and the additional costs arising from increased dependency levels.  An additional £9.95 million is being allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Over £3 million has been earmarked for the further development of specialist assessment units for older people which play such an important part in their effective treatment and care.  This allocation is also being used to improve staffing levels in a number of extended care and day care facilities, with a view to optimising the use of these facilities.</P>
    <P>A number of organisations play a valuable role in representing the interests of older people and I have endeavoured to allocate some funding to a number of these groups in support of their work.  The benefits of having specialist-led services for older people attached to general hospitals are well documented and additional funding of £300,000 is being allocated in 1999 to allow four additional physicians in the medicine of older age to be recruited &mdash; two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway.  This will bring the total number of physicians in the medicine of older age to 28.</P>
    <P>With regard to psychiatry of old age services, £500,000 of the development funding provided for services for older people is being allocated to a continuing programme which started last year. This will lead to more consultants in psychiatry of old age.  The provision of a service which meets the special needs of older people who have a mental health problem has been identified as a priority and it is the intention to establish such a service in each health board area.</P>
    <P>I see this package of measures for older people as a continuation of the development programme which we have initiated this year, with my announcement of a greatly improved capital programme for services for older people of £14 million, which has been doubled on last year.  We are moving on all aspects of care of the elderly and on the question of food safety there has been an extra allocation of £4 million together with the £2 million provided under the Estimates.</P>

      <P>The budget has earned several tags.  On the day it was announced it was described as a punter's budget.  Since then it has become known as the convert's budget because a different approach to taxation has been adopted by the Minister by comparison with that adopted for his first budget last year when the interests of the better off were looked after to the exclusion of low income categories.  The Minister has been converted to adopting the taxation policies on which we fought the last general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I prefer to describe the budget as a budget of contrasts.  In its response, CORI described it as good for some, not so good for others, very good on income tax and very bad on tackling poverty. The Minister had an unprecedented opportunity to bridge the gap between the well off and the poorer sections of society.  He had a surplus of £1.4 billion at his disposal, which we could only <Col N="382" /> dream of in the past.  In rating the budget I would be very generous in giving it more than five or six out of ten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a bad mark when the Deputy is not being objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I mark the Minister I am always objective &mdash; it is the teacher in me.  For the income tax payer the budget has been adequate but not generous.  The single person on the average industrial wage will benefit by approximately £6 per week.  It is not extraordinary, and I would not mark that measure more than five out of ten.</P>
      <P>However, the social welfare provisions represent a mixed bag.  The increase of £6 per week for old age pensioners and £3 per week for their dependants is no more than what would be expected in time of plenty.  They have given their lives to working for the country and the least we can do is look after them in their senior years.</P>
      <P>The unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, about whom we must be concerned, will be very disappointed with their miserable increase of £3 per week.  It would not buy them a packet of cigarettes, even before the increase in the price of a packet of 20 announced in the budget.  While an additional £3 per week has been provided for dependants of an unemployed person, no recognition has been given to dependants under the age of 18 years or in education.  The Government has failed badly in this area.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has backtracked over the fiasco of the supplementary allowance, which erupted last weekend, and that those involved will be given the Christmas bonus they deserve. It would be cruel and Scrooge-like if we were to deprive the thousands of people dependent on supplementary welfare benefit of their Christmas bonus.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the failure of the Government to address the problem of child care. The difficulties with child care have increased every year because most parents must work to finance their mortgages.  Children must be cared for inside or outside the home and the Minister has failed to address that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a major housing crisis.  There are between 40,000 and 45,000 people on the local authority housing list.  That is a reflection of the escalation in house prices in the past two or three years.  Even where both partners are working, a couple could not dream of taking out a mortgage of up to £100,000 on a three bedroom semidetached house in Dublin or in many other parts of the country.  As a result many people have had to turn to the local authorities to be housed. There are 2,300 people on the local authority housing list in Donegal, which is the highest on record and the fourth highest in the country.  The local authorities in Dublin have the highest number, followed by Cork and Wexford.  We have been told that only 4,500 new houses will be built <Col N="383" /> in 1999.  That does not give much hope to those on local authority housing lists.  People have been on the housing list in Donegal for five or ten years.  I am sure other Deputies would confirm that is also the position in other parts of the country. Some people have been on the housing list for more than ten years.  They do not have much to be cheerful about as a result of the budget which was introduced at a time of unprecedented surpluses.  The best the Government could do was sanction the building of the number of houses that were built when my party was in a coalition Government in 1986.  The Government does not seem to be concerned about addressing this problem.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people would like to extend, refurbish or carry out essential repairs to their houses.  Many are disappointed that an opportunity to introduce an house repair grant was lost in the budget.  From 1982 or 1983 up to 1987 a generous house repair grant of £7,000 was available, particularly in respect of houses built pre-1940. Householders in every part of the country availed of that generous grant and it changed the face of housing in Ireland.  Many new roofs were funded by that grant.  It is 11 years since that grant was suspended.  The Minister present was probably a Member of the House in April 1987 when one of the first measures taken by his party when in Government was to discontinue that grant. Many people have waited patiently since then for the introduction of another house repair grant.  It need not be as generous as the previous one, but such a grant would be an incentive for people to carry out necessary repairs to their homes.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Health and Children has left the House.  I listened to what he said about his responsibility for hospitals, particularly hospital waiting lists.  The number of people on hospital waiting lists has increased since he took responsibility for that Department. If we are to go by the additional money allocated to address the problem of hospital waiting lists in the budget, matters can only get worse in 1999. The position is critical in the north west, in Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.  In Sligo General Hospital and Letterkenny Hospital the number on the waiting list has increased from 1,644 to 2,374 since last year.  That is an unprecedented increase of 630 people or almost 40 per cent.  The increase in the number on hospital waiting lists between June 1997 and now is intolerable.  According to figures released by the Minister during the week, there are 632 people on the waiting list for Letterkenny Hospital and 1,742 on the waiting list for Sligo General Hospital.  Those figures exclude people from the north west who are on the waiting list for cardiac surgery and other complicated surgical procedures in hospitals in Dublin or Galway.</P>
    <P>Many of those on hospital waiting lists have serious illnesses and suffer from acute pain and discomfort.  It is disgraceful that the Minister has led us into this crisis while the Exchequer is enjoying unprecedented surpluses of billions <Col N="384" /> rather than millions.  The health services are being starved of funding and the most vulnerable sector of our society are the sufferers.  The healthy prosper while the sick suffer, but that cannot be allowed to continue.  The necessary resources must be made available as soon as possible. Those who were looking forward to better news in the budget must be sorely disappointed.</P>
    <P>Donegal got bad news on the economic front this week.  The latest news on the jobs front was the announcement that 780 jobs will be lost in Fruit of the Loom between January and April 1999.  That is a major blow to employment in Donegal.  The factories in Malin Head, Milford and Raphoe will be closed early in the new year and the news could be as bad next year.  The company can only give a guarantee that the remaining 1,300 jobs will be secure up to the end of 1999. This is a black day for my county and the Government must come to its rescue.  The various agencies must be made aware of the position and must act together to replace as many of the jobs that are lost as quickly as possible.  One way to do that would be to make the county more attractive for inward investment.  That could be achieved by improving the infrastructure, particularly the roads that service the west of the county where industries are striving to survive.</P>
    <P>Every sector of farming, whether beef, sheep, pigs or the deterioration in the quality of fodder as a result of the bad weather conditions during the summer, is facing a crisis.  The best that could be done in the budget was to introduce a scheme to extend the smallholders' dole which is means tested.  Any means tested benefit, particularly in regard to farming, has had a bad reputation, especially in the west.  I am disappointed the Minister could not have come up with a more imaginative scheme.</P>
    <P>Statistics show that a 1600cc car is the average family car.  I have been told that the budgetary provision in respect of VRT will increase the cost of the average family car by £2,000.  The motor industry has been buoyant during the past few years and has provided thousands of jobs.  I do not know if it was wise to introduce a higher rate at this time when the industry is recovering from the lean years of the past decade.  It will make it more difficult for the average family to replace the family car.</P>
    <P>It is a mixed budget, worth five or six out of ten.  I hope the Minister will do more to look after the less well off members of society in future.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has a reputation for being a pragmatic man.  It was no wonder he could walk in here and deliver a budget the central theme of which was in conflict <Col N="385" /> with his party's general election platform and with his first budget.  The previous Government lost power advocating many of the policies the Minister brought forward, a strange irony given that the present Government was then so adamantly opposed to these measures.  It makes one ask if pre-election policy should only be aimed at one section of society.</P>
      <P>There has been a broad welcome for this budget.  In the initial days after its announcement it was almost unpopular to criticise it.  However, it had many shortcomings.</P>
      <P>Until recently, budgets brought forward presented very few options.  The parameters within which one had to work were very narrow. In more recent times, due to our ongoing prosperity, the situation has radically altered.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, however, success brings its own problems.</P>
      <P>For me the greatest drawback has been the deterioration in the provision of services.  This applies across the board.  Several companies and professions have chosen to treat the customer with disdain, working on the premise that there are plenty more they came from.  The impact of this approach will only come to light when there is a downturn in the economy.  While all the indicators say otherwise, history has shown that the tide comes in and the tide goes out.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with gazumping, whereby developers suck in a client and while he or she is on the verge of great expectation the rug is pulled from under them.  It is a practice driven purely by greed and it is one of the greatest difficulties faced by young couples endeavouring to set out on the housing trail.  Fine Gael introduced a Bill to prevent gazumping but this Government voted it down.  I am glad that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is here this evening. Giving his reason for doing so, the Minister referred to Article 43 of the Constitution, which deals with private property.  He said the Bill would interfere with individual property rights. That same article, however, goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.</P>
      <P>Legislation could have been introduced in the interest of the common good.  I was interested to see several reports from Government Deputies saying this Bill was not legally feasible.  That is totally untrue.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the rapid increase in house prices continues to be a cause for concern. What does this budget do for private housing? Nothing.  In the area of public housing, it is estimated that there will be 4,500 new starts.  On average this will mean 150 new houses for Wicklow, although there are 2,400 on the waiting list. At the rate this list is growing, there will be more on it at the end of 1999 than there are at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public is getting a raw deal in the housing and building sectors.  This budget does <Col N="386" /> nothing to assist them.  A known individual sent his house plans to four different builders seeking a costing.  As a reply incentive he enclosed £50 with each copy.  Only one quotation was returned to him.  If the boot was on the other foot, there would have been many incentives included in last week's budget, but this Government too has chosen to neglect the customer.</P>
    <P>Several of our service industries have adopted a <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude.  I fear this may have a long-term detrimental effect on the tourism industry.  A general tendency to dismiss has evolved as the hunger to satisfy and accommodate has been replaced by a &ldquo;clock up the numbers&rdquo; attitude.  This budget could have assisted in stemming the drop in standards.  An emphasis could have been placed on providing a quality service and incentives could have been given to award those who provide a quality service.  When people come here from abroad and pay for entertainment, they expect to receive better than they get at home.  Sadly in too many places this is not now the case.  The general public and visitors to the country will only accept such standards for so long.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention that my contribution should be a long list of complaints but it is too easy to reflect on what is in this budget and not examine what has been left out.  It is important to have a balanced presentation.  As the emphasis is always on what is in the budget, someone should present the other side of the coin.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to fairness and the demands it places on us to look after the people who have not done so well in recent years &mdash; the old and the low paid.  The old age pension went up £9 for a couple, a mere £4.50 each.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the agriculture resolution on budget night, the Minister for Agriculture and Food hogged the floor and, among other things, spoke about the millions paid out under the REP scheme.  There is a major difficulty with the uptake of this scheme in Wicklow due to a problem with grazing rights.  I outlined this problem in the House during an Adjournment debate over a year ago.  At the time I was informed that the impasse would be broken in the near future.  To date nothing has happened.  As a result, farmers in Wicklow have received just £3 million from the scheme while other counties have received up to £30 million.  I would appreciate if the Minister for Finance could raise this matter with his Government colleague because there appears to be a lack of will to find a solution.  Unfortunately I did not get an opportunity to raise the matter that evening as the Minister for Agriculture and Food used up most of the available time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's provision for the revamping of the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme at a full year cost of £15 million. A sum of £2 million has been allocated to the reinstatement of installation aid.  We await with interest to hear how this scheme will be operated but I fear the funding is minuscule at a time when <Col N="387" /> we should be encouraging young people to get involved in the family farm.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to three main areas with respect to capital expenditure.  He mentioned the rural water programme and rural depopulation and has allocated £50 million over the next three years to improve water and sewerage structures. Many villages in County Wicklow have no sewerage systems.  To bring the standard of water up to an acceptable level in Baltinglass alone more than £800,000 is required.  That project could conceivably use up Wicklow's total allocation from this £50 million.  The Minister knows that £50 million will not go far.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of public-private partnerships but it is important that the consumers' interests are protected at all times.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wise to put £40 million aside in a contingency fund for the year 2000 problem but it is important that the Department is compliant before mid 1999, as most companies in the private sector will be.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he will look at the possibility of extending the rural renewal scheme on a targeted basis to other rural areas.  He will know from statistic recently published by the Central Statistics Office that Wicklow and Carlow have GDPs of 74 per cent and 73 per cent of the European average respectively.  Given that these figures are lower than four of the counties which have been nominated for Objective One status, I expect the Minister will give priority to Wicklow and Carlow.  He is familiar with both areas and realises that certain parts, despite the perception to the contrary, are greatly underdeveloped. This pilot scheme should be extended by townland rather than by county.  I look forward to the Minister bringing forward details of the concept.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite rightly believes that the tax measures will be revenue creating.  If the rural renewal scheme is fairly implemented it, too, will become a revenue creating project.  However, it must be aimed at areas which have potential for development.  I can readily supply the Minister with a list of areas in Wicklow and Carlow which have potential for development.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to address the shortage of student accommodation.  I hope the necessary developments are constructed in such a manner that they will permit all year round use, similar to the scheme in operation at present in the Corrib village in Galway city.  I do not know how the Minister envisages the project will be financed, but I am sure he will enter into discussions with the various education institutions on the best way to move this project forward.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of his speech the Minister outlined four areas of major concern.  One of these is housing, to which I have already referred.  Another area of concern is the fact that labour shortages are emerging in certain sectors.  The Minister proposes to address this by seeking to get the <Col N="388" /> long-term unemployed and lone parents into skills training courses.  The largest dormant labour force in this country is women who decide to stay at home.  They stay at home for a myriad of reasons, yet the budget does nothing to entice them back into the labour force.  It was expected that some provision would be made in the budget for children but, alas, there was none.</P>
    <P>Our former President often referred to the Irish diaspora.  While many of them have returned home in recent years, many of them still remain abroad.  One of the main reasons they have chosen to stay put is the high cost of obtaining a house here.  No incentive has been put in place to entice this group of people back into the labour force.  Did the Minister or his officials give any consideration to targeting this group?</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment and Local Government spoke this morning about the rigorous restraint of previous Fianna Fáil Governments &mdash; selective memory is a dangerous thing. He spoke of values and priorities, hopes and dreams. I have time to daydream and reflect on values and priorities as I make my way to Kildare Street most mornings.  These dreams are usually interrupted by an irate driver blowing his horn as he seeks to move along after several stationary minutes.  There is no single meaningful measure in the budget to deal with traffic problems.</P>
    <P>Government Members have sought to bask in the glory of this budget.  However, they will see it has many shortcomings in the months ahead, shortcomings which many commentators have either been unaware of or chosen to ignore. When the many problems which have not been addressed resurface in greater form in the year ahead, I will ask Government Members to remember this budget.</P>

      <P>This Government is firmly committed to the development and improvement of public institutions and the services they provide. This is nowhere more evident than in the justice and equality areas.  Under the general banner of the strategic management initiative, my Department has undertaken the most far-reaching organisational reform of the justice system and equality agencies over the past two years. This organisational change programme is ongoing, but has already chalked up significant achievements and will continue until all the planned changes have been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective of this change programme is to bring about a modern integrated system, with each agency in the justice and equality system clear about its own role and its relationship and linkage with other agencies in the system.  This has involved reform of the institutional <Col N="389" /> framework of the entire justice and equality system, including the establishment of new agencies to manage the courts and the prisons, and a restructuring of the Department's role and management systems.</P>
    <P>Projects embraced by this programme include a Courts Service to manage the day to day operation of the courts.  The legislation establishing the Courts Service was enacted last April.  A transitional board has been established and a chief executive officer designate is due to take up appointment in January next.</P>
    <P>Another project is a prisons authority to manage the day to day operation of the prisons.  I announced today that the Government has approved my proposals to establish new and innovative structures for the administration of the Prison Service.  The new measures are a prisons' authority interim board to manage the Prison Service, the appointment of a director general for the Prison Service, the appointment of an inspector of prisons and a board to review prison sentences, to be known as a parole board.  These proposals amount to the most fundamental reform of the Prison Service since the State was founded. They are innovative measures which, as well as adding new momentum to the Prison Service, also mark the beginning of a new approach to the management of offenders.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the recommendations set out in the Garda Síochána SMI report is proceeding as planned.  There has been a review of the role and organisation of the Probation and Welfare Service.  The expert group is expected to conclude its work in spring 1999.  A major investment programme in computerised management systems in the Garda, prisons, courts, Probation and Welfare Service is progressing, with systems due to come on stream next year.  The strengthening of management processes in the Department, through a number of initiatives and a general reevaluation of the role, is now being planned.</P>
    <P>The change programme also involves significant new structural arrangements in the equality and disability areas, most notably the proposed establishment of the equality authority to replace the existing Employment Equality Agency, as well as the establishment of a national disability authority.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new agencies, strengthening of the management function in each agency, development of computerised information systems and reorientation of the role of the core Department are all being supported through additional investment in 1999.  These measures are designed to ensure that the system as a whole operates in an integrated and efficient way, ultimately delivering a better quality of service to the users and clients of the services provided.</P>
    <P>The issue of child care was the subject of much debate in the context of the 1999 budget.  This is a complex issue.  I wish to emphasise that an expert working group on child care, which is chaired by my Department, was set up under Partnership <Col N="390" /> 2000 to devise a national framework for the development of child care services in Ireland and has yet to report.  I understand that the group is finalising a report and recommendations in the coming weeks and intends to publish a final report early next year.  I assure the House that when that report is available, the Government will give full and detailed consideration to the group's recommendations.</P>
    <P>In 1994 a pilot child care initiative was designed and was continued in each subsequent year, up to and including 1997.  As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I sought and obtained Government approval for the conversion of the pilot child care initiative into an equal opportunity child care programme.  This programme is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment.  It is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas.  In July of this year I announced expenditure of £5.2 million on this programme, including EU funding, over the 1998-9 period.</P>
    <P>The National Women's Council is the umbrella organisation representing women's groups.  A sum of £295,000 is provided in the Department's Estimate for 1999.  This is an increase of £95,000 on the allocation for 1998.  A sum of £270,000 is provided for general operating expenses and a special one-off grant of £25,000 is provided for the proposed North-South conference on gender equality to take place in spring 1999.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee, comprised of Government Departments and agencies, women's organisations and the social partners, was established to oversee the implementation of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the actions agreed at the Fourth World Conference on Women.  The committee will publish a third progress report in 1999.  Funding has been provided for an evaluation of the issues still outstanding in the second commission report, to be undertaken in 1999.</P>
    <P>A sum of £300,000 has been allocated to fund a communication programme to promote a greater understanding between travellers and the settled community.  This amount is being provided in response to proposals by the Conference of Religious in Ireland.  The programme aims to address the underlying causes of mistrust between the two communities, while at the same time creating an immediate awareness of certain issues.  The programme aims to inform, share experience, educate and build bridges between the two communities.</P>
    <P>Further evidence of the Government's commitment to improve the position of travellers in our society is the committee to monitor and co-ordinate the implementation of the Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, which I established earlier this year.  I have established a Consultative Committee on Racism and lnterculturalism which will build on the work done by the National Co-ordinating Committee for European <Col N="391" /> Year Against Racism.  The committee comprises Government Departments, State agencies, non-governmental organisations and the social partners.  It will advise the Government on racism and will develop responses to racism and undertake initiatives, research and reports as appropriate. The Department has provided the committee with a premises and £90,000 has been allocated to the committee for 1999.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998 was signed into law in June of this year.  Work is on schedule to put in place the infrastructure for equality provided in the Act.  It is proposed to establish an equality authority to replace the Employment Equality Agency and an office of director of equality investigations to give redress of first instance.  The anti-discrimination provisions of the Act will begin to be brought into operation after the infrastructure necessary to support it is in place, probably in the first half of 1999.  The Estimates for 1999 contain £3.711 million in respect of the equality infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The revised Equal Status Bill, which will prohibit discrimination outside the field of employment, is expected to be published early in 1999. The Bill will prohibit discrimination on nine distinct grounds, in non-employment areas including the provision of goods and services, accommodation and education.  This legislation is being developed following the Supreme Court finding that the Equal Status Bill, 1997 was unconstitutional. As the Supreme Court did not examine the Bill as a whole, production of the revised Bill is a more complicated process and it has been necessary to obtain extensive legal advice before developing the revised measure.</P>
    <P>I wish to affirm, once again, that this Government is firmly committed to continuously advancing the position of people with disabilities, to enable them to achieve a greater independence and to more fully participate in the life of the nation.  It has placed disability on the agenda of every Government Department and public body. As the millennium approaches, we are determined to work towards ensuring that people with disabilities will be provided with far greater opportunities in the 21st century for pursuing a fuller life than has been the case in the past.  Once again this Government has directed funds and other resources towards areas of great need. These additional resources will help to lessen the burden which, unfortunately, is the daily experience of so many of our people with disabilities, their families and carers and will assist in lessening the feeling of exclusion which so often is their lot.</P>
    <P>The range of initiatives which are being undertaken by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Micheál Martin, is an example of the practical way in which this Government is meeting the identified needs of people with disabilities. A sum of £4 million is being provided in 1999 in respect of extra teachers and child care assistants for children with disabilities, £1.7 million for <Col N="392" /> escorts and special harnesses for children with disabilities on school buses and £0.2 million for the purchase of special equipment for remedial teachers.  A sum of £0.25 million is being set aside to provide computer equipment for children with special needs.  The Minister also addresses the educational needs of older people with disabilities through the provision of £0.25 million for people with disabilities in third level education and a grant of £50,000 to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen, has made £18 million of additional revenue available to help tackle the deficit in accommodation for people with learning difficulties and to furnish health-related support services for children with autism.  This money will also assist with the continuation of transfer of persons inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals and the provision of additional specialist and other support services.  It is expected that 320 new residential places, 80 new respite places and 200 new day places will be created as a result of this initiative by Minister Cowen, who is also making available an additional minimum amount of £10 million capital in 1999 for these purposes.</P>
    <P>The needs of those with physical disabilities are not being overlooked as Minister Cowen has provided £4 million for aids and appliances which will bring the total investment in aids and appliances in the past 12 months to £9.325 million. He is also making available £9.4 million in additional revenue for 1999, £6.4 million of which is extra funding to meet additional costs arising from the implementation of existing programmes. The remaining £3 million is for the development of services.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Finance have also recognised the needs of people with disabilities through a range of improvements in existing schemes directed towards those with disabilities.  These include items as diverse as the disabled person's and essential repairs grant schemes, back to education allowance and back-to-work schemes, fuel allowance, benefits to carers, revenue job assist scheme, tax allowance for the blind and the employment of a carer tax allowance, to name but a few.</P>
    <P>Turning to my own Department, I am pleased to record that the allocation for disability for 1999, at £3 million plus, has more than trebled over the 1998 allocation.  Of this amount, £2.021 million is allocated to the newly created National Disability Authority and the remaining £1.065 million will fund a range of disability initiatives with which my Department is concerned.  The NDA, as the authority has come to be called, will be responsible for the research and development of standards for services and programmes provided to people with disabilities.  It will also monitor and evaluate implementation of standards in the services provided.  It will act as an expert body <Col N="393" /> which will assist the Minister in the development of policy in relation to disability issues.  As Deputies will be aware the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998 is currently awaiting Second Stage in Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to provide funding and other assistance to the interim Irish Council of People with Disabilities and it is our intention that an elected permanent council, representative of all people with a disability, will be introduced in 1999.  Funding will be continued into 1999 to the six pilot community projects relating to people with disabilities.  Four of these pilot projects relate to access to information and participation in the local decision-making process and two relate to the facilitation of cross-sectoral planning for delivery of services.</P>
    <P>The draft heads of a Bill to establish a human rights commission in the State with a mandate and remit equivalent to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was circulated to Departments on 3 December 1998.  The Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil on 1 December 1998 that the heads of the Bill when ready would be circulated to the Committee on Justice, Equality and Women's Rights and the Joint All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution prior to Christmas, provided this would not delay progress on the Bill.  It is the intention to have the heads of the Bill approved by Government shortly, with drafting of the Bill to take place in January 1999.</P>
    <P>The work on the Bill has involved extensive contact and co-operation with relevant agencies in the neighbouring jurisdiction in view of the commonality of the commitments entered into by both Governments in this area.  The views of other interested groups have been taken into account and the Department has been in contact with organisations with a particular interest in the area, including the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  Due regard has also been paid to the UN Paris Principles which contain an agreed framework for national human rights institutions such as commissions, the report of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in the matter and the 1996 report of the Review Group on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Work on the other main commitments in the agreement concerning human rights &mdash; the question of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights &mdash; is being taken forward by the Department in the context of strengthening the protection of human rights in this jurisdiction and against the background of the report of the constitution review group and the work of the Joint All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>A sum of £7.195 million has been set aside in this year's abridged Estimate at subhead H of Vote 19 for the refugee determination process. An additional sum of £1 million has also been provided for the establishment of an independent refugee legal service to assist asylum seekers in <Col N="394" /> exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum process.  The refugee legal service will be run by the Legal Aid Board and should be fully operational by the end of February 1998. With the introduction of new procedures and the recruitment of additional staff I expect that we will see a noticeable improvement in the processing of asylum claims &mdash; the target is to have cases completed through all stages within six months.  Accommodation has been obtained and fitted out as a one-stop-shop for the asylum division of the Department, the Eastern Health Board refugee unit and medical screening unit, the UNHCR and a documentation centre.  The new refugee legal service will also be based at the one-stop-shop.  I have commissioned a comparative study between Irish and EU refugee legislation which should be completed by the end of 1998 and, together with our experience to date of the new procedures, will be an important component in the review of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to confirm my Department's continued support for Victim Support. In 1999 this organisation will receive a total of £651,000 towards its overheads and administrative expenses.  Victim Support is now providing a wide range of specialist support services for crime victims.  I note also that it has taken steps to put in place a professional management structure in order to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness for the benefits of its clients.  In line with the Government's commitment to crime victims generally, the preparation of a comprehensive charter for crime victims is well under way in my Department at present and will be published early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The Government's determination to continue the fight against crime is reflected in the provision of £582 million for the Garda Vote for 1999.  This represents an increase of 18 per cent over the Estimates allocation for 1998.</P>
    <P>The provision includes funding to continue the Government's programme of accelerated Garda recruitment in order to bring the strength of the force to 12,000.  Since I have taken office as Minister, the strength of the force has increased to over 11,150, the highest level for over a decade.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved my proposals for a new Garda recruitment competition and it is envisaged that the Civil Service Commission will conduct the first phase &mdash; written tests &mdash; in late February or early March 1999.  In 1998, 550 trainees were recruited and the 1999 Estimate provides for recruitment of a further 550 next year.</P>
    <P>I recently obtained Government approval for the purchase of a second helicopter for use by the Garda air support unit.  The helicopter will, similar to the existing one, be piloted by the Air Corps with Garda observers and will act as a back-up to the existing helicopter which was designed and intended for use as an overt &ldquo;patrol car in the sky&rdquo; and has already proved extremely successful.  I have always supported the provision of all the equipment and technology necessary for <Col N="395" /> An Garda Síochána to do its job in an efficient and cost effective way.  This latest development represents another significant step forward in equipping the Garda in its fight against crime and demonstrates, once again, the determination of the Government in this regard.  Air support is a critical, tactical aid to any police force and the provision of a second helicopter will provide An Garda Síochána with additional air support capability in combating crime.</P>
    <P>I have also given clearance for the invitation of tenders to supply a boat to Garda specifications for a Garda water unit for deployment primarily on the Shannon waterway and estuary.  This patrol boat will provide a general policing service through patrolling, crime prevention, crime investigation support and security functions.</P>
    <P>Almost £22 million is provided in the Garda Vote next year towards the cost of developing Garda information technology systems.  Much of this money, approximately £14 million, will be expended on the implementation of the Garda IT strategy, or PULSE project, which seeks to replace many manual and paper based methods of Garda operations with state of the art computer systems which will streamline processes and result in significant operational benefits to the Garda Síochána.  The current phase of the PULSE project, the overall cost of which is approximately £44 million, is due for completion in August 2000 and many of the key systems will be rolled out to the force in 1999.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for the development of IT systems which need to be provided outside the PULSE project.  These niche systems will include a new &ldquo;fines on the spot&rdquo; system to reflect enhanced systems requirements under the Government's road safety policy.  Over £4 million has been provided for the purchase and maintenance of Garda communications equipment next year, reflecting the critical role that radio communications play in the operational requirements of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>A very significant investment has been made in improving Garda accommodation in recent years. Next year, more than £10 million is to be allocated to the building programme, £3.513 million of which is included in the Garda Vote for maintenance works, with the balance being provided in the Vote of the Office of Public Works from which the cost of major capital and refurbishment projects is met.</P>
    <P>A Garda SMI steering group was established in 1998 and charged with overseeing and examining the feasibility of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. The work of the steering group is supported by regular meetings of the bottom-up review group and by a full time implementation team.  I understand work is progressing well, that a detailed work programme extending to the end of 1999 has been agreed and that the steering <Col N="396" /> group will make its first report to Government in January 1999.</P>
    <P>In the relatively short time it has been in existence, the outstanding success of the Criminal Assets Bureau is evidence of what can be achieved when Government and statutory agencies put their heads together in a determined manner.  In the period from 15 October 1996 to 31 December 1996, the Criminal Assets Bureau obtained six interim orders for assets totalling in excess of £2 million and five interlocutory orders for assets totalling in excess of £2 million, while in 1997 the bureau obtained 12 interim orders for assets totalling in excess of £2 million and nine interlocutory orders for assets totalling in excess of £1.4 million.  In 1996-7 the Revenue officers of the Criminal Assets Bureau investigated, assessed and made demands for payment of tax, with interest, on persons suspected of criminal activity to the value of £8.6 million.  In the same period, the bureau also assessed social welfare overpayments and made social welfare savings to the value of £0.4 million.  For 1999, £4.012 million has been allocated to ensure the Criminal Assets Bureau can continue to operate as effectively as it has to date.</P>
    <P>As the House will, I hope, be aware I launched the report of the National Crime Forum on Monday last.  I have since arranged for copies of the report to be conveyed to each Member of the Dáil and Seanad.  As part of my commitment to the integrated services project I am pledging the full support of the Department, the Garda Síochána and the Probation and Welfare Service to the project.  As we know, the drugs problem is largely concentrated within communities which are characterised by large scale deprivation and marginalisation. The Government's resolve to tackle these problems is shown by the £30 million allocated to the young people's facilities and services fund which will be targeted at areas where there are high levels of social and economic disadvantage and where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to exist.  I intend to expand Garda special projects from 14 to 20.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problem of violence against women, the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women, which is chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will be holding a press conference tomorrow.  Suffice to say that violence within the home of any kind is an issue which deserves the highest priority, not only for the protection of the immediate victims but because of the long-term damage it causes to society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The House is well aware of the progress in building new prison spaces, and our commitment to the provision of an extra 2,000 places during the lifetime of this Government is being carried out.  The Estimates provide for the recruitment of some 600 additional prison staff.  The Estimate for the Probation and Welfare Service has been increased to £15.913 million in 1999.</P>
    <P>This year has seen possibly the biggest change in our courts system since the establishment of <Col N="397" /> the State, with the passing of the Courts Service Act, 1998.  The allocation to the courts has increased from £40.750 million in 1998 to £46.4 million in 1999.  A provision of £14.9 million has been made in 1999 for works to and maintenance of courthouses.</P>
    <P>The Government is providing over £17.4 million in the Estimates for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as environmental issues are concerned, I can safely say this is the best budget to date.  The increase in the financial support in this area clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to the protection of the environment and the promotion of the concept of sustainable development in a period of unprecedented economic growth.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased to welcome the provision, for the first time, of a specific allocation for the promotion of environmental awareness. We are now experiencing rapid economic growth and it is important that at such a time the concept of sustainable development is kept to the forefront in everyone's mind.  However, sustainable development must not be seen solely as the responsibility of the bigger players, such as industry, agriculture, etc.  In our daily lives each of us impacts on the environment in many ways through our modes of transport, use of water and energy resources, the goods we buy and the materials we use and ultimately discard.  We must, therefore, ensure the general public is aware of both the need to, and the ways in which they can, use resources in an eco-efficient and environmentally friendly way.</P>
      <P>The new provision of £500,000 is being allocated for the promotion of a broadly based campaign which will heighten public environmental awareness and emphasise what can be done through environmentally responsible public behaviour towards the achievement of sustainable development.  In addition, an extra £100,000 has been made available for my Department's environmental partnership fund.  This will double the fund to £200,000 in 1999, responding to a need we clearly identified this year.  The aim of the fund is to provide support for partnership projects between local authorities, community groups and NGOs, to raise awareness of environmental issues at local level.  This local involvement is, in my opinion, crucial to our success in this area, and it is very satisfying that there is a continuing high level of applications for assistance under the fund.  I am happy the increased funding will be well used at local level next year to meet an identified need for positive community action on the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Litter is an ongoing serious problem and I am determined to continue our efforts to underline its unacceptability.  An extra provision of £100,000 has been made available in the budget to continue my programme of anti-litter initiatives. <Col N="398" /> These include a national litter pollution monitoring system to assess and review local authority anti-litter operations and National Spring Clean 1999, a broad based partnership approach involving national and local government, An Taisce and major private sector companies as co-sponsors.  National Spring Clean will take place in April 1999 for the first time and will be an annual event thereafter.  On top of the extra provisions in the budget, the increase of £1.9 million in Exchequer support for the Environmental Protection Agency provided in the 1999 Estimates is most welcome.  Established in 1993, the agency is now a significant national organisation with staff based in five regional locations.  It provides much of the information and analytical support which we in Government need to define and develop policy and set priorities, and it has a key role to play in implementation.  The increase of 28 per cent in Exchequer support emphasises the Government's determination to continue the ongoing orderly build-up of EPA resources so that the agency is a strong and effective force for environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I recently published a major policy statement on waste management, Changing Our Ways, which seeks to facilitate a radical change in Irish waste management practices. Among other things, it sets out ambitious national targets for recovery and recycling of waste.  European Regional Development Fund funding is being provided for infrastructural development in the waste management area. Grant assistance approved between 1996 and 1998 exceeds £11.5 million, of which almost £5 million will be provided in 1999.  Assistance has been provided in respect of waste management strategy studies, waste recycling infrastructure and hazardous waste management facilities.</P>
    <P>I hope to see the many projects for which assistance has been already approved substantially brought to completion this year, with consequent benefits for strategic planning at local and national levels, and for our national recycling performance. I welcome these extra provisions in the budget, which will go a long way to heightening public awareness of environmental issues and reinforcing our efforts to promote and secure more environmentally friendly behaviour at all levels.</P>
    <P>I also thank the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, for their involvement in providing £500,000 for the Ridge project in Cork.  It is a unique project on the north side of Cork city in that it involves both the GAA and soccer associations in providing very necessary facilities for the young people of the area.  A lot of work has gone into ensuring this funding would be provided. The original source did not provide the funds but the Government provided them in the budget.  I pay tribute to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>This is a positive, targeted budget that has reached out to many in the community such as <Col N="399" /> the disabled and the educationally disadvantaged. I come from an area where there are huge problems and I am satisfied that we are going down the right road.  Over the next three years the Government will continue to tackle these areas and our performance will be the evidence for all to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Gerry Reynolds.</P>
      <P>No sooner has the party begun for low and middle income earners than it is over.  As soon as the Minister for Finance sat down after delivering his budget speech, I suspected this budget was an aberration.  What I did not expect was that my suspicions would be confirmed so soon.</P>
      <P>I was wrong.  Geraldine Kennedy's story in <i>The Irish Times</i> the following morning confirmed my worst suspicions.  She confirmed the Minister's intention to fulfil the Government's commitments on tax rates.  If these commitments are so important, and as Deputy McCreevy is so fond of stating, they are what won his party the election, why were they not pursued this year?  The bottom line is that it was not expedient to do so.</P>
      <P>One can imagine the scenario.  Early new year, not long after Deputy McCreevy's first budget, the Taoiseach, probably at one of his visits to open something somewhere in the country, stuck his finger in the air and decided the wind was not blowing in Deputy McCreevy's direction.  On this careful policy analysis the direction of this Government skidded to a halt and went into full scale reverse, for now at least, and only for now.</P>
      <P>Following Deputy McCreevy's remarks at his post-budget press conference, the Taoiseach came into the House last week to endorse his Minister's position.  He stated that high earners could look forward to future budgets under this Government.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the party is over for low income earners, but what kind of party was it?  It was more of a famine than a feast.  Despite the rhetoric from the Government side, the position is clear, and even the Taoiseach acknowledges it. He said this morning that benefits this year are more evenly spread, and he is right.  There has been no windfall for middle income earners. Middle income families have fared particularly badly.</P>
      <P>So too have the worst off in our society.  In their budget commentary the Conference of Religious in Ireland stated that the budget was poor on poverty.</P>
      <P>While this will probably fuel the ire felt by the Minister for Finance against the poverty industry, it remains a fact.  The Minister has no understanding of poverty.  He protests often that he had it hard in his day and I have no difficulty believing him.  Many people had it hard in 1960s Ireland, but the 1960s is no benchmark by which to judge today's poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my party colleague, Deputy Derek McDowell, stated trenchantly, poverty is relative.  It is <Col N="400" /> relative to the living standard enjoyed by others, to the life opportunities enjoyed by other people's children.  Poverty is not a measure of the availability of resources.  It is a measure of one's resources and opportunities as against those enjoyed by others in the same society.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this budget will increase poverty. The Taoiseach indicated that the 4 per cent increases in social welfare are above inflation. The INOU believes they represent a mere increase of 1.8 per cent.  These are considerably below the 7 per cent and 8 per cent increases in salaries revealed a couple of weeks ago, and which will have been increased further by yesterday's tax package.  The less well off, particularly those dependent on social welfare, will see the gap between them and their more fortunate neighbours increase as a result of this budget.</P>
    <P>The news this morning that the Minister for Public Enterprise is about to sanction increases in public transport costs in Dublin Bus, DART and suburban rail services is a further blow to those who are struggling to make ends meet on low incomes.  Public transport is often the only transport available to thousands of low income families and people relying on social welfare payments. A 10 per cent fare hike on public transport in Dublin will take a huge chunk out of the miserly £3 per week increase the Government chose to allocate to the long-term unemployed. This move will, in effect, ensure the most disadvantaged in society will be worse off after this budget.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech last week, I was struck by the fact that he is genuinely not aware of the opportunity he has let slip.  His speech was peppered with the economic language of the 1980s and bereft of the new priorities of the 1990s and the new millennium.  We have entered a new phase in Irish economic history. The opportunities we now have to build a modern pluralist and fair republic are without parallel in our history.  It is not difficult to see why a man like the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, obsessed with the problems of the 1980s, does not see why banking a budget surplus of £1 billion is not in the long-term interests of this nation.</P>
    <P>Debt, like poverty, is relative.  It is relative to one's capacity to repay it.  There are two things which reduce problems associated with debt, inflation and economic growth.  I would have been happy to see the Minister return an overall surplus for the year.  However, I question its size. In my view we would be better off investing that money in our overall productive capacity.  Roads, transport and labour are where our priorities should lie.  They are the key to ensuring sustainable non-inflationary growth, the same growth a future Minister &mdash; certainly not this one &mdash; would use to create a fairer and more equal republic.</P>
    <P>That growth is being put at risk by a Government and Minister unable to see beyond their noses and the short-term party political issues of the day.  The inability to see beyond the short <Col N="401" /> term and to address the long-term issues is the defining factor of this Government.  As my colleague, Deputy McDowell, pointed out in his contribution last week, the Government's current approach to the regionalisation issue and Structural Funds will damage the interests this Government purports to represent.</P>
    <P>This is hardly surprising.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment also contributed to this debate and, as ever, she did not allow consistency to get in the way of a good sell.  Thankfully, all her cannons were aimed in the Labour Party's direction.  We are obviously doing something right.  It is interesting that the Government, which believes the proposed Labour Party-DL merger will have no effect, has spent considerable energy saying so.  I wonder if the threat from the Left has already had an impact, albeit in the decision of the Government to rein in the natural tendencies of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's instincts, however, are more base.  They are about survival and the less said about that uphill battle for her and her colleagues the better.  I use the word &ldquo;colleagues&rdquo; advisedly. It looks at this stage that she has identified the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, as a threat to her throne.  In fairness, her solution has been swift as she hung Deputy O'Donnell, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development aid, out to dry &mdash; so much for PD solidarity.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste was full of bravado about her achievements.  A footballer can be judged only on the amount of possession he receives.  The Tánaiste's bravado falls flat based on this criterion, as ably illustrated by Deputy John Bruton.  Taken together, the Government's two budgets have targeted resources unashamedly at the well off.  The difference between the Tánaiste and her former colleague, Michael McDowell, is that he would, at least, have had the courage to say so.  She knows the package announced by the Labour Party in its pre-budget submission on 29 November was a great deal more radical than the package announced.  She might also recall that after her efforts at tax reform last year more people paid at the higher rate than prior to that budget.</P>
    <P>The current labour shortage and the resultant demand for the participation of women in the workforce has at last brought the debate on child care centre stage.  In advance of the budget it was made clear that investment in child care was crucial in terms of maintaining our economic success. For the first time in a long time employers, trade unions and voluntary organisations were singing from the same hymn book.  However, no matter how loud they sang, it seems the Government was not listening.</P>
    <P>The only provision to stimulate the supply side of child care are concessions to the private sector to invest in child care facilities.  How will this measure impact on poverty in the context of the national anti-poverty strategy?  How will this measure alone make child care more accessible <Col N="402" /> and affordable for thousands of cash strapped parents?</P>
    <P>In recent years budget debates have concentrated on tax reform measures.  Given the huge additional revenue available to the Minister for Finance, he had the opportunity to make a real and substantial difference to the lives of thousands of families which have been neglected and denied sufficient State resources for too long.</P>
    <P>Prior to the budget, Opposition parties made the argument during a number of debates in Private Members' Time that £80 million was needed this year in the current economic boom. However, on budget day the increased funding necessary to ensure people with mental and physical disabilities were not left behind came nowhere near this target figure.  I am dismayed that, at a time of unprecedented economic growth, the Government did not treat this issue as a priority and use the budget to bring services up to an acceptable standard.  This represents a huge missed opportunity by the Government and the Minister at a time of buoyant revenue returns. However, he can introduce a number of measures in the Finance Bill which would bring some comfort to people with disabilities and I ask him to give serious consideration of these.</P>
    <P>I welcome his decision to restructure VRT on cars.  Favouring small cars is a positive environmental tax measure, one of the few in the budget. Despite the kite-flying exercise in the lead-up to the budget by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, little more was done in the form of environmental taxes.  This was a mistake and the Minister for Finance made no effort in this year's budget to expand the tax base.  A recent series of articles in a national newspaper drew attention to the fact that, despite the common perception, Ireland is a low tax country compared with its European neighbours.  The fault with our tax system is that such a large amount of tax revenue is taken from the PAYE sector. Unless the tax base is broadened, this problem will continue to plague ordinary workers.  If in future years taxes have to be increased due to a downturn in economic activity, the PAYE sector will have to pay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extra funding the Minister has allocated to the increase in the disabled person's allowance.  An extra provision of £3 million is a positive development.  However, I still have grave reservations about the manner in which this grant is administered.  Up to 75 per cent of the cost of renovations is provided under the grant, the disabled person has to cover 25 per cent of the cost. Health boards are reluctant to cover this extra cost and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people with disabilities who cannot carry out the renovations needed to their houses to make their lives more comfortable.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why the Minister did not provide the extra finance necessary to cover that during the current economic boom.  There is no point in the Minister for the Environment and Local Government stating in a reply to a parliamentary <Col N="403" /> question which I tabled that he is considering it as a millennium project.  Such a project will happen down the road, but people will suffer in the meantime.  I have come across numerous cases where severely handicapped people use outdoor toilets because they cannot supplement the funding available under the welfare system.  It is crazy that this problem has not been wiped out in the budget.</P>
    <P>Is it time we considered providing 100 per cent of the cost of renovating houses?  People with disabilities are excluded from many work opportunities and it is extremely difficult for any person surviving on a social welfare payment to come up with the 25 per cent additional cost involved.  Is it right that people with disabilities must always rely on friends and family to help them out financially? Is it right that at a time of unprecedented economic growth we are still prepared to see people with disabilities relying on charity to achieve a basic standard of living?  I urge the Minister to review this matter during consideration of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the difficulties being faced by a group concerned with people who suffer from attention disorder deficit.  There is very little known about this ailment, which affects hundreds of people throughout the country.  Recently, a support group was formed which seeks to provide support and solidarity to sufferers and their families. A help line is among the voluntary services provided by this group and it is a vital link for sufferers and their families.  Despite repeated attempts, this group has failed to secure a meeting with the Eastern Health Board to discuss its services and future funding requirements.  Perhaps the Minister will consider providing interim funding, which would be a relatively small amount, to assist this group in the coming year.</P>
    <P>This is a disappointing budget.  The Minister was in a unique position.  His budget cannot be compared with other budgets simply because this year we entered a new phase in our economic history. Unfortunately, the Minister failed to institute a new era in our social history.  Poverty, disadvantage and unemployment will still remain huge social problems.  The extra funding provided for health and education in the budget does not represent an all-out assault on inequality.  Given the budget surplus and the future surpluses the Minister can count on in the coming years, there is an unprecedented opportunity to transform society.  The opportunity to start this process was not taken this year.  If the words of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are to be believed, the progressive elements of the budget will grind to a halt next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, the sixth or seventh time I have participated in such a debate. This budget was unique in that the budget surplus was so great the Government had an historic opportunity to fund progress and development <Col N="404" /> into the 21st century.  To oppose for the sake of it is not always a good form of politics.  The Minister for Finance had the opportunity to introduce a good budget with the largest surplus in the history of the State.  He got some things right &mdash; I compliment him for giving tax breaks to the lower paid.  This is a change from the tax policies proposed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats during the last election campaign to those put forward by Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left in the Rainbow Government.  It is not the first time Fianna Fáil has done a U-turn in Government and it will not be the last, but we should remember it will benefit many of the people they represent.  It will not solve all problems but it is a move in the right direction.  The move towards tax credits is good, it is how tax policy should evolve over the next few years, and I compliment the Minister on starting that process, even though it will come about more slowly than my party and I would like.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on keeping one eye on reducing the national debt.  I was educated in the 1970s so I know the economic significance of the growth of that debt.  Now that we have good economic returns it is extremely important that we reduce the debt, because no other generation should suffer as mine did as a result of bad economic policies.  Most of my classmates, and those I grew up with had no option after their education but to leave the country to look for work.  Emigration may be part of what we are but it should not rob rural communities of their young people.  Much of it was a result of bad economic management by all parties.  Now that the economy is in a good state we should not hang a rope around our necks by allowing the national debt to grow.  Debt reduction may have more to do with lower interest rates than any policy pursued by this Government, but it is one of the most important aspects of our economy.  I compliment the Minister on the reduction; perhaps it could have been reduced further but he is moving in the right direction.</P>
      <P>However, in a number of areas the Minister failed to take advantage of the opportunities presented to him.  When I was a college student Deputy McCreevy was an outspoken Fianna Fáil backbencher who built his political reputation on financial rectitude.  He had the greatest and easiest chance of any Minister for Finance to introduce such a policy, but he did not take it.  I am amazed at this, because even when he was Opposition spokesman on Finance he was of the view that the biggest issue affecting the economy was public service pay, yet he has ignored this, as have all parties and politicians.  If political parties do not have the courage to tackle the issue of public service pay it will be very difficult to put in place proper economic structures to take us into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has 250,000 civil servants administering the Departments for a population of less than four million while in Brussels, which is deemed to be the home of bureaucracy, there are 80,000 <Col N="405" /> people to administer the affairs of the EU, which has a population of 250 million.  Ireland has almost 200,000 more administrators than the EU, which is an amazing statistic in itself.</P>
    <P>There are proposals to make the Eastern Health Board more consumer friendly; I will have an opportunity later to speak on that legislation. In 1970, there were 95 officials to administer the affairs of that health board.  There have been many changes in our health services since then, and many new services have been introduced, but the EHB now has between 7,000 and 7,500 administrators.  This is why we have difficulties with hospital waiting lists.  I would like to know how much the Department of Health and Children spends on administration, particularly in the EHB region.  There are proposals to set up a further three councils, with a further 2,000 administrators.</P>
    <P>This country is being lost in bureaucracy, which is frightening for many people who have to deal with it on a regular basis.  As practising politicians we have difficulties with bureaucracy and know what we have to do to get around it.  I do not know if any political party has the courage to tackle the issue of public sector pay.  I accept that many officials in the public service have done tremendous work but we do not need as many as we currently have.</P>
    <P>Every day we hear the private sector cannot recruit staff because there are no workers available for the service and computer sectors, among others.  In the 1970s there was no economic growth and many young people were taken into the public service because there was no one else to provide employment, but the position has changed dramatically &mdash; and there are plenty of vacancies in the private sector.  Now is the time for the Government to consider a public sector embargo.  A number of years ago the former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry received much credit for imposing an embargo; it lasted for a year but the numbers grew by 100,000 shortly after.  In many cases, the same job opportunities are arising in the private sector as in the public sector, so people who want to join the public sector have a choice.  The Government should impose an embargo to solve the problem once and for all.  It will not be solved in a year or two, a programme is required, but this Minister, who based his reputation on financial rectitude, does not appear to have the courage to go down that road.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the introduction of an environmental aspect to vehicle registration tax. I presume a bright individual in the Department of Finance said £45 million was needed and such a tax was the way to get it.  That is fine and it will raise that amount.  However, although I do not wish to create an urban-rural divide, it will hit rural people more than urban people.  Many people in rural Ireland drive diesel cars and a 1.9 cc diesel car is similar to a 1.4 cc petrol car.  However, a person will pay an extra £600 or £700 for a diesel <Col N="406" /> car.  This is an unfair tax.  Taxation is supposed to be equitable and the changes to VRT were not thought out fully.  This tax will hit many vulnerable people who need their cars for business and those in the agricultural sector.  The implications of the tax in rural economies were not properly considered and I hope the Minister will drop the changes in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>A sum of £10 million has been provided for the farmers' dole.  It was stated that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs when assessing applicants will lay down different guidelines. However, farmers who are experiencing the worst crisis since the State was founded do not want handouts.  They want a policy put in place which will allow them to survive in agriculture and continue in the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed.  The introduction of a £10 million dole scheme implies that the Government has decided that it cannot help farmers any other way and it will give them a handout.</P>
    <P>Farmers in every county are facing the greatest crisis they have ever experienced and the £10 million will not be available until the middle of next year.  The provision shows that the Government is totally out of touch with what is happening on the ground.  Unfortunately, it is another example of the inconsistency of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.  He has allowed every other Minister at the Cabinet table to take more money for their Departments. He is ineffectual and has caused much of the crisis.  The farming organisations and farming community have no confidence in him.  The £10 million for farmers' dole is a paltry amount which will not solve the problem.  It is a very short-term solution which will not resolve the crisis facing agriculture and farm families in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced the rural renewal pilot scheme for Leitrim and parts of Sligo and Longford in last year's budget.  However, it still has not been sanctioned.  Many entrepreneurs are waiting for the Government to give the go ahead to the scheme.  I hope the Minister will deal with this matter in the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>I warmly congratulate the Minister for Finance on the budget for 1999.  All Members on this side will make a similar opening statement but I can justify it by mentioning a number of issues which are of concern to me, particularly arising from my membership of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion and drugs, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, and my other areas of responsibility including local development and the drugs initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social inclusion measures in the budget <Col N="407" /> amount to a total of £287.5 million in a full year. This is a considerable sum which is spread over a number of various Departments and agencies.  It brings together the outcome of our discussions at the Cabinet sub-committee where all the members, at the behest of the Taoiseach, try to focus their efforts on the issue of social inclusion and dealing with the underlying causes of social exclusion.  I am pleased that as a member of the sub-committee I found it possible to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>This is why I suggest this is a good budget which seeks to tackle in a special way issues concerning social exclusion.  In projecting my mind forward to the remaining lifetime of this Government and the next three budgets, I hope at that stage that circumstances collectively will have changed considerably for those suffering at present from social exclusion.  The budget is a significant step on the path to improving the lot of those in our community who have for too long been disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline a number of particular examples because Members may not have picked up on some of the provisions contained in the budget.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance for providing the relatively small sum of £300,000 to the Parish of the Traveller Community group for the purpose of empowering travellers, particularly in the communications area.  This is an important step for the Parish of the Traveller Community because, as Members are aware, the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, which was introduced by the Government, was enacted in September.  It has the potential to make a significant contribution towards the important issue of the provision of proper accommodation and facilities which has bedevilled the traveller community for many years.</P>
    <P>The communications initiative which will be undertaken by the Parish of the Traveller Community will make a considerable contribution towards empowering travellers to speak up for themselves at meetings in public fora, in their participation in special traveller sub-committees of local authorities and through their involvement with traveller support groups.  This is only one example of the caring aspect of the Government's approach as enunciated by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is most concerned about making a difference in areas of social exclusion, particularly in the urban blackspots which have existed for too many years.  Despite the efforts of statutory agencies, they have continued to slip behind. This is why I was particularly pleased that the integrated services project, which was brought forward through the local development committee which I chair, received approval from the Cabinet sub-committee.  It was launched last Friday by the Taoiseach.  The ultimate aim of the project is to develop models to secure more effective use of the State's resources in deprived urban <Col N="408" /> areas generally and thereby improve the overall quality of life of the communities in those areas.</P>
    <P>The initial focus of the pilot project is on four small target areas.  Funding for the project was provided in last year's budget.  The first phase of the project was a research base which involved a close look at the situation in four areas: Dublin north east inner city; the canal communities, including Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's Estate and Dolphin House; Jobstown, Tallaght and Toher in Cork.  The situation on the ground suggests the value of closer working and planning relationships between the organisations from the State funded sector in deprived urban areas.  It also indicates the value of taking account of the real needs and experience of end users in the design and planning of service deliveries in those areas.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the successful implementation of the project the Cabinet subcommittee decided to put in place a comprehensive system of accountability and reporting at national level.  It also laid down a number of specific principles which will inform the implementation of the project in the target areas.  The implementation phase was launched, following discussions at a special meeting of Secretary Generals of the relevant Departments and chief executive officers of relevant agencies, by the Taoiseach on 4 December.  The Taoiseach availed of the opportunity to speak frankly to the senior civil servants and representatives of the State agencies and asked the administrators for their wholehearted commitment to the project.</P>
    <P>If this project is to work it needs a comprehensive support network.  The first element is political commitment at the highest level.  That commitment is evidenced by the Cabinet subcommittee's decision and the launch by the Taoiseach of the implementation phase.  The project also requires one centre of political responsibility. The Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion has decided that as Minister of State with responsibility for local development, I would be responsible for the overall implementation of the project.  I will be responsible for making this project happen and can call on others to account as the need arises.  I will be responsible also for monitoring its progress and reporting regularly to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that a project such as this cannot succeed unless it has commitment at the highest level within the public service.  I was heartened by the open and positive response of the senior public servants at last Friday's launch.  The Cabinet subcommittee decided that each relevant Department or agency should designate one person at national and local level to be responsible for ensuring the integrated services project process is put in place in that organisation.  Those designated nationally and locally will be accountable and I am free to contact them at any time about progress or blockages.</P>
    <P>We will need some independent operational <Col N="409" /> support to activate and monitor the project at local level.  We have already advertised for four development and monitoring officers, one for each of the four target areas.  These people will be employed, perhaps on secondment, to drive the implementation phase in the target areas.  It is likely they will be employed by ADM which has already done a superb job in delivering the first phase of the project.</P>
    <P>The project is the child of the local development committee.  At the outset the committee appointed a small steering group from its members to bring the project forward.  This group, which is chaired by my Department, will keep in close touch with developments and will be assisted by ADM.</P>
    <P>The reporting and accountability framework which I have outlined was suggested by the work done in the target areas and subsequent discussions. It was also informed by the experience of a number of initiatives in the past which have sought to tackle the problems of urban disadvantage in a more co-ordinated way.  We are taking this concerted approach, to identify principles and best practice from the work in these pilot areas, which will guide their application in a broader response to service deliveries in other areas of deprivation.  We have to move towards a more co-ordinated approach to service delivery.</P>
    <P>Greater information sharing and pooling of experience will be needed in the planning and design of services.  In short, a more team like approach will be needed.  In addition to a more structured and sustained dialogue between service providers, it is desirable that the planning, design and delivery of services take the real experience, needs and priorities of end users into account.  If integrated service delivery is to become a reality, it must be accepted as a normal part of the work and ethos of every Department and agency.  This is a critical issue.  Moving towards a more co-ordinated and integrated way of doing things must be recognised as a normal part of the ethos of every relevant organisation.</P>
    <P>Staff should not be penalised for taking the time to develop more integrated solutions. Developing integrated services will place demands on staff time, whether time for consultation with end users or with other service providers. Staff should not be penalised when staff performance is being assessed but regard should be had to the extent to which they had participated in or developed more co-ordinated solutions to the problem confronting them.  While this may be obvious it is standing organisational tradition on its head and is, therefore, an issue which might be usefully addressed in the wider strategic management debate.</P>
    <P>There are pockets of intense disadvantage in urban areas, many of which have been there for a while.  Despite the efforts of individual organisations and successive administrations problems still exist.  This is not a criticism of specific individuals or organisations.  It is simply a reflection of the systems failure.  This is not unique to Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> It tends to happen whenever different organisations work in the same area addressing different but related problems.  The integrated services project is not a grants programme.  It is focused on the overall process of delivery of State services in these areas rather than on the administration of <i>ad hoc</i> solutions.  It is not an abstract or theoretical exercise.  It is a pilot project focused on the needs of real communities.  Following the launch by the Taoiseach on Friday last, all relevant Departments and agencies are committed to considering, as a matter of urgency, the possibility of a number of practical actions which might be taken in these areas to kick start the process.</P>
    <P>This is another example of the Government's attempt to tackle social exclusion wherever it exists.  The budget makes a significant contribution towards tackling social exclusion which all of us ought to support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on getting the budget right.  Its overall strategy was excellent.  It is a prudent and common sense budget.  He gave back plenty of the money collected but did not go too far.  He wanted to ensure we did not revert to the problems of 1987.  It was creative and well targeted towards social inclusion and equity, particularly in the tax system.</P>
      <P>The tax reliefs will take 80,000 people out of the tax net.  For the first time it means that those on £100 per week will not pay income tax.  The change to tax credits will ensure the tax free allowance is the same for everyone.  In the two budgets for which the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, was responsible, the tax changes amount to a radical reform of the tax system towards social inclusion.</P>
      <P>I compliment also my colleague from the neighbouring constituency, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, for the caring and imaginative improvements he has introduced.  We all recognise the debt of gratitude we owe to the elderly given that we now have the highest standard of living ever experienced here.  This is due in no small measure to the work of the previous generation and those who are now enjoying their retirement.  It is in order to compliment the Minister on providing £6 per week for old age pensioners. That, added to the £5 last year, brings us well on the way to the commitment prior to the election that pensions would be £100 by the time the Government is five years in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the carer's allowance there are important changes.  The disregards for the carer's are important and will make life easier for them.  In a future budget perhaps the Minister will look at the level of dependency given that some carers are looking after relatives who are totally dependant.  Generally this work is done by a wife whose husband may be on a a salary of £15,000. In that case they do not qualify for a carer's allowance.  There is a case to be made for providing carer's allowances in cases of total dependency <Col N="411" /> where a carer has to remain in the house and attend to their every need.</P>
    <P>The new farmers allowance is imaginative and will be welcomed.  The fact £100 will be disregarded for the first two children and £200 for subsequent children and that remaining income will be assessed at 80 per cent will mean many smaller farmers who experience financial difficulties will benefit.  I welcome the improvements in agriculture, both in the budget and the Estimates. I welcome the £11 million allocation towards VAT rebate, the provision for stock relief, the reintroduction of the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene scheme.  I also welcome the expedition of payments to farmers, which is particularly important when they are experiencing difficulties because of the crisis in Russia and bad weather here.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the time and effort expended by the Minister to address the serious situation in regard to pig producers, particularly those in the Border region.  The Minister has held a number of meetings with pig producers in recent weeks. He visited Cavan last Friday where he met with pig producers and visited McCarron's bacon factory. He also met with bankers and millers today to see how the situation might be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the context of Agenda 2000, it is important positive rural policies are developed.  I am glad the Government is working on that.  I would be concerned that although there has been a policy of decentralisation by successive Governments at central level, in the counties there appears to be a policy of centralisation towards the county town. That must be addressed to allow all towns to develop and to ensure we maintain as many people as possible in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Education has benefited greatly from the budget.  The £57 million announced for 1999-2000 is to be welcomed.  The Taoiseach and the Government recognise the value and importance of education in terms of people's individual benefit and the contribution it makes to economic development.  We have an excellent education system in this country although there is always need for improvement.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, will go down in history, together with Donogh O'Malley and Pádraig Faulkner, who introduced Regional Technical Colleges, as a very innovative Minister. He has made a tremendous contribution in his two years in office, particularly in the area of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Business, particularly smaller businesses, will benefit from the budget.  It is encouraging to see corporation tax being reduced from 32 per cent to 28 per cent, in the direction of the 12.5 per cent level promised for a few years' time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the imposition of excise duty on cigarettes.  If I have one criticism of the Minister, it would be that he did not go far enough in this regard.  A sum of 5p per packet is not nearly enough when one considers the effects of tobacco on people's health.  Smoking contributes to 5,000 <Col N="412" /> deaths annually and 15,000 people are hospitalised annually from smoking-related illnesses. People must be made aware of the dangers of tobacco.</P>
    <P>The massive increase in the health allocation is to be welcomed.  It must be a matter of concern to everyone that there is no end in sight to the demand for more money in the health area.  It is important the Minister maintains a balance between community care, mental handicap and the insatiable appetite for funding of acute hospitals.  That raises the question of value for money and the type of management required in our acute hospitals.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a major growth area.  I would be concerned that counties which do not have a tourism tradition, such as my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, will not benefit to the same extent as others.  I am aware the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is very familiar with the Border region.  However, if five million people arrived in Ireland tomorrow, how would he channel 1 per cent of them to Cavan and Monaghan? We must ensure that tourism, which will be a major growth area into the next century, will benefit all areas of the country.</P>
    <P>The budget is targeted at social inclusion and huge resources have been allocated to achieve that.  I would question whether it is only money which is required to achieve social inclusion.  In many instances, I do not believe money is necessary to improve the lot of people on the margins. The day of evictions for non-payment of rent should be long gone.  A total of 82.5 per cent of local authority tenants are dependent on social welfare payments.  The social welfare payments scheme to local authorities should be implemented across the board to prevent evictions occurring.  I would also consider the issue of lone parents, particularly where a wife is deserted by her husband.  It is unreasonable to ask a woman with young children to pursue her husband, perhaps even abroad, before she is paid the lone parent's allowance.  I am aware of the abuses which could occur but such an imposition should not be made on a woman in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>This is a very good budget.  If the Government proceeds in this manner in its next three budgets, it will change the face of this country for the better and beyond our dreams.</P>

The number of changes made in regard to spending is encouraging.  I would hope that over the next number of budgets we will see further significant and positive changes.</P>

    <P>I want to refer to education.  It is said that the devil is in the detail, and I hope the figures outlined filter down in a positive and constructive way to all constituencies.  Not only are we here to pass a budget which will impact nationally and drive the economy forward in a positive manner, <Col N="413" /> we must also ensure every constituency adheres to the national trend of growth, stability and economic progress.</P>
    <P>I made a case in the past for the development of an outreach centre in Kilkenny in conjunction with the NUI, Maynooth, the Carlow Institute of Technology and St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny. The centre will allow those who did not access third level education at a young age to return to education and access it on their own doorstep.  A project of this nature represents value for money for the Department which spent £11 million in the Carlow Institute of Technology and a good deal more in NUI, Maynooth.  The development of the project in Kilkenny is proof we can obtain value for money and the existence of the outreach centre prevents people being attracted to larger urban centres.  The centre is up and running and the potential exists for it to improve and expand. It is expected that 200 to 300 students will attend the centre in the next few years.  The project has arisen from a local initiative using local funding. I urge the Minister to consider the possibility of a pilot scheme for the project.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the development of rural Ireland and the crisis in farming.  There is a social crisis.  Young people find it extremely difficult to secure planning permission while the main players in the local economy are moving to urban centres.  Rural communities are dying as a result.  Moves have been made to encourage young people to remain on the land.  To this end county enterprise boards should be assisted to fund agricultural development.  Money has been set aside for water and sewerage schemes.  I hope Graiguenamanagh, Kilmacow and Thomastown in County Kilkenny will be included.  Young people would not move to urban centres if they could build houses in their own communities.  The same principle applies in the area of education.</P>
    <P>It appears every service in the south-east region is being relocated to Waterford.  The hospital in Kilcreene is being closed while many services in St. Luke's Hospital are being scaled down.  This has led to a demand for better roads in Waterford to allow easier access.  The Minister should consider the hospital plan submitted.  If permission was granted to sell two plots of land in Kilkenny, money would be available to fund the development of services in St. Luke's Hospital where the Minister has invested in a psychiatric unit.  Funding should be provided for an old people's home and an outreach centre where patients can recuperate following an operation.</P>
    <P>The approach roads from Carlow and Kilkenny to Belview port are inadequate and should be improved to allow easier access.</P>

      <P>The 1999 budget is a budget of <Col N="414" /> contrasts, good for some but bad for others.  It is good on income tax reform but bad on tackling poverty.  The income tax system will be fairer as a result.  More resources will be available to the elderly and the number entitled to claim carer's allowance will increase.  There will not be a significant reduction, however, in the number living in poverty while hospital waiting lists, local authority housing lists, adult illiteracy and rural exclusion will remain untackled.</P>
      <P>There is an extraordinary failure to understand the plight of those on social welfare.  There is, however, a great understanding of the plight of the bookie whose clients are succumbing to the lure of offshore tax free telephone betting.</P>
      <P>The low-paid and pensioners are only worth an extra £6 a week.  The qualifying age for old age pension has not been reduced since it was reduced in consecutive years from 70 to 66 by Dr. Garret Fitzgerald.  It was envisaged that it would be reduced to 65.  There is a general increase of a miserable £3 a week.  This is the equivalent of 45p a day.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is to be increased by £3 a month or 10p a day in respect of the first and second child and £4 or 16p a day in respect of subsequent children.  It would not buy a lollipop.

The increases in unemployment assistance, adult allowances, maternity and adoptive benefit and family income supplement will not be paid until June.  I hope he will rectify this and listen to what I have to say.  He should not cod the public.  What is he budgeting for?  Some provisions will not come into effect for a number of months, yet tax increases were implemented on the night of the budget.  A packet of 20 cigarettes was increased by 5p.  In addition, the increase in VRT will soon reduce the cars on the road to cocoa tins because nobody will be able to afford to buy decent cars. The fatal crashes which occur would not happen if there were good, solid and sound vehicles on the road.  Does the Minister not realise that his measure will add to the numbers killed on the roads in the coming years?</P>

    <P>Deputy McGuinness said this was a good budget for getting young people to return to the land.  Who is he codding?  Everybody knows that application rates to agricultural colleges throughout the country have dropped considerably and <Col N="415" /> that the youth have no interest in taking up farming because there is no future in it.  At a presentation in west Cork a year ago last June, the Minister said that he would not be in office four months before he would reintroduce the farm installation grants.  He is now 20 months in power and this has not happened.</P>
    <P>No farmer, farming community or farming body I know of was popping champagne corks on the night of the budget because they had nothing to be thankful for.  This was a dull, dreary budget as far as the farming community is concerned.</P>

      <P>There are applications for water and sewerage schemes from my county council in Cork lying dormant in the Minister's office for the past 15 years.  They are now accumulating dust, yet no progress has been made on giving them clearance because the Minister only caters for constituencies which are of special concern to him and which are probably represented by Independent Deputies who will prop up the Government because of the kudos they get.  However, one, two or five constituencies does not make a country and the Minister will have to explain his conduct to the rest of the public.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made when he is preparing the Finance Bill.  I ask him to increase the benefits allocated to the poor, unfortunate and underprivileged and to at least bring them forward to 1 April.  I see no reason they could not be brought forward to 1 January.  If he had so much money to give away why did he not put it where his mouth should be?  I cannot understand why he is delaying the payment of these increases by nine months.  It is a deplorable attitude for a Minister for Finance and a Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to adopt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the economic buoyancy, there has never been greater expectations of a budget.  The surplus of more than £1 billion did not come about by accident.  Tribute should be paid to the previous Government for ensuring that the economy progressed so well.  In view of the buoyancy it has been possible to introduce a tax credit system, which my party has advocated over a considerable period of time but which needed the kind of funding that is now available. I welcome that as a positive move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on the social welfare points made by the previous speaker.  However, <Col N="416" /> the increase in benefits by 3 per cent is not compatible with the kind of economy that is in place. While many people have returned to work recently many others are unemployed and still cannot get jobs.  Many on the liver register have literacy problems.  Attempts are made to get them on community employment projects or training courses, yet the most fundamental skill they require is the ability to read and write.</P>
    <P>It would be worth analysing this cohort of people to ascertain the numbers who have difficulties in this area.  Even if special training programmes have to be funded they should be provided to give them the ability to read and write. This would improve their job chances enormously. There is a tendency in many cases for them to drift into schemes, return to them the following and subsequent years and then end up on the live register again.  We often massage the figures by taking people off the liver register only to push them back onto it again.  If the Government addressed this issue positive benefits would follow.</P>
    <P>Many motorists, especially owners of family saloons, will be bitterly disappointed with the provisions on VRT.  The SIMI organised extensive lobbying around the country and we were all invited to meetings.  I attended a meeting in Limerick and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, was thanked for taking time from his busy schedule to meet the organisation.  I am sure it was happy and confident that, with the Celtic tiger roaring, it would win concessions such as a reduction in VRT.</P>
    <P>The reaction of the SIMI to the budget was understandable.  When we entered the Common Market there was an anticipation that car prices would fall.  Those of us who have followed the English tabloids over the weekend and see the cars available in the UK will be envious, especially when the prices are compared with those prevailing in this country.  While tax credits may be provided, many people must travel to work by car.  Those who made an order to take delivery of a car next January were probably bitterly disappointed when garages requested an extra £600 in view of the changes announced in the budget.  I anticipate that the SIMI will engage in intensive lobbying prior to the Finance Act. The matter should be addressed because I find it difficult to reconcile it with the decision by the Minister to reduce betting taxes.  References were made to telephone betting, betting on the Isle of Man and the need to save charges.  However, the Minister's decision was regressive and contrasts with the VRT provisions.</P>
    <P>Provision was made regarding water and sewerage schemes for small villages and towns. Previous speakers were correct in saying all Members could speak about specific sewerage schemes needed in the rural communities they represent.  Leader funding and other appropriate funding under community employment schemes and so on often create a buzz in a community. <Col N="417" /> Footpaths may be widened and trees planted, but improvement works in respect of a sewerage scheme is often the most fundamental project required to bring life and vibrancy back to a community. We often put the cart before the horse in this regard.  The provision of or improvement works in respect of a sewerage scheme is often the most important project required when one talks about building a primary school and houses. With the £50 million that has been allocated for this, I hope that over the next few years we can provide the necessary sewerage schemes.  The Government should focus on providing such schemes in the counties which it is projected will not be eligible for Objective One status after 2000.  That would be something positive in that direction.</P>
    <P>The people in the constituency I represent are extremely bitter about the position regarding Objective One status.  My constituency is contiguous to Kerry and Clare, but it has been precluded from the group of counties for which Objective One status is being sought.  I hope a proposal will be put forward by my council to ensure that under its development plan, the county, which has been unfairly excluded from the counties for which Objective One status is being sought, will be given extra support.  I refer to a type of urban taxation package.  The Shannon scheme was referred to earlier and I understand the Minister is seeking EU sanction for a scheme.  If he were to broaden such a scheme, he should consider Limerick West as a natural constituency for inclusion.</P>
    <P>Members have dwelt on the position of farmers. Many farmers in parts of Limerick West were eligible to claim under the fodder scheme.  During the summer months I and other Members visited many of the farms affected and saw at first hand the difficulties experienced by them.  Many farmers, some of whom had suffered damage and fodder loss in excess of £1,000, were disappointed that the maximum funding available under the scheme was £300.  However, that decision has been made and we cannot change it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate it is not proposed to introduce a farm assist scheme until next June.  Given the difficulties farmers are experiencing, many of them may be driven out of farming by that time. If a cohort of approximately 8,000 farmers currently avail of the farmers' dole, it is anticipated that up to 14,000 farmers would be eligible to claim it.  A recent study undertaken by Dr. Jim Phelan identified that more than 70,000 farmers earn less than £156 per week.  It is worth bearing that figure in mind because it will have serious implications in regard to whether farmers will decide to stay on the land.  If we have a current crisis in farming, a mechanism to address it should be put in place quickly.  The means of farmers should be investigated and if they are entitled to additional funding which will be available next year, such funding should be provided now when it is urgently required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  I, like my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, who represents Cavan-Monaghan, welcome the budget, though probably for different reasons.  Its provisions will do something to help people on low and middle incomes, which my party suggested was the right way to proceed. That is especially welcome in an area like Cavan-Monaghan where many people are employed in the furniture and fruit industries.  Workers in those industries are not as highly paid as those in hi-tech industry.  They will welcome the move in the budget to increase personal allowances and improve the income tax bases.  In last year's budget a person on an average wage got an increase of £2.50 while a person earning £55,000 got an increase of £12.50, but the balance has been redressed this year, and that is welcome.</P>
      <P>However this year's budget has increased the discrimination in the tax system against the self-employed and farmers.  A single PAYE worker can earn £100 tax free, but a person who is self-employed, such as a carpenter, electrician, shopkeeper or farmer, can only earn £80.77 tax free. A married PAYE worker whose spouse does not work outside the home can earn £180.77 tax free, but if that person was self-employed he could only earn £161 tax free.  That is a significant loss for thousands of people in Cavan-Monaghan who, traditionally, have been enterprising and self-employed.  This discrimination in the tax system should be eliminated immediately as it is stifling and unfair to the self-employed.</P>
      <P>The rural and urban renewal schemes were announced in last year's budget, but they have not been implemented.  I welcome the commitment given by the Minister here last Wednesday to do something about that and to bring forward the introduction of those schemes or at least the rural renewal scheme.  Even more than that, I welcome his preparedness to extend those schemes.  It is essential such schemes are extended to include areas such as Cavan-Monaghan and the Border counties which have suffered significantly from the Troubles during the last 30 years. I welcome the move in that direction.</P>
      <P>The increase of £6 in the old age pension and £3 in respect of a spouse or partner is welcome, but how can the Minister explain to those with a disability or in receipt of invalidity benefit why in the last two budgets he has discriminated against them?  A person with a disability will only get an increase of £3, while an old age pensioner, who may be fit and able to do another job, will get an increase of £6.  At a time when £1.4 million was available, persons with a disability, a handicap and those who are invalids should get as much, if not more, than those who could earn a little extra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGuinness said that farmers will have a great time and that they will come back into farming.  Why would they do that?  Pigs are now 40p a kilo, but farmers could get £1.40 a kilo for pigs a few years ago.  Cattle cannot be sold.  I agree that the £11 million in respect of the VAT increase is valuable, but unless the Minister and <Col N="419" /> the Government get off their backsides and get better prices for the products we produce, we will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to introduce the FIS means that nothing can be done to help farm families who have been badly hit and who are trying to cope in the Christmas season.  The best we can hope for is that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs will introduce a social welfare Bill as quickly as possible and ensure that the day that Bill is passed this new botched up farmers' dole scheme will be implemented immediately.  Many farm families want money now, not next winter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the carer's allowance whereby a carer who lives adjacent to the person he or she cares for will be eligible for the allowance.  I hope the small print in the social welfare legislation will not impede that change in eligibility for the allowance. The rainbow coalition Government provided an increase from £50 to £150 over two years in the amount a spouse could earn which would not be counted in respect of income assessed for eligibility for the carer's allowance, but that figure has not been increased in the past two years.  The other provisions are a help, but it would have been of real benefit if the threshold had been increased.  The change in medical cards is also welcome.  It will allow those over 70 years of age to benefit from an increased income allowance.</P>

      <P>In the greater Dublin area, traffic congestion has replaced crime as the key concern for ordinary people.  The difficulties being experienced in getting to and from work, school and shopping are exasperating for everyone.  This in turn causes stress, accidents, noise and pollution. When the Minister for Public Enterprise is making her case to the Government for an allocation to reduce gridlock, it would be helpful if a report to assess the full social, economic and environmental costs of the congestion was commissioned &mdash; not only in Dublin but throughout the State.  I am convinced this would provide startling statistics which would assist her in securing considerably more funding for public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when Dublin city was gridlocked during the peak morning and evening periods. <Col N="421" /> This is no longer the case; all routes into and out of the city centre are congested for most of the day.  This has become part of our daily routine and will get worse given the number of new vehicles which are being purchased.</P>
    <P>One alternative is the provision of a high quality, reliable public transport service on road or rail.  The inadequate number of trains serving the towns of Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock in my constituency is a matter of grave concern to me and is an issue which causes a great deal of anger for my constituents.  Commuters are squashed together like sardines and even in the toilets there is standing room only.  In such circumstances potential customers are not prepared to tolerate these conditions and will never be encouraged to leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>A change in public attitudes will only be encouraged by the provision of improved infrastructure such as new rolling stock and carriages. It is easy for the anti-public transport lobby, which has been listened to over the years, to point its finger at CIE, Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  Lack of infrastructural funding by consecutive Governments is responsible for the present crisis.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased that Irish Rail has taken delivery of 27 new carriages, 12 of which are in service at present, these are long overdue and more are required.  As a TD for Dublin North, I demand that, by the time these carriages are in service at the end of February, longer trains are provided on the northern suburban routes.  This will eliminate the safety hazard which currently exists and will encourage more people onto the trains.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport has once again broken all records for the number of passengers passing through it.  In view of this, it is inadequate that these passengers have no bus service directly to and from the city centre.  At present buses servicing Swords are redirected through the airport.  A terminus must be established at the airport to provide an ongoing service to the city centre and other growth areas accessible from the M50, such as Blanchardstown and Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The park and ride system needs to be extended.  I am impressed by the number of people willing to leave their cars in Whitehall and use the special buses which run every ten minutes.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus has ordered 200 new buses which are not wheelchair accessible.  Given the undertaking by the Department to provide wheelchair accessible buses, I want the Minister to state why she is not adhering to this policy, a matter of grave concern for people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate about the role of taxis and hackneys in providing a public transport service.  It is in the interests of both organisations that they reach a consensus on their respective roles.  If this is not forthcoming, I can see the Minister introducing legislation to completely <Col N="422" /> deregulate the system, which would not be in the interests of either party.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that relationships between the board of any semi-State organisation, which has such a significant role to play in public transport, and the Minister are not strained.  The Minister has appointed four new members to the board of CIE.  What is the relationship between the Minister, the chairman and the chief executive?  What example is being given?</P>
    <P>Bus corridors are necessary if timing and frequency of service are to improve.  Notwithstanding the media hype of last week, with the opening of the new bus corridor between Malahide and the city centre, responsibilities lie with the local authorities and the Garda to provide the necessary road space for the corridors.  Progress has been slow in this area over the years and that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>As gridlock grows there has been much debate in this House and elsewhere.  The people of Dublin, however, see very few practical results.  Let us commit ourselves to the implementation of some of these proposals.</P>

    <P>I welcome some of the measures taken in that time but in many areas this Government has failed lamentably in relation to the provision of a modern public transport system.  Fianna Fáil played a disgraceful political game with the taxi industry over the past year and a half.  It argued that there would not be 150 extra licences for the city.  What did it give us?  It gave us 1,250 licences.</P>

It is disgraceful that, while the Government has ordered 150 buses, it has not ordered buses accessible to the disabled despite our constant interaction with representatives of the disabled, such as the Centre for Independent Living.</P>

      <P>I am amazed at the motion put forward by the Fine Gael Leader and some Fine Gael Deputies although I can understand their concern about ensuring that Dublin commuters are afforded an improved taxi, bus and rail system. All Deputies, including me, are no stranger to the experience of sitting in traffic jams in Dublin. We have all experienced the stress and total frustration of wasting time we could put to better use while waiting for transport, and then sitting in the same transport in gridlock.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed Deputy John Bruton is not in the Chamber because I felt great sympathy for him on the much publicised occasion when he actually queued for a bus &mdash; a once in a lifetime experience.  I am sure his maiden outing has given him a deep understanding of the reality of life for the average commuter.  Life can be hard in the slow lane.</P>
      <P>I share the same anger that he and his cosignatories feel about public transport.  I agree that much needs to be done.  However, I am sorry he and his colleagues were not as vocal on this issue during their very recent term of office when they did nothing to address a situation that has increasingly worsened in recent years.  At least this Government has shown its commitment, in its rapid response to the short-term action plan published by the Dublin Transportation Office late last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has shown her intent to tackle the <Col N="424" /> traffic problems of the capital and the State at large, which is what we have come to expect of her.  She has no intention of resting on her laurels and waiting for a future date when she might contemplate or talk about the need for urgent action. She has addressed the issues the Opposition has so lately discovered.</P>
    <P>On the chaotic state of Dublin traffic, she has made positive decisions.  She has decided that the DART and suburban station platforms must be extended to cope with longer trains.  The purchase of 26 additional carriages and 47 extra suburban rail line coaches and the provision of new signalling are also on her agenda.  When all the measures are in place for rail improvements there will be capacity for an additional 11,300 passengers.</P>
    <P>The development of the quality bus corridors and 150 extra buses, will alleviate problems on our capital's streets caused by daily increasing motor car numbers.  The purchaser of 120 double decker buses by Dublin Bus as replacements will increase their peak hour capacity by another 2,500 passengers.</P>
    <P>The light rail advisory action group overseeing the planning and implementation of the Luas system held its initial meeting today.  This is a measure of the Minister's intent to proceed with what the Opposition was only willing to debate, but not implement, because of the cost implications. She has grasped the nettle.  Rail safety is a priority with this Government.</P>

      <P>Consultants have stressed the importance of this issue being addressed rather that being debated as an abstract, as was the practice of the last Government.  Almost £600 million will be spent over the next 15 years.  Of this, £12 million must be spent immediately to rectify the more pressing safety deficiencies.</P>
      <P>The task force set up by the Government will identify safety issues that must be prioritised.  This body, consisting of representatives from the Minister's department, the Department of Finance and CIE, is due to make its report by the end of January 1999.</P>
      <P>The Government will prepare a national development plan early next year.  On the basis of its recommendations, the Minister will present a strong case on the issue of public transport for the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport met all the relevant bodies in private and public transport.  Consultants on a transport initiative are being engaged by the committee this week.  This is the vision that is needed.  The nationwide demands must be recognised and met. I am pleased to see the Minister views the situation on a national scale.  When I read the motion, I could see the tunnel vision approach of an Opposition preoccupied with traffic problems in the greater Dublin area.  I remind them that there <Col N="425" /> is an Ireland outside the Pale &mdash; there are traffic problems in all 26 counties.</P>
    <P>These traffic problems are caused by the increase in the number of cars on our roads. People have more disposable income, thanks to the tiger economy, and are investing it, many of them in new cars.  Families have three and four cars now, which is adding to road congestion.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of 1997, we had the following number of vehicles registered on Irish roads: 1.134 million cars, 158,000 goods vehicles, 24,000 motor cycles and 16,000 public service vehicles. When one takes into account tractors and exempt vehicles, one ends up with 1.432 million vehicles on our roads.  Ten years ago, the total figure was 981,000, so there is an increase of 31.5 per cent. The Opposition should not blame the Minister for Ireland's successes, but should praise her for playing her role in meeting the problems it has caused.</P>
    <P>Cork city is now experiencing traffic congestion from early in the morning until late afternoon.  I know this will be a surprise to the proposers of the motion, whose total energies are devoted to solving the traffic problems that affect them in Dublin.  They do this to the exclusion of the interests of the travelling public of the State.  It is a nice and convenient approach &mdash; ignore the larger problems and they might go away.</P>
    <P>We heard a great many noises from Deputy Bruton and his colleagues during the Cork by-election. Congestion, gridlock and traffic delays were the catchphrases of the day.  However, they did not solve the Cork city traffic problem when they had the opportunity and they have not mentioned it since the recent canvass.  They won the seat and sat back.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has bothered to do something about it.  She visited Cork at my request and met CIE management and unions.  She travelled on the park-and-ride system to evaluate the effectiveness and success of the scheme, and did not even notify the photographers. There is now consideration for park-and-ride tax relief in this year's budget.  As a result of this visit, we are getting 34 new buses next year for Cork city &mdash; 18 city buses, ten commuter-type buses and six mini-buses.  That is what I call taking action and tackling a problem.</P>
    <P>To complement the additional fleet, Cork Corporation is planning to introduce six quality bus corridors, three in the north city and three in the south city.  This will help ease traffic congestion and encourage more people to use public transport in our city.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is to address the local issue and take cognisance of the larger problem of traffic congestion nationwide.  She is looking for a long-term solution for the whole country, and not a quick fix for just a sector of the country to answer the demands of a group with obvious vested political interests.  I unreservedly praise and support the Minister for her positive approach to the overall problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion by the Opposition because it gives us an opportunity to discuss the issue of the modern, urban phenomenon of gridlock in our major cities.  As a result of the success of recent years, we now have cities coming to a standstill at regular intervals throughout the day.</P>
      <P>The Opposition is in a cloud of amnesia.  It was obvious for years to everyone that something had to be done to address the fundamental problem of gridlock and traffic chaos in our cities.  I was delighted to hear Opposition Deputies talk about the fundamental need to invest in public transport, to insist on bus lanes and to ensure that trains and rail services are radically improved. The statistics show that nothing was done for many years.  It is only in recent times, since we came into office, that we have decided we must invest immediately in public transport, including rail, DART and bus services.  I am delighted the Minister has publicly committed herself to do what is required.</P>
      <P>On the funding of infrastructural development, we must take a radical approach to the development of our infrastructure with reduced funding from Europe, the continuous growth in the economy and increased car numbers.  We must opt for public-private investment funding.  Otherwise, we will stifle the economy's growth and bring the Celtic tiger to a very rapid standstill.</P>
      <P>When one travels from Dublin to Cork or Galway one sees the <i>ad hoc</i> planning by the National Roads Authority, whereby a bypass is planned and developed and the funding is provided but then a bypass or road is not planned for the next village.  We must develop a national strategy to design roads which will be funded by public-private investment.  If that is done, we can continue the growth of this economy well into the next millennium.</P>
      <P>My proposal for public-private partnership funding is that major insurance or banking institutions would provide the initial capital investment and the Government would operate a lease back system over a period.  The Government would not then have to lay out the initial capital sum and could lease back the infrastructure over a period of time and then it would be vested in the State.  There is a need for that, and if it is not done soon we will be unable to manage our infrastructure and develop it in the long-term because European funding will have dried up.</P>
      <P>On the issue of public transport, people will not use public transport unless there is an incentive in the form of bus lanes, ambience or the fact that it is cheaper and more time efficient.  So far our public transport systems are none of those things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>Huge investment in public transport is necessary.  I welcome the Minister's <Col N="427" /> announcement of 150 extra buses for Dublin and of extra buses for Cork.  If we are to continue down that road, along with car pooling and the encouragement of park and ride systems, it might go some way to alleviating the problems.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a major role to play, particularly in the planning of roadworks and road resurfacing.  I am amazed that local authorities insist on carrying out roadworks during peak traffic hours.  It perplexes me to this day that they cannot work out a schedule whereby roadworks are done when traffic is at a minimum. There are still major junctions in cities where local authorities dig up cross-roads on a Friday afternoon to carry out work, leave them unattended for the weekend and resume work on Monday.</P>
      <P>On the issue of car pooling, local authorities should set up a car pooling system whereby individuals who travel to the city from outside it each morning at a set time could feed relevant information into a computer system within the local authority, the local authority could correlate all the information received and facilitate car pooling for those who wish to do so.  Such car pooling could be encouraged by offering free parking to those who avail of it.  If this were tackled in a serious manner it would reduce the incidence of people sitting in gridlock every morning, one person to a car, and in a very short time the culture of using one car to transport four people to the city from outside it would be adopted by large numbers of people.  This would go a long way to addressing the problems of pollution and gridlock.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions made by Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation to encourage park and ride systems.  It is very effective and of major benefit wherever it has been put in place and has been properly enforced with bus lanes kept free.  In view of the new-found interest in public transport on the part of the leader of Fine Gael, would it be possible to institute a bus lane from the Dáil to County Meath to ensure that he is here on time for the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to discuss the transport system through to the port of Belview which I raised earlier this evening and the infrastructure which needs to be put in place to ensure the smooth flow of traffic from Carlow and Kilkenny through Waterford or <i>vice versa</i> to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the arguments put forward about public transport this evening, it takes about an hour to drive from Kilkenny to the Naas Road and about two and a half hours to get from there to Leinster House.  Something definite will have to be done to improve the efficiency of that route. If the train service from Carlow-Kilkenny were improved to the extent that one could rely on it, people who are involved in the decentralised offices in Kilkenny would use that service much more.  I am asking the Minister to look at Carlow-Kilkenny and to provide a commuter train service <Col N="428" /> to Kilkenny.  Many people commute from Kilkenny to Dublin to work.  They find it extremely difficult to access this city by road and are relying on what exists of the rail system.  Likewise, many companies in Kilkenny have employees who travel from Dublin each day and rely on the train service.  The timing of the service is wrong.  The trains are often overcrowded and uncomfortable, and the service is too slow.  I am asking for a proper commuter service.</P>
    <P>Traffic management through our cities should be a main priority.  Traffic management in medieval cities like Kilkenny should be prioritised by the Government to ensure that sufficient funds are made available to complete bypasses and inner-ring roads.</P>
    <P>The Government should also look at the possibility of providing a public transport service in Kilkenny city.  The city is now sprawling way beyond the old borough and houses are being built in their hundreds outside the main city area. People who live in these housing estates, like people in Dublin, are finding it extremely difficult to commute to their place of work, to transport children to and from school or to access services which are located in the centre of the city.  I encourage the Government to examine the possibility of providing a public transport service in a city the size of Kilkenny.  It is feasible but it needs intervention by the Government to ensure funding and provide a proper analysis of what is required.</P>
    <P>The damage that traffic is doing to the heritage of the cities also has to be monitored.  Kilkenny is a tourism destination.  The train service is inadequate and needs to be examined.  The services provided at the station are inadequate.  Finance should be provided to improve them.  The land adjacent to the station in Kilkenny could be sold and the proceeds invested in the further development of the station.  I acknowledge the work that has been done to date, but much more remains to be done, particularly in view of the speed at which the local economy is growing and the attraction of Kilkenny as a commercial centre and a destination for tourists.  In light of this debate I appeal to the Minister to ensure that a proper management study is carried out, that the ring roads are completed, that money is made available for the inner relief roads and that proper public transport is provided by way of a train service and a bus service for the residents of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the debate on this motion.  It gives Members an opportunity to outline our concerns.  Accepting that gridlock is a major problem in Dublin, and has been a bone of contention for the past ten years with very little progress being made to resolve it, the larger towns and areas of the south-east suffer from similar problems due to the massive increase in the number of people using cars and the lack of planning by local authorities generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan suggested that the Minister should attend meetings of the three Dublin <Col N="429" /> county councils and Dublin Corporation.  I hope she will attend such meetings.  Given that the Minister always adopts a hands-on approach, I hope she will attend and discuss with the councillors the possibilities for resolving some of the difficulties. Deputy Yates and I, and other Deputies travelling from the south-east, can get to Loughlinstown Hospital in an hour and ten minutes but it can take anything between an hour and two hours to get from there to Leinster House.  For the past seven months there have been roadworks at Loughlinstown and the slowness of progress on them continues to amaze me.  On the day of the &ldquo;choo-choo &lsquo;flu&rdquo; the roadworks increased to add to the major problems of rural people trying to get into the city.  I certainly hope the Minister knocks heads together and that all political parties come together to make an effort to resolve the difficulty for our country cousins and other people who want to do business in the city and find it very difficult from a time consuming point of view.</P>
    <P>I make a case for upgrading the railway line from Dublin to Rosslare which has been neglected by many Governments in recent years.  I welcome Deputy Yates's interest in it in the past year &mdash; for the previous three years when he was a Minister he failed to provide any money or acknowledge that a difficulty existed.  The rail line from Dublin to Rosslare is obsolete.  The track is out of date and the rolling stock dates from the 1970s and has very few facilities for passengers. The disabled have no facilities whatever on this rail line.  We are told it would cost £30 million to carry out work on 90 miles of track.  While EU funding has not been granted I ask the Minister to make a start on this.  The 1994 EU funding allocation clearly said the main reason funding was granted to other rail lines was the tourism potential and the economic viability of areas. Surely Rosslare, being a Euro port with one million passengers passing through each year, would be regarded as one of the major tourism areas. We need an adequate and proper rail line linking Rosslare to Dublin and Limerick.  Many excuses have been trotted out by different Ministers.  I hope the current Minister is listening and will ensure the Government makes adequate funds available.  We are not asking her to provide £30 million overnight, but we are asking for a start to be made in improving the tracks and rail line.</P>
    <P>The DART line is being extended to Greystones and probably in the near future to Wicklow Town.  What concerns me and the people living in the south east is what will happen on the line from Wicklow Town to Rosslare.  We are not prepared to allow that length of rail line to become completely obsolete and put out of action.  We need action from the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Regarding other areas of public transport, it is coming to the stage where local authorities will have to examine park and ride facilities in major towns.  Wexford Town is choked by traffic and it takes ages to travel around it.  The Minister for <Col N="430" /> the Environment and Local Government must become involved with local authorities in the provision of park and ride facilities which are now being provided and proving very successful in Dublin City.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate on transport and hope the Minister will listen to the call from the south east to immediately initiate the upgrade of the Dublin to Rosslare railway line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Callely.  This debate arises against a background of rising public frustration about traffic in our capital city and even greater and well publicised hysteria on the Opposition benches, in particular from Fine Gael.  There are no easy or quick fixes to Dublin's traffic congestion problems, yet if one was to listen and watch Deputy Bruton one would be forgiven for believing it was as simple as getting on a bus in d'Olier street and getting off again on College Green.</P>
      <P>There must be movement on the traffic issue on a number of fronts, but perhaps the most important move must be to shift a considerable amount of the expected growth in Dublin's population outside the city to the Leinster towns which can easily be expanded.  This means upgrading towns which are linked by rail to Dublin.  It means, dare I say it, more people who work in Dublin commuting from such previously far flung places as Portlaoise and the county town of the Minister's constituency, Mullingar.</P>
      <P>Within the city area the Government plan to build 11 quality bus corridors radiating from the city centre by next year is a commendable approach.  The success of the two existing and operational bus corridors has been prodigious. For example, the Lucan bus corridor which opened in the middle of 1997 has so far seen an increase of 54 per cent in the number of passengers using the route.  At least 25 per cent of these passengers were previously using their cars for journeys to and from the city centre. Commuters on the comparable Malahide route have experienced a reduction of some 30 per cent in the time they spend making the journey to the city centre.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of Dublin South West there will be vast improvements when the Luas line is finally opened.  Work is expected to begin towards the end of next year with a completion date in 2002.  All of this is very welcome news. Consultants Arthur Andersen are currently looking at possible extensions to that and other projected Luas lines.  They will do so in the context of public-private partnerships and I hope in my constituency they look seriously at extending Luas to the City West business park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Árd Fheis speech the Taoiseach put the City West campus to the forefront as a location for electronic commerce.  He stated it was his intention to make it a world class location for ecommerce. While City West currently employs upwards of a 1,000 people, in the long run this digital business park is expected to employ more <Col N="431" /> than 7,000 people making it a far bigger project than the Irish Financial services Centre in the Dublin Docklands.</P>
    <P>I use this debate to call on the Minister and the Taoiseach to make the extension of the Luas line to City West a top priority for the millennium.  In the context of the area itself, extending Luas to the City West business park would also be of benefit to west Tallaght which houses some of the most disadvantaged communities in the country. Extending Luas would help in bringing these areas back into the mainstream.</P>
    <P>In terms of improved traffic management in the City of Dublin I also welcome the move by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, to further deregulate the taxi and hackney business in Dublin.  Hackney drivers deserve to be allowed use bus lanes in the same manner as taxis currently do.  In addition, it is welcome to see some moves towards allowing hackneys have some form of identification on their vehicles and use two way radios.  This is how things operate in the UK and other countries on the Continent and it is long overdue here.  Taxis and hackneys have a very strong role to play in evolving public transport in Dublin and other urban locations.</P>
    <P>The recent budget announcements of tax incentives for those who establish park and ride facilities is a welcome boost and I hope it will lead to greater investment.  The decision not to apply benefit in kind to bus and rail tickets bought for workers by their employers is another commendable move.  It will shift people on to public transport and will become part of the standard wage and salary package for workers in the years ahead.  This kind of non-pay incentive will also play a part in dampening down wage inflation, a problem with which the economy is currently wrestling.</P>
    <P>There is a paradox to the provision of greater public transport infrastructure.  It tends to pull even more people in to live in a city or urban conurbation.  This occurred in London with the M25 orbital road which was built to solve congestion but which very rapidly became a further source of even greater congestion.  This is the essential paradox of developing and modernising cities and urban areas in the modern age.  It appears that increasing infrastructure attracts more people to live in an area.  This is why it is imperative that the Government consider a very thorough programme of regional development, including building up the infrastructure and facilities in areas which qualify for Objective One status to relieve pressure on cities such as Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to focus on the issues pertaining to Dublin and draw attention to the fact that I have tabled a number of questions on this matter, some of which are due for answer tomorrow. For anybody to use the public service transport network in the city we must ensure it is satisfactory <Col N="432" /> and meets all the demands of the public. I am not satisfied that this is so.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the quality bus corridor in the Malahide-Fairview area.  I raised this matter at the city council last Monday night and there was much debate on it.  We must recognise that there are businesses in the city before we put in quality bus corridors without buses and start roadworks without signs.  That was crazy.  We must ensure that the public transport system, which is subsidised, meets the social demands of people, particularly late at night.  We cannot blame taxi drivers for not providing that service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be sharing my time with Deputies Ring, Deenihan, Stanton and Sargent.  I support the Fine Gael motion, as transport and traffic are literally the talk of the town.  The first thing people talk about when they get to work is how long it has taken them to get there and the traffic they encountered.  It is the same when they get home or go shopping.  There is no doubt that some of the present traffic difficulties in Dublin are the result of economic success.  The increases in the number of private cars and in the amount of freight going through our cities are the result of economic activity.  It is the price of success.</P>
      <P>However, the problems with Dublin traffic are also due to the Government's lack of action.  It has been clear for a long time that the solution to the traffic problem is a major shift to public transport.  Deputy Kelleher is wrong when he says the last Government did not deal with this situation; it did.  The DTO strategy was put in place, and that pointed clearly at a radical shift towards a public transport solution for Dublin.  The last Government also made the critical decision to proceed with the flagship of the DTO strategy, the Luas project, by introducing the necessary legislation.  It made critical and difficult decisions about that project.</P>
      <P>The momentum to deal with the Dublin traffic problem was initiated by the last Government, but the present Minister and Government will be remembered for losing that momentum.  They have done so first by delaying the Luas project and then deciding to go underground with it.  We do not know for how long the project will be delayed.  Part of the reason is that we do not know what the Minister and her technical people will find when they go underground.  The geological assessment of whether it is possible to go underground has apparently not been done or reported on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A parliamentary question on this matter was put down by one of my colleagues, and part of the question related to the geological assessment, if any, given to the Minister.  It was disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle's office, and I accept that decision.  However, I find it strange that all other aspects of the question &mdash; whether the decision to go underground will cost additional money, what action has been taken since the Government decision of May 1998 &mdash; could be answered except the matter of the geological assessment <Col N="433" /> and the prospects of going underground.  I was told that the Minister has no official responsibility to the Dáil in this matter as it is a matter for CIE.</P>
    <P>This is a classic case of the Minister shifting ground.  The technical assessment of going underground has suddenly left the Minister's desk and become a matter for CIE.  She makes the decision to go underground, though she was told at the time that there were serious geological implications.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Now she has suddenly washed her hands of the geological implications. She does not know what shifting sands are underground, but she has certainly shifted the sands in CIE's direction.  It is now their responsibility. When the day arrives, as it may if the Atkins prediction is borne out, that the geologists find the underground option is not on, then Luas will be off the table again.</P>
      <P>This is the Government that has made a critical and fatal decision to postpone the Luas project and drive it underground in more senses than one &mdash; to drive it underground permanently.  That will leave the people of Dublin strangled by an appalling traffic problem that is tying up the economy of the city.</P>
      <P>If we are seriously to shift to a public transport system we do not need exhortations to people to use public transport.  Realistically, one can only expect people to use such a system when it is available, reliable, comfortable and economical. Unfortunately, the present public transport system in Dublin is none of those things.  We do not have enough buses, and the DART does not operate after 11.30 p.m. Staff are not available in some stations from early in the evening, which makes some people feel the stations are unsafe. Because there are so few buses the service is unreliable and bus users must regularly wait a very long time for a bus to arrive.  When it does come it is often overcrowded and uncomfortable, an experience shared by train commuters, particularly those taking weekend trains out of Dublin. Often there is standing room only on those trains.</P>
      <P>In that context I draw attention to the Minister's stated intention to increase fares on Dublin Bus.  That is a lunatic decision if we are to shift to public transport, as increasing fares on the transport system will only worsen Dublin's traffic problems.  Instead of increasing fares, I call on the Minister to increase the subvention for Dublin's public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to Dublin's chronic traffic problem requires an efficient public transport system with an attractive fares structure.  Bus and DART fares are already high.  A return journey from the outer suburbs to the city for a couple and two children costs £6.60, which certainly makes it cheaper and more attractive to bring a car if they have one.  Increasing fares will only create hardship for those on low incomes and encourage those who have cars to continue using them.  With <Col N="434" /> the prospect of Luas disappearing further and further into the distant future, Dublin Bus will remain the key element of the public transport system in the greater Dublin area.  Despite the public perception to the contrary, the level of public subvention for Dublin Bus is less than 4p per passenger journey.  While some funds from the delayed Luas project have been provided for new buses, the general level of subvention remains one of the lowest among similarly sized cities in Europe.  The Minister's announcement that fares are to go up is very bad news for commuters and those facing the traffic problem.  It should not proceed.</P>

      <P>As a west of Ireland Deputy I sympathise with my colleagues in Dublin on the massive problem here.  However, the question that should be asked is why this problem was created. We have a problem in the west of Ireland in that we cannot keep the population there.  Government after Government could not get enough people, cars and factories into Dublin, forgetting about the rest of the country.  When the Government had an opportunity to redress the situation in terms of Objective One status it included Kerry and Clare to make sure Ireland would not get such status and the west would not get the needed infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I have listened to debate on Luas, DART and buses but none of these are to be found in the west and only for private companies, people from Mayo would not be able to travel anywhere.  For many years, Government after Government neglected the rail network.  A recent report has shown it is very dangerous.  People must use cars to travel up and down to Dublin because they are afraid to use public transport.  Why does Government always have to think about Dublin?  Many civil servants work and live in Dublin and they forget about the rest of the country.  What is happening in the west matters and people in the west are entitled to the same standard of public transport.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann does not go into north Mayo but there is a train service between Castlebar and Dublin.  Leaving Castlebar for Dublin on a train at 8 a.m. due to arrive at 11 a.m., one would be lucky to arrive at 3 p.m. some days.  On the return journey, having booked a seat one would be lucky to get on the back of the train because seats would have been overbooked.  This must change and the Government must put policies in place that cater for the entire country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A monster has been created in Dublin by all Governments but there is an easy way to resolve many of these problems.  First, many Departments should be relocated from Dublin to rural areas.  There is beautiful countryside in the west and nobody has ever been eaten there.  People would love to live there.  There are nice schools, but a bad infrastructure and no roads.  When there was an opportunity to redress this in the application for Objective One status the entire Dublin city brigade was afraid we might catch up <Col N="435" /> with them.  We are not looking for any more than Dublin people.  I love to see Dublin people getting on but I represent the west and we did not get our fair share of the national cake for the past 50 years.  The people of the west will not accept it any longer.</P>
    <P>There are massive transport problems in Dublin. There was one car between three or four houses 20 years ago whereas I recall that during the recent by-elections in Dublin and Cork there were four cars outside some houses.  We did not keep pace in terms of developing our infrastructure. The road between Longford and Westport is not just the worst road in the country but in the world.  If one travels between Mullingar and Dublin there are motorways and bypasses.  In some cases three rounds of Structural Funds were provided but the west could not even get one round.</P>
    <P>A problem has been created in the cities which could be resolved easily.  Public servants should be relocated.  The Department of Agriculture and Food should be moved to the west because many people would love to live there if they had the opportunity.  I hope the Government will not do what it has done with the National Roads Authority. No Deputy was elected by the NRA, yet when the a parliamentary question to do with roads is tabled to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, he says that it is the responsibility of the NRA.  The NRA does not represent anybody and now somebody there will probably be put in charge of transport.  Then when Deputy Gilmore tables a parliamentary question to the Minister he will say he does not have responsibility for it.  Ministers are good at delegating responsibility to make sure they must not make a decision.</P>
    <P>Difficult decisions must be made during the coming years.  Infrastructure must be put in place in Dublin and the west and I hope we get our fair share of the national cake.  The first thing that must be done is to allocate funds to the rail service between Dublin and Westport.  It is a disaster and I know the Government's agenda is to close it down, but that will not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the rail network between Mallow and Tralee.  More than 2 million tourists visit Kerry every summer and they arrive by road, air and rail.  Unfortunately, the road network is totally inadequate and inferior to others throughout the country.  There is but one decent road coming into Kerry.  There has been no investment in the road coming into the county from Limerick over the past ten years despite all the Structural Funds.  We are relying very heavily on Kerry County Airport and last year 250,000 people passed through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is also a great reliance on the train service, which is inadequate.  Trains are rarely, if ever, on time not because of those driving them or looking after them, but because of the totally substandard rail line.  A large number <Col N="436" /> of young people from County Kerry work and study in Dublin, with many of them involved in banking, IT and the Civil Service.  They like to come home to County Kerry for a number of reasons every weekend, especially during the summer but they are provided with an inferior service.  Most of them cannot even get a seat on the train, which was also mentioned by Deputy Ring.</P>
    <P>There were two very serious derailments on the line between Killarney and Tralee during the past three years and it was very fortunate that nobody was killed or seriously injured.  On 26 June the Minister announced an investment package of £26 million for mainline rail track upgrading as part of the reallocation of the EU aid decommitted from the Luas project.  A sum of £10 million was invested in the line between Mallow and Killarney, which I welcome, but there was no investment in the line between Killarney and Tralee where the main problems lie and where these incidents occurred.  Page 42 of the Review of Rail safety in Ireland published this year gives a summary of its results.  The Mallow-Tralee line ranked second in Ireland in terms of the predicted train accident frequency per year after the Connolly Station-Mullingar line.  It is vitally important that County Kerry should have a proper rail line running from Mallow to Tralee because of its huge dependency on tourism.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not allow the debate to pass without referring to Ireland's second city, Cork.  Traffic problems in Cork city have now reached unacceptably high levels.  Rush hour, morning and evening, in the city centre results in traffic gridlock almost every day, choking the city and frustrating thousands of commuters on their way to and from work.  In urban areas, nationally, the economic costs of traffic delays, the environmental costs of so many cars on the road and inadequate infrastructure have become unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The explanation for Dublin's problems has been that our unprecedented growth rates in recent years have overloaded the existing and planned infrastructure.  However, the same cannot be said of Cork.  In the 20 years which have passed since the Cork Land Use and Transportation Plan was devised, £300 million has been invested in the infrastructure and road network in the greater Cork area.  The resulting ring road has improved traffic flow considerably.  The full benefit will be reaped when the Lee Tunnel opens, the Blackpool bypass is completed and the west link is extended to bypass Ballincollig.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, upgrading the public transport system in Cork will maximise the benefit of the infrastructural investment.  Dual carriageways are of little use at peak times if they are jammed with cars.  Motorists in Dublin know what I am talking about because within months of the completion of the M50 motorway signs were erected saying &ldquo;peak time delays&rdquo; or &ldquo;20 minutes from here to next exit&rdquo;.  We must learn lessons from this and <Col N="437" /> attempt to ensure free flowing traffic in Cork and other growing cities.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister does not need me to tell her that more people than ever can afford to buy cars.  The number of cars on the road in Cork has doubled in five years.  There are too many cars going into and out of Cork city centre, regardless of how big we build our roads.  The only way to reduce the traffic problem is to offer people a realistic alternative to taking their cars into the city centre by providing attractive public transport.  The current public transport system is grossly inadequate, not because of lack of will or effort by Bus Éireann in Cork but because of lack of funding.</P>
    <P>People will use public transport if it is properly provided.  The success of the Cobh/Cork commuter rail link and the Victoria</P>
    <P>Cross/County Hall park and ride facility shows what can be achieved when people are presented with a quality public transport alternative to the private car.  During the by-election in Cork traffic was a key concern and I looked at ways of improving the public transport system, consulting with Bus Éireann and many commuters.  Fine Gael devised a plan which would cost the Government only £13 million; it included the provision of quality new buses and the creation of bus corridors in certain traffic black spots in the city, as has now been proposed for Dublin.  At present the average age of a bus in Cork is 12 years, hardly the sort of vehicles which will attract new users.  We must invest in new buses.  With so many Government TDs in Cork I am surprised and disappointed that the recent budget contains no commitment to purchase any new buses for Cork, despite the fact that Dublin is to get 150 new buses over a phased time period.</P>
    <P>Park and ride facilities are needed also, but they are required all year, not just at Christmas, and they must be connected to the ring road, so that people can park cars safely outside the city centre and catch a shuttle bus service into town. Areas such as Douglas, Bishopstown and Grange on the south side of the city, and Dillion's Cross, Blackpool and Gurranebraher on the north side of the city were prioritised for park and ride services.</P>
    <P>It seems that advanced planning by the people of Cork over 20 years ago which is resulting in a superb infrastructure is to be thwarted by this Government's inability to learn the lessons of the Dublin traffic experience.  Are we to wait until the problem is out of control, despite the existence of obvious, agreed and relatively inexpensive potential solutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Coveney's remarks.  Driving into Cork city from the east is a nightmare.  This was not the case two or three years ago, but it is now unbelievable.  Traffic on the dual carriageway is backed up for two miles. The road from Midleton to the city is one of the best of the country; the east Cork parkway, a <Col N="438" /> marvellous two lane dual carriageway, was opened last year by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  However, one then goes from the 21st century to the 19th century &mdash; cars meet a skewed bridge and go into a single lane system.  People are frustrated, angry, and want to know why something is not being done.  It is unbelievable that one can travel 15 miles in 20 minutes and then travel two miles in an hour.  Cars engines are idling, polluting the air.</P>
      <P>However, there is a solution.  I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, in the House, because I am sure he will remember that last year I reminded him of the opportunity to open the rail link to Midleton, which would solve the problem straightaway.  It would cost less than</P>
      <P>£10 million to do this and it would take many cars off the road.  My colleague mentioned the Lee tunnel, which has been called the greatest civil engineering project in the State.  However, that was planned before we had gridlock and by the time it comes on stream it will not solve the problem. The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, was quoted by <i>The Examiner</i> in October as saying that she would re-open the rail link but Iarnród Éireann informed me today that it has no plans to do so. There is a contradiction.  This would cost a small amount of money but would solve many problems for the people of east Cork, and also those travelling from Dublin who have to cross the skewed bridge.  I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with it, but he is welcome to come to Cork during rush hour to see it, as he would then feel the same frustration as the rest of us.</P>
      <P>Why does the Cork-Dublin train slow down on the line?  We have a good rail link but it takes a lot longer than it should.  The train is overcrowded and there are not enough carriages. Iarnród Éireann does not seem to be able to plan for more passengers.  It is dangerous when the trains are packed to capacity &mdash; there is no standing room, let alone sitting room.</P>
      <P>There is an air link between Cork and Dublin but it is not a proper one &mdash; it is expensive and there is no competition.  Could the Government consider introducing competition on the route?</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Yates agus a chomhleacaí i bhFine Gael as a chuid ama a roinnt.  This subject is close to my heart.  Public transport is always short of investment and what investment there is tends to be focused where the lobbying is strongest, which is in the interest of the private motorist, the AA and ancillary lobby groups.  The Government has put a spin on its public transport investment, which even the Minister said was not easy to obtain.  A qualified welcome has been given to the 150 buses being added to the fleet of 900 in Dublin.  One must still ask the basic questions: first, why an order was not put in for LPG buses; and second, why no account was taken of the needs of people with disabilities in ordering the fleet.  Perhaps the order has not yet been placed and there may be time to change it to take <Col N="439" /> those needs into account.  There is a vigil at Heuston Station and the Minister may be aware that these people are incensed that they will not be facilitated in the new public transport investment. One would think they would be taken into account.  DG 16 of the European Commission, which is behind £8.5 million of this investment, has stated that no funds are to be used which do not cater for people with disabilities.  Not only should these buses carry a sign reading &ldquo;Luas R.I.P.&rdquo;&mdash; for this is the money which would have been spent on light rail &mdash; but we should also remember we could be endangering European funding and putting ourselves in a bad position with the Commission by mis-spending funds and neglecting people with disabilities.  It is not public transport when members of the public are excluded &mdash; it is elitist transport.</P>
      <P>Unless the Government gives priority to buses, railways, bicycles and pedestrians, not only will we choke on traffic fumes but the congestion will continue to lose us millions of pounds in business and in fines for excess CO 2 emissions which we are obliged to reduce under the Kyoto protocol. As things stand we will have to pay between £500 million and £1 billion unless we reduce emissions. We are obliged to contribute to public transport, and it is in everyone's interest to do so.</P>
      <P>The people I represent in Fingal are obliged to stand on buses and trains when going to work or school.  They must wait in the rain because there are no bus shelters.  If they are travelling into town from Swords, they must go on a tour <i>via</i> Dublin Airport.  This might be a novelty on the first occasion but it becomes tedious and unnecessary if one is travelling to work on the bus every day.  They have no Sunday train service. Deputy Gilmore said the DART stops at 11.30 p.m, but that would be a luxury in north County Dublin where there is no late night service.  There is no park and ride capacity worth talking about at the train stations.  The spaces for cars and bicycles are usually full unless one is up at the crack of dawn and gets there before anybody else. The few cycle ways start and finish in the middle of nowhere.  They are nothing more than tokens to satisfy somebody in the European Commission who has not looked too carefully at the situation.</P>
      <P>We are way behind our compatriots in other European Union countries.  Unless the Government starts to give an example, the hypocrisy will add to the neglect and put us in bad stead for assistance for future investment in public transport. Every ministerial car weighs about two tonnes and pumps out six tonnes of CO 2 every year.  This is a fine example and this is where we should start to change.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Members who spoke on this important subject.  It is fair to conclude, based on what Deputies said, that there is strong support for increased investment in public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="440" /> A number of Deputies noted that this commitment to public transport is new and rightly referred to the long period of under-investment in public transport.  The economic boom of recent years has provided the means for many more people to acquire private cars and the effects in terms of traffic congestion are, unfortunately, there for all to see.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies also referred to the air and noise pollution aspects of traffic.  We are all increasingly conscious of our health and of the general damage to the environment, including to buildings, caused by air pollution.  Our cities were designed long before the private car was invented.  When the cities were being laid out, travel was limited to very few people.  Nobody today would agree to tearing the city apart to facilitate cars and, in any case, the evidence from other countries suggests this would not be the solution.</P>
    <P>There is also widespread agreement in the House that there is not a magic alternative formula for dealing with traffic in our cities.  A number of speakers pointed out that a co-ordinated approach is essential and that is at the root of the Government's plans.  This involves providing additional bus and rail capacity, introducing quality bus corridors to improve bus performance, developing the light rail project as quickly as possible, improving traffic management, encouraging cycling and walking, providing incentives for developing park and ride facilities and providing incentives for employers to encourage their employees to use public transport.</P>
    <P>We have all been disappointed at the pace of introduction of quality bus corridors.  This has often been due to concerns by local people that they will suffer substantial adverse consequences in the wake of QBCs.  I have no doubt the people involved are genuinely concerned and the success of these corridors depends on their acceptance by the public.  Members of the House have a duty to allay public concerns and to encourage the people of Dublin to put their faith in a revitalised public transport system.</P>
    <P>The Lucan QBC has been an enormous success. In the very short time the Malahide Road QBC has been operating, there has been a huge take up by passengers, although one Deputy made adverse comments about it.  There is also plenty of evidence from other European cities of the enormous improvements which public transport brings to the economy, lifestyles and environmental conditions in cities.</P>
    <P>The Minister already listed the component parts of the Government's programme to deal with traffic congestion.  It would be wonderful if the problem could be solved tomorrow, but that is unrealistic.  However, the Government's programme will result in the full complement of 150 extra buses being available before the end of 1999 and the DART and suburban rail fleet expansion will be completed by the end of 2000.  This will be the biggest single increase in bus and rail capacity since the DART was introduced.</P>
    <P>DART and suburban rail have been a major <Col N="441" /> success.  Their success is the cause of much of the current criticism about overcrowding.  The extra rolling stock will expand suburban rail capacity by 60 per cent.  At the same time the extension of the DART service to Greystones and Malahide and doubling the suburban rail track between Clonsilla and Maynooth will bring the convenience and safety of rail travel to a much larger population.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Government provided tax incentives which will encourage private sector development of park and ride facilities.  The budget also removes the benefit-in-kind taxation obstacle to employers who wish to offer their staff rail or bus tickets in place of company cars.</P>
    <P>In the medium term, the light rail project, which the Minister launched in a re-energised and expanded form last May, will provide a significant improvement in Dublin public transport for the new millennium.  The Minister is pushing the project ahead vigorously on several fronts.  The public inquiry on the Tallaght to Abbey Street line has just been completed.  The consultants to advise the Minister about public private partnership options for the project have been selected and the first meeting of the light rail advisory action group has taken place.</P>
    <P>Another strong argument in favour of public transport is that trains and buses are significantly more friendly to the environment in several ways compared to the private car.  The amount of energy consumed per person carried is much less, resulting in reduced levels of all forms of air pollution. Buses and trains also make much better use of the limited road space and reduce the need for parking space.</P>
    <P>At a time when we are all concerned about the level of death and injury in road accidents, it is important to recognise that trains and buses provide a much safer means of travel than cars.  The Minister has spoken in the House on a number of occasions about the independent review of railway safety which she commissioned.  While Iarnrod Éireann has a very satisfactory safety record by international standards, everybody is aware that the railway has suffered most through under-investment.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the future of the railway and to ensuring, on the basis of the advice of the independent consultants, that it will be safe.  The high level task force is due to report to the Minister at the end of January with prioritised recommendations for implementing the safety consultants' findings and I have no doubt the Minister will act on the recommendations without delay.</P>
    <P>I commend the amended motion to the House on the basis that it reflects the vigorous approach of the Government to the issue of public transport. It is the first comprehensive approach of its kind.</P>

      <P>Mullingar is a rapidly growing town and the necessity for an adequate commuter rail link to Dublin has never been more acute. Upwards of 100 workers and students daily use the existing commuter link which leaves Mullingar at 6.45 a.m. and arrives in Dublin at 8.30 a.m. if they are lucky.  The quality of the carriages and the unreliability of the service leave much to be desired.</P>
      <P>In the recent debate on the report on rail safety, I called on the Minister to bring forward the committed investment for the Dublin-Mullingar rail link to upgrade the line and signalling equipment and thus make it safer.  A sum of £12.5 million has been allocated for track renewal and £5 million for signalling.  However, the benefits of these improvements will not come on stream until the end of next year.  Why does the Minister not let out this work to private contractors or take on additional employees to do it?  Why can this programme of renewal not be accelerated to improve safety and efficiency on the line?  This proposal was endorsed by many Fianna Fáil Party Deputies when I made it in the House previously. I am disappointed the Minister has not responded.</P>
      <P>A further £17.5 million is to be spent on providing a second rail track from Dublin to Maynooth and to improve rail safety as far as Carrick-on-Shannon. This will take at least three years to finalise.  I call on the Minister to immediately authorise the provision of a second rail track all the way to Mullingar from Dublin, serving Maynooth, Enfield, Killucan and Mullingar and thus enabling the many road users currently commuting to Dublin every day to avail of an efficient rail service.</P>
      <P>As the roads become clogged with traffic, investment in the railway network makes sense. Investing in track serving provincial towns is particularly wise because it complements the already available development land, sewerage facilities, schools and recreational and social facilities which exist in towns.  The existing travel time of one hour and 45 minutes from Mullingar to Dublin is unacceptably long.  The reintroduction of a dual track would greatly reduce this travel time.  It should be noted that a dual track existed previously between Mullingar and Dublin, but dismantling of it began in the 1920s.  It is now time to restore this line.  Rail travel is the form of travel of the future.  If we are to move forward and improve efficiency and mobility, the way forward is to improve our rail lines.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to highlight the problems on the Dublin-Sligo line, especially the section from Mullingar through Longford to Carrick-on-Shannon.  Recently the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, announced £15 million would be allocated for work on that section of the line.  Since then the safety report has highlighted <Col N="443" /> that section of the line as being in need of immediate action.</P>
      <P>Recently I had occasion to travel on the Cork-Dublin line and my trip was successful.  The difference between the Cork-Dublin line and the Dublin-Sligo line was a shock to the system.  I was inclined to remain on the train and return to Cork.  The Dublin-Sligo line has become a subject of legend.  However, we must be positive and optimistic.  The Minister has announced an increased service for the Maynooth-Dublin section of the line.  This will relieve much of the overcrowding from Maynooth to Dublin especially on the earlier trains which make many stops.  The same applies in the evening time.  I look forward to seeing the money committed to that section being spent on it.</P>

      <P>When will legislation be introduced to deal with the issue of accountability as referred to in that report?  The Knockcroghery train crash resulted from fatigue on the line.  Fatigue in the metal cannot be seen by the workers since they do not have the resources to detect it.  This will be a cause of further accidents in the future, as determined by that report.  In the past fortnight cattle were killed on the line between Athlone and Claremorris.  The issue of accountability in legal terms needs to be addressed quickly rather than attempt to blame the workers on that line who do not have the necessary equipment to detect metal fatigue.</P>
      <P>Investment attracts investment.  Coca Cola is spending £100 million in Ballina.  The line from Manulla to Ballina is in a terrible condition and the train is not much better.  Before investing in Ireland, companies look at all the available facilities and obviously the quality of the rail link is of critical importance.  If we are serious about Objective One status and so on and want to attract investment to take pressure away from Dublin, Cork and Limerick, these areas should be given facilities and resources.</P>
      <P>The projected traffic counts by the National Roads Authority over the next several years show a 60 per cent increase in car numbers.  Irrespective of how fast road development takes place in Dublin, cars will continue to choke north, west and south of Dublin.  Even with massive investment in inner relief and outer relief roads there will be an increased number of cars on the roads which will bring its own complications.</P>

    <P>When stopped at traffic lights in Donnybrook <Col N="444" /> recently, I counted 53 cars in a row, each with one occupant.  If people were sharing that should be about 15 cars.  Has there been a trawl by the Department and contact with local authorities as to the extent of road design completed and approved for investment under EU funding.  We always blame Governments and Ministers for not providing funding for roads.  Either the local authorities or the National Roads Authority has responsibility for road design and approval. When money is available it should be spent where road designs have been approved and accepted. There should be clarification of what is involved.</P>
    <P>I dislike the term, park and ride.  The term is American and the service is provided in towns in the United States.  The term has different connotations here and is the butt of too many jokes. Perhaps we should do as we did in many other cases and use an Irish translation &mdash; fág agus taisteal. The Irish language is clear in its uniqueness in that it clarifies what is meant by particular words.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate, particularly the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Green Party for their support.  I am disappointed none of the Independent Deputies saw fit to rate public transport on their agenda.  I note the Taoiseach and his cohorts have not attended the debate.  This issue should be put at the top of the political agenda.  One gets the mistaken impression that the Government is doing something about this issue.  The only thing the Government did was stop the Luas project and reallocate the money to some urgent projects. After the Cabinet decision in May, we waited patiently for the Atkins report on Luas which suggested Luas should proceed overground.  The Government went into a huddle and came out with a hybrid that Luas should go underground. We do not know what type of roller coaster there will be once St. Stephen's Green is dug up.  When we get into this black hole we do not know what it will cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the truth of it.  We were told that people from the Orient, the Japanese, were going to invest in it.  Where are they now?  In October the Minister told us she had the solution to the financial need which we set at £1.5 billion. CIE was about to sell property.  We investigated that matter and between £25 million and £40 million per year will come from that.  The Minister has no policy.  In November the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, announced a £56 million Exchequer investment in public transport.  Today, for the first time ever, the Exchequer is providing direct capital.  A radio station telephoned me with the good news.  I read through it and was quite pleased.  It mentioned the provision of new buses, 16 new DART carriages and 20 suburban rail cars.  I then realised this looked familiar.  This was the same announcement which was made in May, <Col N="445" /> June and July with the £14 million taken from Luas and spent yet again.  When not waffling, the Minister is trying to convince the people she is doing something.</P>
      <P>In this debate the Minister made two announcements.  She is awaiting a report from Judge O'Leary.  Not only has she had the Atkins report, three CIE reviews, DTO reviews and a Luas watchdog report, but she announced two further reports, an Arthur Anderson consultancy study to look at the financing of Luas and an ESRI report on transport needs commissioned by the Department of Finance.  The Government has no proposal, except that in January there will be bus and rail increases.  Deputy Stagg referred to zero fares on certain routes on the Continent. The Minister did not seem to remember the script she had read out that she was pleased to announce she would respond favourably to the request by CIE for the first increase in bus fares since 1991.  She mentioned a rate of inflation of 19 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned the Government has not grasped the enormity of the problem.  I fear that by the time we next debate this matter there will have been a serious derailment.  We will be able to show in the coming weeks that what IRMS actually said was that three railway routes &mdash; Mallow-Tralee, <Col N="446" /> Athlone-Claremorris and WaterfordRosslare &mdash; should have been closed, such was the intolerable level of risk.  That is extremely serious.  In addition, the DART will not run at night and no extra buses will be available until at least 1 May 1999.  No extra DART carriages will be available until the next century.  The seats are being taken out of DART trains because there is insufficient space to carry people.</P>
    <P>This Government must take a big, bold, imaginative step.  I have outlined a simple way of dealing with this issue; the Government has already decided on the IPO for Telecom Éireann &mdash; 50.1 per cent of the company is for sale and that sale will yield in the region of £1.5 billion. That figure would provide the lion's share of the extra capital required.  The Luas project will not receive EU funding because of the Objective One regionalisation decision.  The Minister for Public Enterprise is waffling and the Minister for Finance is being evasive.  There is no coherent strategy in this area.  More reports are being carried out and bus fares are increasing.</P>
    <P>This issue must be placed at the top of the political agenda as it will not go away.  It is taking commuters longer to bring children to school and to get to work.  That is unacceptable.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Kilkenny Textile Mills.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>Kilkenny Textile Mills has a factory located in Kilkenny city employing in excess of 80 people.  In recent weeks and months a number of them have been laid off on a continuous basis.  Two thirds of the product manufactured by Kilkenny Textile Mills is purchased by Santens in Belgium.  The other one third is offered on the open market.  As part of the package that should be put in place to ensure the viability of the company, that one third should be marketed on the basis of local indigenous industry supporting the company and purchasing its product.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny Textile Mills has been an excellent employer since Fieldcrest first operated in the industrial estate in which it is located.  It unfortunately closed down.  Kilkenny Textile Mills took up the challenge, offered a number of jobs and has continued to employ 80 people.</P>
      <P>We all know the difficulties facing the textile industry from the various low cost countries.  The market is being affected and this is affecting the situation in Kilkenny.  Employees being let go during the Christmas period should be given maximum social welfare payments and the question of taxation on them should be reviewed.  The Minister should also negotiate with Kilkenny Textile Mills to ensure that the one third of the market about which it is concerned is fully developed to give the company the opportunity to continue with a programme of full employment without any lay-offs in the future.</P>
      <P>In the recent creation of 1,400 jobs for the country, not one was announced by Enterprise Ireland for Kilkenny city or county.  That has been the case historically.  Bearing in mind the Bellview operation, approximately 400 jobs have been created by IDA Ireland for Kilkenny. Nationally that figure does not stand up.  It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>I am asking for immediate action on Kilkenny Textile Mills and an immediate offer of support to the company.  If we acknowledge now at an early stage that the textile industry is going through serious difficulties, that there are serious problems in the market place and that there are serious challenges from other low cost countries we could create a mechanism that would at least bridge the gap and make the playing field a little more level.</P>
      <P>With regard to the employees, I ask the Minster to intervene at Christmas to ensure they get the maximum benefits and that the question of taxation on the benefits is analysed to see what can be done to alleviate it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the recent developments at Kilkenny Textile Mills.  The <Col N="449" /> move to short-time working is a disappointing development for the plant.  However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the company must react to the market and it is better that necessary corrective action is taken now by way of short-time working to help safeguard jobs in the plant.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny Textile Mills has been operating regular short-time working through 1998 by agreement with the unions.  The workers have been taking one week off in four to maintain full employment and to match the fall in demand for yarn as the result of market recession in the product sector in Europe.  Recent reports on the planned one week lay-off before Christmas are in line with the agreed programme of short-time working during 1998.  The plant will reopen in early January and every effort is being made by the parent company to rejuvenate its European sales levels and restore the plant to full working.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that labour intensive sectors, such as textiles, both in Ireland and throughout the EU are coming under increasing competitive pressures.  Companies operating in these sectors must adjust to the challenge by becoming more innovative if they are to survive and remain viable in an increasingly open and global marketplace. The various State development agencies, as well as FÁS, are actively assisting the textile industry to restructure and reposition and in this regard I am aware that Kilkenny Textile Mills was granted assistance under the EU RETEX programme, which was geared towards improving its competitive position.</P>
      <P>The House will realise that while the support agencies play an important role in helping industry to develop and expand, much depends on the external trading environment and the competitive intensity of the market segment in which the company positions itself.  I assure the Deputy that the development agencies have been made aware of our determination to focus to a much greater extent than in the past on the creation of new job opportunities in the regions.  I hope the strenuous campaign being mounted by the various agencies, both generally for the regions and more specifically for Kilkenny, will have positive results in the medium term.</P>
      <P>During the last year IDA Ireland developed a 50 acre sight in Kilkenny and the construction of a 25,000 square foot advance factory has commenced. In addition, planning permission has been obtained for the provision of a 20,000 square foot office facility for the promotion of internationally traded services companies.  Construction of the office facilities is planned to begin in January of next year.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland continues to emphasise the south-east region, including Kilkenny for new employment opportunities, for example, international services in addition to trading manufacturing.  I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland is working closely with Kilkenny Textile Mills to offer assistance wherever possible and it will keep me fully informed of developments.</P>

      <P>We have seen a remarkable development in recent days.  In many ways it is unique.  Yesterday the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the House that Deputy Blaney requested that the difficulties in Kerrykeel, County Donegal, be resolved.  He told the Minister if this did not happen he would not be prepared to attend the Dáil on the day in question.  Indeed, the Deputy went further and asked the Minister to assure him in writing that the installation of the antennae would never proceed. The Minister informed him that while he was prepared to take that position, he could not offer any guarantees in writing as other parties to the contract had contractual rights and would have to be consulted.</P>
      <P>These two positions are puzzling.  On the one hand, the Minister appears to have given a verbal guarantee.  I have no doubt he is a man of his word and that he would not give such a guarantee if he was not in a position to honour it.  On the other hand, he appears to imply that because there is a contract in existence, this verbal guarantee may not endure.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the scope and dimension of this verbal guarantee in the context of the contractual obligations which exist?  He indicated that the other party, Esat Digifone, would have to be consulted, which appears to be reasonable. Yet, there was no question of consultation in terms of the definitive, absolute guarantee which was given to Deputy Blaney, who put a remarkable degree of pressure on the Minister.  To be fair, the Minister was frank in acknowledging that yesterday when he said Deputy Blaney had indicated that he would not be in a position to attend the House on the day in question unless the matter was resolved and that this had a bearing on the matter.  It was a nice way of understating the pressure the Minister experienced.</P>
      <P>It appears the Minister has given a commitment that the contract will be broken.  Will he confirm the position and advise on the exact nature of the contractual arrangements between himself and Deputy Blaney and whether they will endure in the context of ensuring that the mast is not erected at the Garda station in Kerrykeel?  How can that be reconciled with Esat Digifone insisting that the mast should be erected?  Having heard what a spokesperson for Esat Digifone said on a radio programme one day this week, that is the position as I understand it.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister assessed the financial implications that would arise from breaking the contract that exists between his Department and the company?  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister is a distinguished lawyer, to what extent did he take legal advice on the position he took? To what degree did he take into account the legal aspects before he took this decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In replying to the matter raised by the Deputy, I will, of necessity, be somewhat repetitious because I dealt with this issue fully in my reply to the Private Notice Questions from Deputies Jim Higgins and Upton yesterday.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to firmly refute suggestions made by some in the House yesterday that my role in the events at Kerrykeel last week was, in any way, an interference in a Garda operational matter or was otherwise inappropriate.  It was the only reasonable and responsible course of action to take in the circumstances, given the potential that existed for serious conflict in Kerrykeel last Wednesday.  My responsibilities, not only as Minister but as one of the signatories to the Esat agreement, fully justified my intervention in events at Kerrykeel.  I did not undermine, in any way, the Garda Commissioner's operational independence.  It was and remains a matter for the Garda Commissioner to judge whether and in what circumstances Garda resources should be deployed when a breach of the peace is anticipated.  That most certainly does not mean it is inappropriate for the Minister of the day to do what he or she can to lower and ideally remove the concerns giving rise to the public order threat in the first place.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the implementation of a commercial contract.  As is the case with any such contract, it is perfectly legitimate where implementation difficulties arise for parties to pause, reflect and discuss.  That this should happen in no way compromises the operational independence of the Garda Commissioner.</P>
      <P>I wish to address directly the issue which Deputy Upton raised in a gracious way.  Last Wednesday morning I was asked if I would contact Deputy Blaney who was very concerned about actions which were under way to erect a new mast and install Esat antennae at Kerrykeel Garda station.  When I contacted Deputy Blayney, he explained to me that a large number of gardaí had arrived in Kerrykeel to ensure that the erection of the Garda mast and antennae would proceed that day.  A number of local residents were there intending to resist; there was considerable agitation and clearly the potential for conflict. Deputy Blaney requested that the matter be resolved and said that he did not propose to attend the Dáil that day unless he had an assurance that the erection of the mast and antennae would not proceed.  I informed the Deputy that I would make immediate inquiries and come back to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because conflict seemed likely, I contacted the Secretary General of my Department and asked him to convey my concerns to the Garda Commissioner and my view that action on the erection of the mast and antennae should be halted.  The Secretary General then spoke to the Garda Commissioner, who was aware of the controversy and was trying to assemble precise information about the developments at Kerrykeel.  As requested, the <Col N="452" /> Secretary General conveyed to the Commissioner my concerns that the work at Kerrykeel should be halted.  The end result was that local agreement on the erection of the Garda mast, which is essential for the maintenance of effective Garda communications, would stand, but the installation of the Esat antennae did not go ahead.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney asked me if I would assure him in writing that the installation of the antennae would never go ahead, and I told him that while I was prepared to take that position, I could not give any guarantee in writing, as there were other parties to the contract who had contractual rights and would naturally have to be consulted.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the House yesterday, the installation of masts at Kerrykeel is not the only case where concerns have been expressed to me.  I have had representations from public representatives, including Opposition Deputies, about the installation of Esat masts in other instances.  In one of these cases &mdash; at Maam &mdash; because of the particular circumstances applying, there was agreement that the erection of the Garda mast would proceed, with the installation of the Esat antennae being postponed pending further discussion.</P>
    <P>In my view, there was ample justification for intervention also in the case of Kerrykeel &mdash; against a background where I was informed that the potential for serious conflict existed.  To have done otherwise would have been irresponsible and would have left me open to genuine criticism in relation to the manner in which I discharge my responsibilities as Minister.</P>
    <P>It was not as if any of this could not have been foreseen.  On 27 February 1997 or thereabouts I categorically stated to the then Minister for Justice from the Opposition benches that it was desirable that there should be consultation with the public before matters regarding antennae and masts should proceed.  That is on the record.  That was my position then.  Events have been overtaken by the contract which was signed by the Minister for Justice and other members of the Government on 25 June 1997 when the Government was on its way out the door.  That is the legacy with which I was left and I am not sure whether it could be described as a very valuable heirloom.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to this matter.  He is committed to the development of schools and it is disappointing that I have to raise a matter such as this on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1996 the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, sanctioned a new school with four classrooms to replace the existing schools of Carrowreagh and Doocastle and allocated £250,000 for the project.  Since then numerous verbal promises have been given to the chairman and there was a visit from Dermot McCormack who met a number of the parents of the pupils.  To <Col N="453" /> date the parents have not seen any progress.  I have received a letter from the chairman of the board of management asking when the school will be completed and ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>Last week's <i>Sligo Champion</i> carried the headline &ldquo;South Sligo parents threaten boycott at rat-infested school&rdquo; and that is the main reason I raised this matter tonight.  It is very bad that such a headline should have been carried in a provincial newspaper in this technological age, having regard to what the Department is doing to promote education.  What is stated in that headline should not have to happen.  I am concerned about the condition of that school.  I am sure the Minister will give me assurances tonight and that we will be able to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>Furious parents, whose children are being taught in a rat-infested school, issued an ultimatum to the Minister, &ldquo;give us our new school or our children stay at home&rdquo;.  Those parents will withdraw up to 50 children unless they receive an assurance that work will commence on the long promised school next year.  This is the second time the parents have threatened to boycott the school, which has a leaking roof, plaster peeling off the walls and no indoor toilet facilities.  Conditions at the two teacher school are so cramped that when a remedial teacher visits she has to hold her class in a damp corridor.</P>
    <P>A start up date has been promised on four occasions, but each time the Department of Education and Science has employed delaying tactics. I am not saying those tactics were employed at the Minister's instigation.  The board of management and parents had hoped that work would start on the new school this year after planning permission was granted last July, but the latest news is that the project will not go to tender until the end of January.  They have been given so many promises that they have issued a letter which asks the Minister to prevent this boycott on 11 January by providing written confirmation of the timescale involved, the commencement date of the school building and the likely opening date of the new school.  That is why I consider it important to raise this matter before the Christmas recess.</P>
    <P>This issue has been ongoing for some time, but the Minister has been in office for more than 18 months.  The parents of the pupils of Carrowreagh school and the board of management want the Minister to categorically state in the House that work on the school building will commence next January.  I hope the Minister will give that assurance tonight.</P>
    <P>Another factor in the delay in commencing work on the building of the new school is the increased amount required in respect of the local contribution which has been collected over a number of years.  More local funding is required now than was required three to four years ago, another outcome of the delay in commencing work on the building of the new school.  Will the Minister provide written confirmation of the timescale involved, the commencement date for <Col N="454" /> building and a likely opening date for the school? This would prevent an unnecessary boycott on 11 January.  It is important that clarification is provided tonight and that this issue is settled before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me an opportunity to outline the current position regarding the proposed new building for Carrowreagh national school.</P>
      <P>Many projects were sanctioned in 1996 and money was not available for them.  That created a difficulty in catching up with the backlog.  The new building is being provided to facilitate an amalgamation of Carrowreagh National School and Doocastle National School.  At present the Carrowreagh National School has a staffing level of principal plus one assistant and an enrolment of 46.  Doocastle National School also has a staffing of principal plus assistant and has an enrolment of 19 pupils.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the poor condition of the school at Carrowreagh.  The local schools' inspector and my Department's building inspector have reported extensively on the poor condition of the building.  The renewal of substandard accommodation at primary school level is a major priority for this Government and I am making great progress on this issue.  I have ensured an increase in the capital allocation of 40 per cent for 1999 over the equivalent figure for 1998.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that my Department is working hard to ensure that construction will commence at the earliest opportunity in the new year.  The current position is that the tender documentation is being prepared.  I expect this will be finalised soon.  I will then take a decision on tender invitation.  Following receipt and examination of tenders, a suitable contractor will be appointed.  On a project of this size a contract period of nine months is normally allowed.</P>
      <P>Considering the number of stages involved, it is not realistic for me to give a definitive timescale for construction or a likely opening date for a new school.  I could do that but the Deputy has made the point that there have been many false dawns for this project.  My view on timescales and deadlines is to do as much as possible in terms of the work which must be done.  I assure the Deputy there will be no delays.  There is no reason for any delay.  The funding is in position so there is no reason for my officials to delay this because of lack of funds.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to ensure that progress on this project is expedited.  I am fully committed to ensuring that the school's accommodation problems are satisfactorily resolved, I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position.</P>

The money is there and that is the key.  We have to invite tenders and that takes time.  We are at the mercy of those who send in the tenders.  They are then examined and we make a decision and the project commences.  I guarantee we will work very hard to ensure the conditions at the schools will not have to be endured for much longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister for taking time out of a very busy schedule to be here tonight.</P>
      <P>The best way to illustrate my point is by way of example.  I recently had a visit from a constituent and his dilemma was heartrending.  He works in a local factory and receives a basic income. Two years ago his daughter went to England to train as a nurse.  To facilitate that he worked a great deal of overtime.  At the same time his son finished the leaving certificate.  Because there was shortage of cash in the house, the son took a year off and deferred entry to third level.  He worked for a year and saved £1,000.</P>
      <P>He then applied to college and was accepted.</P>
      <P>He applied for the maintenance grant but was told the family income was just too high.  The dilemma the family has is that all the money coming in is going out to keep the daughter in England and the son in college.  The £1,000 is gone.  The son had to pay for lodgings and books without any assistance.  The father came to see me and he was on the verge of tears.  He asked me what he would do.  He wanted his son to continue in third level where he is working very hard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is in first year at the moment. I have come across this many times.  We want to encourage young people to go into third level education, maximise their potential and do the best they can for themselves and for the economy. One way around this would be to graduate the maintenance grant rather than guillotining it at a certain point.  It would make more sense for families like this if it was eased down.  We would all like to increase the grants but this is a common problem.  Has the Minister any solution to this? Could this be addressed in time for next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other related issue is the cut off point for the non-adjacent grant.  The same guillotine exists in that area.  A person who lives a hundred yards from his friend may get a grant while the other <Col N="456" /> does not.  Perhaps the Minister will look at this and take some action on it as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I understand and empathise with the dilemma he has put before the House.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a grant operates on a graduated basis at present.  To qualify for a grant, a candidate's eligible income must be below the appropriate income limit which varies for the level of grant and in relation to the number of dependent children in the family.  Different limits apply where there are less than four dependent children, between four and seven dependent children, and eight or more dependants.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the new arrangements in 1992, the income limits were set by the number of dependent children, in excess of two and up to ten dependent children.  The income limits varied depending on whether a maintenance grant was payable and if so, whether it was payable at the adjacent or non-adjacent rate and depending on the rate of lecture fee grant payable. These arrangements were cumbersome and difficult for the local authorities to administer, while being extremely difficult for an individual candidate to understand.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements simplified the income limits, easing the administrative burden on the local authorities and making the system more comprehensible for candidates generally.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index for the period mid-February to mid-February next each year.  The inflation figure as provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent for the current academic year.</P>
      <P>The full maintenance grant for the current academic year has been increased to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £660 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures are provided by the Central Statistics Office and are computed in each case to March the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-9 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses has also been extended to include those family members attending a recognised PLC course, student nurse training or student Garda training, those participating in certain CERT courses and those attending full-time Teagasc courses in an agricultural college.  In the relevant cases the reckonable income limits may now be increased <Col N="457" /> by £2,060 where there are two such children, £4,120 where there are three and so on, by increments of £2,060.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that last week I announced an improvement in the grants scheme which will mean that mature students will receive a full grant for the first time.  This will cost £1.8 million per year.</P>
    <P>Further refinement to the present graduated system to provide tapering relief for candidates whose income exceeds the relevant limits would have implications for the administration of the schemes and would also involve the commitment of substantial additional resources.  In light of the overall resource constraints, I am obliged to have regard to the relative priority of all proposals for improvements and the many competing demands across the education system.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to review the situation.  It is an issue of trying to target the available resources to the students most in need.  The abolition of fees reduced our manoeuvrability in terms of what we can do with the grants system &mdash; there is no point <Col N="458" /> in denying that.  Over the past 15 months we concentrated, first, on the introduction of maintenance grants for PLC students, which cost £15 million to £16 million in a full year &mdash; this is the first year of operation.  Mature students got another quantum improvement, which will cost £1.8 million.</P>
    <P>I am looking at ways of doing something on the marginal side and to increase the hardship funds in the individual institutes of technology and universities. That would enable us to help those students who are in really desperate situations. There are very small hardship funds in the colleges at the moment.  The budget package for disadvantage allows me to increase the disadvantage funds I have at my disposal over this year, next year and the following year, which will give us more leeway to try to target those students who are very much in need and to allow them to continue their education.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the strategic management initiative sets out a wide ranging programme for change in the Civil Service. It is based on a number of key elements including regulatory reform, financial management changes and changes in relation to information technology.  Working groups were established in respect of these issues and these groups have now reported.  Their recommendations are being considered by the implementation group which is responsible for developing an integrated programme of change.</P>
      <P>The report of the working group on regulatory reform has now been considered by the implementation group which has set out a programme of action to help ensure that the level of regulation in the economy is appropriate.  I am currently finalising detailed proposals which I expect to be able to put to my colleagues in Government for decision early in 1999.</P>
      <P>As regards financial management, the recommendations of the working group will be considered by the implementation group at its meeting on 14 December and the group will then report to Government setting out a programme of action.  Again, I envisage Government consideration early in 1999.  As I indicated in my reply to questions on 14 October last, changes have already been introduced in the multi-annual budgeting and administrative budget aspects of financial management.</P>
      <P>Finally, a number of the recommendations contained in the SMI working group report on information technology have already been taken up in the work of the interdepartmental implementation group on the information society.  This group's report, which covers a wide range of issues including electronic Government, will be presented to Government shortly.  The remaining recommendations will be considered by the implementation group in January in the context of completing the SMI programme of action on information technology.  I expect that its report will be submitted to Government early in 1999.</P>

      <P>As we near the close of the Government's 1798 commemoration programme I am delighted, as chairperson of the commemoration committee, to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted, as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>It was my committee's intention to develop a broad ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the United Irishmen and the Fellowship of Freedom that inspired them in 1798.  With this in mind, it was felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  Projects such as the international conference, 1798 A Bicentenary Perspective, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Governments' 1798 commemoration scholarship and the RTE documentary series &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; are examples of projects funded which, I believe, duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
      <P>My committee was also happy to fund projects such as the Dublin/Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tone's diaries and the Drennan papers, the Humbert and Merriman Schools and the restoration of the William Lawless tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Ireland's film festival was a great success and the Glencree Peace Centre is continuing to develop its programme &lsquo;From Revolution to Reconciliation&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>The Croppies Acre Memorial Garden at Collins Barracks, which was opened by the Taoiseach on the 22 November, was developed in association with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Museum, and will serve as a lasting memorial to all those who died in 1798.  We can all agree that the 1798 centre at Enniscorthy, which I opened earlier this year, is a shining example of what can be done when State and local bodies work together with a single goal in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 exhibition will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
      <P>Many ceremonies have taken place over the last ten months to mark the Rebellion.  One such ceremony attended by the Taoiseach and involving the French military and our own Defence Forces took place in Ballina on 22 August to acknowledge France's involvement in 1798. Throughout the commemoration period funding has been made available at local level to many projects throughout the country.  Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, given the limited budget available, it was not possible to fund all the many worthy projects under way throughout the country and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the <Col N="461" /> local committees which worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank my committee for all its work in developing this broad ranging and inclusive 1798 programme of commemoration.</P>

      <P>Based on data collected for the compilation of the consumer price index, it is estimated that between August 1983 and September 1998 the average price of petrol increased by 15.8 per cent.  Over the same period average rail fares and bus fares increased by 39.8 per cent and 58.9 per cent respectively.</P>

      <P>Estimates for GDP per capita for the EU and its regions, expressed in purchasing power parities &mdash; PPPs &mdash; to allow for differences in price levels between member states, were received by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, from EUROSTAT by email on Wednesday afternoon, 18 November.</P>
      <P>These estimates incorporate the latest data supplied by the member states.  They showed that Ireland at 95 per cent of the EU average over the period 1994-6.  The conversion of the Irish estimates to a PPP basis is still the subject of discussion with EUROSTAT regarding some technical issues.  However, any resulting amendment is likely to be of a relatively minor nature, probably amounting to no more than 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 119 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The strength of the Air Corps on 30 September 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, was 1,011 personnel.  The Price Waterhouse report on the Air Corps recommends an overall strength of 930.  It is expected that 20 general service recruits will be enlisted in the Air Corps in the near future and I understand that proposals for the enlistment of a number of apprentice aircraft mechanics are being prepared by the military authorities.  An additional direct entry air traffic control officer is also expected to be appointed shortly.</P>
      <P>There are at present a total of 84 flying officers in the Air Corps.  Eleven Air Corps cadets were recruited in 1998.  There are also a total of seven senior cadets in their second year of training who are due to be commissioned as fully trained flying officers in 1999.  The ongoing training of cadets combined with the introduction of the service commitment scheme for Air Corps pilots which was introduced in 1997, is designed to help alleviate the difficulties in regard to pilot numbers which have arisen due to the unprecedented level of retirements from the Air Corps in the past year.</P>
      <P>The question of training non-commissioned personnel as pilots will also be further examined in the context of implementing the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report.  It is open to non-commissioned personnel to apply for Air Corps cadetships and a number of such personnel have been commissioned in the past having successfully completed cadetships.</P>

      <P>The Government, on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally.  The Government remains fully committed to this important programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks.  Sixty per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The amount paid in legal costs to date is £13 million in respect of 1,480 cases and where legal costs have so far been paid.  I should add that it can take some time before legal costs are actually paid out and, accordingly, there are a considerable number of settled cases where costs remain outstanding.</P>
      <P>The following costs generally apply to professional witnesses attending the High Court or Circuit Court: full days' attendance £447; standby fee, High Court, full day £223.50 and standby fee, Circuit Court £75.00. A fee of £500 to £600 is paid in respect of an engineer's or similar expert's report in the High Court with £400 being allowed in the Circuit Court.  Actuarial reports can range from £200 to £700.</P>
      <P>In cases where the fees being charged appear to be excessive, it is the practice of the Chief State Solicitor to apply to the Taxing Master of the court for an adjudication in relation to the amounts.</P>

      <P>The apprentice school came into operation in 1956 at a time when there was no formal training for apprentices available elsewhere.  At the height of its operations up to 60 apprentices were recruited each year with each apprentice spending three years in the school resulting in the school accommodating up to 180 apprentices.</P>
      <P>In recent years the need to recruit apprentices for the Defence Forces has reduced considerably and it is not anticipated that there will be any major change in this regard.  At present there are only 28 apprentices in the school.  Because of the high fixed overhead associated with the school, the cost soared to £100,000 per pupil per year. This was clearly unsustainable.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to complete the training of the existing 28 apprentices.  The apprentices have already been accommodated at the Curragh Camp.  The carpenter, electrician and motor mechanic apprentices are undergoing on the job training which is part of their normal training programme in accordance with the FÁS syllabus. The communication information services technicians are receiving technical training and are also undergoing military training.</P>
      <P>Of the staff of approximately 70, all have been redeployed to the Curragh except for the ten civilian teachers.  A number of meetings have been held involving the teachers, their union the TUI, their employer the Kildare VEC and the Department of Defence and Education and Science. Negotiations are addressing the completion of the classroom and workshop training of the apprentices and the future of the teachers.</P>
      <P>Military personnel previously based in Devoy Barracks, Naas have already relocated to the Curragh Camp, and some of these personnel continue to be involved in the training of the apprentices. Devoy Barracks has been fully evacuated and the buildings have been secured.  A substantial programme of improvements to the apprentices' living accommodation has been completed in the Curragh Camp.  A further programme of building work will be undertaken in the coming months to develop workshops and technical training facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Austrian Minister for Defence I attended a meeting of Defence Ministers of the member states of the European Union in Vienna on 3 and 4 November 1998.  I was accompanied by my private secretary, an assistant secretary from my Department and a senior official from the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The invitation from the Austrian Minister was extended in September of this year.  Austria currently holds the Presidency of the EU.  The meeting, a once-off and informal event, was nondecision making in character and was held outside the institutional framework of the EU.  No decisions or conclusions were reached and no final document was, therefore, produced. Defence Ministers of all the 15 EU member states, including the EU neutral states, attended as well as the Secretary General of the Western European Union, Western European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> Discussions focused primarily on the development perspectives of European peacekeeping and crisis management with particular emphasis on the practical effect of the inclusion of the Petersberg Tasks in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  This reflected a recognition that the need to prevent, manage and resolve conflicts, such as those that have occurred in the former Yugoslavia, is the current key security challenge facing the UN and the international community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I found this an area of great interest and, indeed, importance for Ireland in view of our strong commitment to European integration and in consequence of our long history of support for peacekeeping operations.  These two fundamental concepts are brought together in Ireland's readiness to contribute to Petersberg Tasks on a voluntary and case-by-case basis, as is our right in accordance with our observer status at the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>On the basis of our voluntary and long peace-keeping experience, Ireland is ready to make a continuing contribution to strengthening the international community's conflict prevention and crisis management capabilities and I made this known during the course of the meeting. Indeed, Ireland has, along with our fellow neutral EU member states, and many other non-NATO states, moved into a new dimension of regional peacekeeping through our participation in the Stabilisation Force in Bosnia, SFOR.  I found that the Vienna meeting provided a timely opportunity to share experiences in the peacekeeping area with those of other countries with which we have much in common.</P>
    <P>A success of the Treaty of Amsterdam is that it maintained a unified approach in relation to the common foreign and security policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; in that all member states, including the EU neutrals, could participate in Petersberg Tasks. Ireland considers it important that the EU should seek to implement the new provisions on peace-keeping and crisis management which were the result of lengthy negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference leading up to the Treaty.</P>
    <P>It can be said with some certainty that the Balkan conflict and the lessons drawn from the recent terrible events in the former Yugoslavia were the backdrop to the Treaty of Amsterdam and the treaty's provision in relation to the Petersberg Tasks were aimed at giving the EU capacity to deal more effectively with this type of crisis.  As I said earlier, Ireland has indicated willingness to contribute to Petersberg Tasks on a voluntary and case-by-case basis.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from what I have outlined, the focus of the meeting was very firmly in the area of peacekeeping and crisis management.  My contribution to the discussions was in that context.  I was pleased to have had the opportunity to contribute to the meeting and to indicate Ireland's approach to the issues raised.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any plans for further meetings of this nature.</P>

      <P>The restructuring and reorganisation of the Permanent Defence Force is proceeding in accordance with the recommendations of the Defence Forces review implementation plan which was approved by Government in March 1996.  On 1 October 1998 Defence Forces headquarters was established in the Department of Defence and replaces the three military branches that had existed in the Department.  The Army component of the Permanent Defence Force was reorganised on 1 November 1998 and now comprises three Army brigades, a Defence Forces training centre, a logistics base and some other elements such as the Equitation School and the Defence Forces School of Music.</P>
      <P>It is to be expected that the reorganisation of the Defence Forces will have some implications for the membership in the same way that restructuring and/or reorganisation in any organisation in the public or private sector has implications for the staff of such organisations.  However, in the Defence Forces every effort is being made to ensure that a minimum number of personnel are inconvenienced as little as possible by the ongoing reorganisation.  With regard to the deployment of personnel, it is envisaged that, as far as possible, all personnel will be facilitated to the greatest extent possible.</P>
      <P>Six military barracks were selected for closure which has resulted in units and personnel stationed in these barracks being relocated in the nearest barracks.  At the present time, no further barrack closures are under consideration.</P>

      <P>The issue of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace was set out by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his reply to a question in the House on 5 November last and also in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday, 28 November 1998.  I understand he also gave a written reply to questions in the House yesterday.  I concur fully with his views in relation to PfP.</P>
      <P>The Government's intention at this stage is to try to enhance understanding and informed discussion of PfP and also to move that discussion away from the polarised views which have developed and grown around the issue in recent times.  I see this as an entirely sensible and appropriate approach to the matter at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the possible future role for the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities under <Col N="472" /> PfP, participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of PfP.  These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the protection and promotion of human rights, the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace, the preservation of democracy, the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the objectives of the UN charter and OSCE commitments. In addition, individual states decide on the scope and extent of its participation in PfP activities and, in this regard, agree an individual partnership programme covering the activities to which it wishes to subscribe.</P>
    <P>In Ireland's case, should we decide at any time in the future to join PfP, it is envisaged that these activities would include peacekeeping under a UN mandate, humanitarian and rescue, etc, tasks in line with our traditional involvement and experience in these areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 75 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence and the Chief State Solicitor's office had correspondence and a number of meetings earlier this year with the Law Society and with some of the individual solicitors concerned.</P>
      <P>The general purpose of our communications was to examine the level of legal fees and whether economies, particularly in the case of those firms of solicitors who are acting for a large number of plaintiffs in similar cases, could be achieved.  With regard to the question of fees, I was told that the solicitors concerned were already substantially discounting fees in these cases.  I remain convinced that there is further room for reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If and when a lower and more acceptable tariff in these cases is achieved allowing me to establish a non-court system of compensation, I will press for further discounts in the level of legal fees charged in these cases.  In the meantime the State is in discussion with a number of solicitors to establish whether it is possible to achieve block <Col N="473" /> settlements at reasonable rates.  These discussions also include the issue of reduced legal fees.</P>
    <P>In any case where fees appear inordinate, the Chief State Solicitor applies to the taxing master of the High Court for an adjudication,</P>

      <P>The framework for negotiations with the representative associations, including PDFORRA, is set out in the conciliation and arbitration scheme to which both associations and the Department subscribe. This scheme also sets out the range of subjects which come within the scope of representation.</P>
      <P>The successful operation of the scheme requires both sides to adopt a realistic and constructive attitude.  In any industrial relations forum, tensions may arise if either side approaches the negotiating table with unobtainable expectations on issues which fall outside the parameters of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
      <P>I welcome the call by the president of PDFORRA, on closing this year's conference, that both sides look to the future in resolving outstanding issues.  I believe that the new conciliation and arbitration scheme negotiated as part of the recent pay agreement and the opportunities presented by the Partnership 2000 agreement will enable future negotiations take place in a spirit of understanding and trust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 45 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for internal security rests with the Garda Síochána.  The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required.  This entails assisting the gardaí at roadblocks, checkpoints and searches including in the Border area. The Defence Forces also assist the gardaí in relation to prisoner escorts, cash escorts and explosives escorts.</P>
      <P>The demands on the Defence Forces in relation to Border duty depend on the nature of the requests for assistance received from the Garda at any particular time.  Currently, these requests include the provision of armed parties in aid of the civil power for the purpose of protecting gardaí and the carrying out of such duties as vehicle checkpoints and mobile security patrols, specialist search team tasks and explosive ordnance disposal tasks.  The Defence Forces continue to respond to requests from the gardaí in relation to Border security and other operations.</P>
      <P>The comments made by the Chief of Staff at the recent RACO conference relating to the aid to the civil power role are, I believe, expressions of genuine concern regarding the need for a new training regime to update the skills of the members of the Permanent Defence Force to equip them for the range of tasks which they undertake.  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces will continue to maintain ability to respond, at short notice, to any requests from the Garda for aid to the civil power.</P>
      <P>The question of the level of demand on the Defence Forces in aid of the Garda in the Border area following on the British-Irish Agreement will be kept under review in my Department in consultation with the relevant Government Departments as well as with the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced recently the result of the first stage of a competition to provide armoured personnel carriers for the Defence Forces.  More than 30 prospective suppliers world wide had expressed interest in the procurement programme and proposals were received from 12 companies.  The proposals were evaluated and assessed by a civilian-military project team which was established to manage the entire procurement process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two vehicles have now been selected to go forward to the next stage of the competition having <Col N="475" /> complied fully with the initial technical specification in which protection of troops was given high priority.  The successful proposals were submitted by Mowag of Switzerland who manufacture the Piranha APC and Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Austria who manufacture the Pandur APC.  The two suppliers selected will shortly be asked to prepare formal tenders on the basis of a more detailed specification.</P>
    <P>A contract is expected to be in place in the first half of 1999 for the supply of up to 40 APCs over five years, with the first APC delivered late next year.  The purchase of modern APCs is regarded by the Defence Forces as the most urgent equipment requirement to enable them to carry out all the roles assigned by Government.  One of the priorities in the Action Programme for the Millennium is to &ldquo;equip the Defence Forces adequately for an expanded role in international peacekeeping&rdquo;.  The APC procurement forms an integral part of an ongoing re-equipment programme.</P>

      <P>Details of the approximate cost to the State in the past year of the Reserve Defence Force is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil provides training for volunteer personnel to meet a local defence role which enables its units to provide military security in their own areas and relieve units of the Permanent Defence Force in those areas should circumstances so require.  An Slua Muirí, which is the Naval component of the Reserve Defence Force, trains personnel to assist the Naval Service in seaward defence, port control and examination of vessels.  In addition, members of the Reserve Defence Force are occasionally employed on security duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the Defence Forces restructuring and reorganisation process, a special study of the Reserve Defence Force, which consists of the First Line Reserve, the FCA and the Slua Muirí, is taking place at present.  In that regard, there is a consultative process in train which is intended to elicit the views of serving members on the <Col N="477" /> future development of the organisation.  The representative bodies are also involved in this process. The role of the Reserve Forces and their equipment are being examined as part of this special study.  It is anticipated that the study of the Reserve Defence Force will be completed in early 1999.</P>
    <P>The cost of the reserve in 1997, which is approximately £24.9 million includes a figure of £18.4 million approximately, expended on the pay, allowances, etc., of members of the Permanent Defence Force engaged in the training and administration of the reserve.</P>
    <P>An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí, which form the Second Line Reserve, are voluntary organisations and in the circumstances the commitment and dedication of their members cannot be commended too highly.  The contribution of members of the Reserve Forces to the community is considerable and is recognised and valued throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 72, 80 and 160 together.</P>
      <P>The Government on 15 July 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. This decision is part of the relocation, refurbishment and re-equipment of the Defence Forces, as recommended in the Price Waterhouse report regarding the rationalisation of military installations generally.</P>
      <P>Following the Government decision, I had consultations with public and community representatives in each of the five locations in which barracks were recently evacuated.  There are also ongoing discussions between officials of my Department and officials of the relevant local authorities.  It is expected that up to £50 million will be raised from the sale of the barracks.  Sixty per cent of the proceeds will be invested in the redevelopment of other military installations and new equipment.  The balance will be used both to meet the cost of compensation claims and for investment in the local communities where closures take place.</P>
      <P>The proposed sales will provide sites to meet housing, commercial and industrial development needs in the areas concerned.  In addition, 15 per cent of the proceeds are to be devoted to community projects in the areas involved.  In this regard, I have invited community groups to submit their proposals regarding the utilisation of those funds and for the future development of the lands to ensure that the maximum possible benefit accrues to the local communities.  I await their reports with interest.</P>

      <P>There is agreement in principle on the introduction of a pilot scheme under which up to eight civilian patients would be accommodated in St. Bricin's for periods ranging from seven to ten days.  Some preparatory work has already been carried out in St. Bricin's in anticipation of the implementation of this project.</P>
      <P>It was recognised by all parties involved that certain issues regarding liability to compensation claims, and the status of patients would have to be resolved before the pilot scheme could commence. Also, the question of the statutory basis for using a military hospital for the accommodation and treatment of civilian patients has arisen.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 70, 73, 74, 106 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>Having considered the report of Price Waterhouse Management Consultants on the review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, the Government decided that the future development of both the Air Corps and the Naval Service critically depends on the input of all of the relevant stakeholders.  Given the cross-departmental nature of the State's air and sea requirements, key stakeholders include the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources as well as the Department of the Taoiseach and my own Department.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Defence, I am ultimately responsible for the development of the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  The task of putting together the necessary plans to give effect to the Government's decision on the recommendations made by Price Waterhouse will be addressed as a priority by the civil and military branches of my Department.</P>
      <P>There are two broad dimensions to this work. First, there is the need to address the military capability requirements to be comprehended within the White Paper on defence which were not dealt with in the consultants' report.  Second, there is a range of effectiveness and efficiency recommendations for implementation in order to ensure that the taxpayer obtains the best air and sea services possible.  It will, in the final analysis, be the task of the General Officer Commanding, Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding, Naval Service to present plans for my consideration to address all these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I have recently instructed the Chief of Staff to initiate, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, the necessary process to address these matters.  It is my aim to ensure that plans for the effectiveness and efficiency measures can be finalised early in the new year.  Detailed issues, including the future <Col N="483" /> equipping of the Air Corps and the Naval Service and the location of the headquarters of both services, will be considered within these plans.  This work is now under way.</P>
    <P>My colleagues in Government are participating in the consultation group which was set up to provide a forum for external stakeholders to make their input to the planning process with a view to ensuring that both services are meeting the needs of these clients.  The group is made up of senior civil and military officers, including the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service and is tasked with making relevant inputs to the planning process leading to the finalisation of implementation plans to give effect to the Government's decision as outlined already.  I am chairing this group, which recently held its first meeting. The group will meet as required by the need to ensure that both services take cognisance of the requirements of client organisations in the planning process.</P>
    <P>The re-equipping and reorganisation of the Army has already been addressed under the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan 1996-8, and its ongoing development will be addressed further in the White Paper process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government considered my proposals for the preparation of the proposed White Paper on Defence in late July and approved the following objectives for the White Paper: to provide a medium term policy framework within which defence policy can evolve to set out a clear strategy for the next ten years; to provide a framework to include the input of the Minister for Foreign Affairs deriving from the overall international security context and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with regard to the national security environment; to provide for the continuation of the reform programme, already commenced under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, of defence services especially in relation to the future size, configuration, deployment and resourcing &mdash; financial, infrastructural and equipment &mdash; of the Defence Forces consistent with the national and international security environment and the state of the public finances; to ensure that the ongoing development of the management of defence services is in accordance with the evolution of the strategic management initiative centrally; and to provide a medium term programme for the evolution of civil defence policy and as a follow-up to the present Towards 2000 strategy.</P>
      <P>The necessary work required by the Government's decision on the White Paper is proceeding. This is based on the work of my own Department, civil and military, as well as appropriate inputs from other Ministers, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In mid-August, notices were placed in the <Col N="485" /> national daily newspapers inviting submissions on any or all aspects of the White Paper from interested individuals and organisations, with a closing date of 16 October.  In cases where an individual or organisation has indicated to me that preparation of a submission is well in hand, I am prepared to accept these up to the end of this month.  When all submissions received have been considered, arrangements will be made to meet key stakeholders, such as the Defence Forces representative associations.</P>
    <P>As this is the first White Paper of its kind, I have made it clear from the outset that adequate time should be provided for its preparation.  I wish to ensure that all issues raised are reflected upon adequately.  The timetable for this work is provisional but I would see the ongoing consultations being undertaken over the coming months with the intention of being in a position to put a draft for consideration by the Government by the summer of next year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, important decisions in the defence area are proceeding in relation to.  for example, barracks rationalisation, the ongoing reorganisation of the Defence Forces under the Defence Forces review implementation plan, the Air Corps and Naval Service reviews and, of course, the need to tackle the hearing loss compensation issue.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, 1996-1998 was adopted by Government in February 1996.  The reorganisation process is continuing and the first phase of the implementation plan will be substantially completed by the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>I am very, satisfied with the overall reorganisation process thus far.  Last week, the third and final phase of the scheme of voluntary early retirement for PDF personnel concluded.  In October the organisation for Defence Force headquarters came into place and in November, the new Army structure, comprising three brigades and the Defence Forces training centre, was introduced.  In addition, in the past six months the report of the studies of the Air Corps and Naval</P>
      <P>Service has been published, the Defence Act, 1954 has been amended and the Government has approved the closure of a number of military barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The momentum for reform of the Defence Forces will continue by means both of the implementation plans for the reorganisation of the Air Corps and Naval Service, which are currently <Col N="486" /> being drawn up, and through the White Paper on defence which will be completed next year.</P>
    <P>I am looking forward to receiving the report of the steering group for the study of the Reserve early next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, is establishing the Kosovo verification mission, KVM, on the basis of an agreement signed by the chairman in office of that organisation and the Foreign Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 16 October 1998.  UN Security Council Resolution 1203 of 24 October 1998 endorsed and supported the agreement and urged states to make personnel available to the mission.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Government decided to allow up to 30 members of the Permanent Defence Force to participate in the mission.  Five military officers are being deployed immediately to key positions in the planning and support unit of the KVM.  It is anticipated that the remainder of the personnel will be deployed to the mission early in the new year at which stage OSCE selection procedures are expected to be completed.</P>
      <P>At my request, four military personnel visited Honduras between 26 November 1998 and 2 December 1998 on a fact finding mission to ascertain what humanitarian assistance could be rendered by the Defence Forces over a short timeframe in the wake of the destruction caused by hurricane Mitch.  A report on the visit is being studied in my Department at present in consultation with the military authorities with a view to assessing what assistance, if any, could be given. It is envisaged that military personnel would be seconded with pay to a non-governmental agency.</P>

      <P>As regards liaison with the Naval Service, that service currently responds to calls for assistance from IMES in marine emergency situations.  The Naval Service is also represented on the marine emergency advisory group which comprises senior officers of the maritime and land based emergency services and also on the Irish marine search and rescue committee.  The latter is a standing consultative committee representing the providers and users of the search and rescue services.</P>

      <P>Civil and military officials of my Department have met formally with representatives of PDFORRA on seven occasions since the association's annual delegate conference.  These meetings are in addition to numerous less formal contacts and telephone conversations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that agreement has recently been reached with PDFORRA on improved pay arrangements for the ranks of the PDF represented by the association.  In return for the improvements in remuneration, the association has agreed to complete the discussions on the rationalisation of the duties attracting the payment of security duty allowance.  I am anxious that these discussions be brought to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent agreement with PDFORRA also included acceptance by the association of the terms of the Partnership 2000.  Aside from its pay element, Partnership 2000 represents a new departure in employer-employee relationships. <Col N="489" /> This is an area which I wish to explore further with the representative associations with a view to arriving at arrangements which meet the needs of both the organisation and the associations' members.  Successful organisational change must be based on a partnership approach to change and to problem solving.  The objective of the partnership approach is to achieve joint ownership of the process by both official and staff sides.</P>
    <P>Building a partnership structure in the Defence Forces will present unique challenges.  The joint task of official and staff sides is to build on our existing arrangements such as the conciliation and arbitration scheme and to develop a new partnership forum where a broader range of issues can be addressed.  Members of both staff and official sides recently participated in a seminar on partnership which I hope is the start of a new and more open process.</P>

The same selection procedures apply to Air Corps officers as to other volunteers for service with UN missions and there are no plans to change the policy in this regard.  However the high incidence of retirement of Air Corps middle ranking officers in recent years has not permitted the selection of Air Corps officers for overseas service at the level of earlier years.  Approximately 20 of the line officers currently serving with the Air Corps have served overseas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member <Col N="490" /> of the European Union.  The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  Other roles carried out by the Naval Service, generally in support of other Government Departments, include search and rescue operations, aid to the civil power, drugs interdiction at sea, salmon fishery patrols and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At present, six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit.  A new fishery protection patrol vessel &mdash; FPPV &mdash; is currently under construction and is due to be delivered in September 1999.</P>
    <P>Following the Government's consideration of the Price Waterhouse review of the Air Corps and the Naval Service, a planning process is now in place to give effect to the Government's decision in the matter.  There are two broad dimensions to this work.  First, there is the need to address the military capability requirements to be comprehended within the White Paper on defence which were not dealt with in the consultants' report.  Second, there is a range of effectiveness and efficiency recommendations for implementation in order to ensure that the taxpayer obtains the best air and sea services possible.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I have recently instructed the Chief of Staff to initiate, in conjunction with the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service, the necessary process to address these matters.  It is my aim to ensure that plans for the effectiveness and efficiency measures can be finalised early in the new year.  Following the first meeting of the special consultation group which was set up to facilitate the input of the key stakeholders to the implementation planning process and which I chair, I have asked the key stakeholders including the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources to make their input in relation to the services, including fishery protection, which they require.</P>

      <Col N="491" /> The condition of young officers' living accommodation is kept under review and refurbishment and routine maintenance are undertaken as circumstances require and the availability of resources permits.  Proposals to improve officer accommodation in Collins Barracks, Cork, and in Connolly Barracks, Curragh, are under consideration and I am hopeful that it will be possible for arrangements to be made to commence both projects before the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached with both Permanent Defence Force representative associations on the establishment of a revised conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the PDF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various concerns had been expressed about the traditional model of conciliation and arbitration schemes in the public service, including the PDF.  These concerns included an over reliance on comparability, an over dependence on an arbitrator acting alone, an adversarial approach, a lack of transparency and the absence of any apparent linkage between special pay increases and productivity.  The recent pay discussions with both associations was an opportune time to review the situation and to consider methods of pay determination which will apply in the future.  Many of these issues have been addressed in the new scheme which will provide <Col N="492" /> a more transparent and realistic system and which will place greater emphasis on constructive negotiation rather than adjudication to resolve issues.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this new conciliation and arbitration scheme, together with the opportunities afforded by the new partnership approach, provides adequate facilities for the associations to raise issues of concern to them.  A copy of the new scheme will be forwarded to the Deputy within the coming days.</P>

      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.</P>
      <P>Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  Other activities carried out by the Naval Service from time to time in support of other Government Departments, include search and rescue operations, aid to the civil power, salmon fishery patrols and assistance with oil pollution control at sea.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners. During the course of routine fishery protection patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti-drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal <Col N="495" /> importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has also increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in the area of drug interdiction.</P>

      <P>The case in question was Michael Smith <i>v</i> Minister for Defence and Others, which was originally heard in February 1997, when the plaintiff was awarded £20,000 by the High Court.  It was the State's case on appeal, that it had been found that the plaintiff had normal hearing for a man of his age; that there was no evidence that he had above normal hearing prior to exposure to noise from gunfire; and, that even if he had suffered some loss of hearing that this loss was not of an extent to warrant compensation.</P>
      <P>I was clearly pleased that the court upheld the State's appeal and referred the matter back to the High Court.  I was also pleased with the view expressed by the court that just because a person has been in the Army and has been exposed to gunfire noise without ear protection does not mean that a person is automatically entitled to damages.</P>
      <P>While this judgment will not resolve the Army hearing loss issue, I am nonetheless interpreting it as being favourable to the Government's position. I hope that the Supreme Court judgment would be particularly noted by persons who think there is compensation due to them just because they have served with the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Smith case of itself will not impact on the overall cost, which I conservatively estimate at £550 million and which is the subject of other questions today.  The Hanley test case, on which this estimate is based, is also under appeal and I understand it will be heard in April next.</P>

      <P>The question of the number and locations of Defence Forces barracks is not one which comes within the remit of the representative associations.  It is a matter for Government to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> However, following a decision to close a barracks there is an important role for the associations in identifying issues of concern to their members.  The issues which can be considered jointly with the associations are the management of the closures and the associated personnel matters. It was always accepted that both associations had a legitimate role to play in this area with a need for ongoing consultation during the planning and transfer period.  This was made very clear to them at the time of the announcement of barrack closures.</P>
    <P>Arrangements were made for the local representatives to be briefed on the work of the military project teams on barrack closures.  An overall briefing for the association officials was also arranged.  These arrangements provided an opportunity for the associations to raise and address the concerns of their members.</P>
    <P>It is universally accepted that barrack closures were necessary to remove from the Defence Forces the intolerable burden imposed by manning and maintaining unnecessary installations. RACO itself appreciates the necessity to effect closures.  This point was reiterated publicly by the association's representatives at the recent ADC. The closures will release troops for operational duties and they will provide resources to improve the infrastructure of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The barrack closure issue was ignored by successive Administrations for the last 20 years.  I very much regret this.  While my decision on this matter may not be popular with everyone, as Minister, I was not prepared to take the easy way out and let the <i>status quo</i> continue.  This would have been unfair and would have proved a major stumbling block in the ongoing reform of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>The mission of the Army Equitation School, as assigned to it on its establishment in 1926, is to advertise the Irish non-thoroughbred horse.  The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years.  Through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.</P>
      <P>The school has, down the years, provided horses and riders of the highest quality for Irish international show jumping teams and, while acknowledging the contribution of individual civilian riders, the Army riders have been a consistent feature of international teams over many years.  Army riders have also participated with distinction in Olympic Games, most recently at Seoul in 1988 and Los Angeles in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The Equitation School has, at present, two horses which are competing at international level and which are expected to be suitable for consideration for selection for the Sydney Olympics in the year 2000.  The selection of horses for the Irish team travelling to Sydney will be made by the International Committee of the Showjumping Association of Ireland in the period leading up to the commencement of the games.</P>
    <P>My Department continues to source high quality Irish bred horses for the Army Equitation School for competition at home and abroad and I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses continue to be acquired by the school in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.  Funding for the Army Equitation School is currently provided from the national lottery.  There is a total allocation of £550,000 available this year which includes a provision of £260,000 in respect of the purchase of horses.  I am committed to maintaining funding at existing levels in the coming year and also to continue to explore possibilities to ensure that horses of the appropriate standard will be available to the Equitation School for possible selection on an Irish showjumping team which, it is hoped, will travel to Sydney in the year 2000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised by the Deputy were examined during the EAG review of the Irish Naval Service and Air Corps, and will be further considered, both in the context of the implementation plans <Col N="498" /> for the reorganisation of the Naval Service and the Air Corps as well as part of the general White Paper process.</P>

      <P>Agreement has recently been reached with both PDF representative associations on the application to them of the provisions of the Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness. Arrangements have been made for payment of the appropriate general increases, including any arrears, and the remaining increases will be paid as they fall due.</P>
      <P>The Partnership 2000 provides for a new departure in employer-employee relationships with successful organisational change being based on a partnership approach to change and to problem solving.  The civil and military branches of the Department and both PDF associations are committed to this approach.  I am anxious that partnership arrangements with both PDF associations would be arrived at as quickly as possible and that those arrangements would meet the needs of both the organisation and the associations' members.</P>
      <P>A requirement of the Partnership 2000 is action to modernise the public service.  On the civil side of the Department and in common with all other Government Departments, as agreed at general council of the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme, a staff/management partnership committee, chaired by the Secretary General, has been established in the Department of Defence to address joint ownership of the change management process.</P>
      <P>Where the Defence Forces are concerned, this modernisation programme involves a restructuring and reorganisation of the Forces.  The first phase of the process is set out in the Defence Forces review implementation plan.  This implementation plan is, however, merely the first of a series which will be implemented over a ten year period.</P>
      <P>All sides are committed to the partnership concept and I do not anticipate any difficulty in meeting the terms of the P2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 120 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners while the main day to day role of the Naval Service <Col N="500" /> is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  During the course of routine patrols Naval Service vessels may be deployed to anti drug smuggling operations. Naval Service vessels are specifically tasked from time to time to carry out drug search and interdiction operations in aid of the civil authorities.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to taskings involving the prevention of illegal drug importation. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>Since the formation of the aforementioned joint task force the Naval Service has been involved in 19 drug interdiction missions.  These missions involved the Naval Service operating either in conjunction with the Garda or the Customs Service, or both.  Apart from the direct involvement of the Naval Service in drug interdiction missions at sea, Naval Service officers have been called on from time to time to assist the Garda and the Customs Service using their particular expertise in naval service marine engineering, and diving capabilities.  Army personnel have also provided assistance in drug interdiction missions on occasions.</P>
    <P>The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, has increased the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in the area of drug interdiction.  The strength of the Naval Service is kept under constant review in the light of operational requirements.  Eighty four recruits have been enlisted in the service to date in 1998 and arrangements are in hand for the enlistment of an additional 36 recruits.  Seventeen apprentices are also being, recruited.  Twelve cadets are at present undergoing training with the Naval Service and, in addition, nine watchkeeping officers have taken up appointment with the executive branch of the service.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service is equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying vessel, four off shore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  At present six vessels are operational and one is undergoing refit.  In December 1997 a contract was placed for the supply of a new fishery protection patrol vessel which is due to be delivered in September, 1999.</P>

      <P>It is not generally the practice for the State to call an acoustics expert to give evidence in hearing compensation cases as it normally concedes that unprotected exposure to gunfire noise may cause high tone hearing loss.</P>
      <P>Expert evidence on behalf of the State is usually provided by the ear, nose and throat specialist who examined the plaintiff or by appropriate military specialists, such as Army medical officers.</P>

For this reason, the CSO has been proactive in inviting feedback from field staff engaged on the census with a view to making continuous improvements in subsequent censuses.  The proposals put forward by the person concerned will be considered in the context of the next census and will be taken into account to the extent that they are deemed to be reasonable and achievable in practice.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that senior census staff have on different occasions over the past few years dealt directly with the person concerned it is not considered that any further consultations are warranted.</P>

      <P>A social economy working group was set up on foot of the commitment in Partnership 2000 &ldquo;to undertake a detailed examination of the potential of the social economy&rdquo;, in the context that &ldquo;appropriate support mechanisms to facilitate the achievement of the full potential of the social economy will be established, in the light of recommendations of the working group&rdquo;.  The four social partner pillars, relevant Government Departments, FÁS and Area Development Management <Col N="502" /> Limited were represented on this working group, which met from October 1997 to July 1998.</P>
      <P>There are ten recommendations concerning the future development of the social economy, including the introduction of a social economy programme with dedicated financial and institutional supports, in the final report of the working group.  It recommended that funding for the social economy programme be sourced primarily through a reallocation of funding currently committed to community employment and that it should be managed at national and local level by FÁS, in partnership with relevant interest groups.</P>
      <P>I have fully accepted and have started to implement the recommendations, contained in the final report of this working group, concerning the introduction of a dedicated social economy programme. There is provision in my Department's 1999 Estimate for additional Exchequer resources of £1 million to assist social economy enterprises and I will shortly be inviting the four pillars of the social partnership to nominate representatives to the national monitoring committee.  I envisage that this monitoring committee will be established early in 1999.  I want this committee to have a central developmental role in the social economy programme from the outset.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee will oversee the phased introduction of the new programme which may prove to be a relatively complex task.  Practical guidelines concerning the operation of local working arrangements between FÁS and local relevant interest groups, including partnerships, must be agreed by this monitoring committee.  It will also have a central role in advising my Department and</P>
      <P>FÁS on how the phased transition from existing community employment projects to new social economy enterprises can best be handled.</P>

      <P>A copy of Senator Henry's report has been made available to me by the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. The report outlines the challenges faced by the retail and distribution sectors.  In common with business generally, these sectors must adapt to market forces and the report acknowledges that the changes taking place, particularly in relation to distribution, were happening irrespective of the arrival of the major UK multiples in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Steps have already been taken to assist Irish companies to respond to the challenges and to exploit new opportunities through the supplier development programme administered by Enterprise Ireland.  In addition, the commitments given by Tesco regarding the purchase of Irish products continue to be monitored by my Department and Enterprise Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by RGDATA and IBEC in relation to the retail grocery trade.</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 prevents below cost selling in the retail grocery trade and it is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The competition and mergers review group established by my predecessor is reviewing competition and mergers legislation. Both RGDATA and IBEC have made submissions to the group.  The review of the groceries order, particularly the below cost selling aspects of the order, is included as part of the terms of reference of the group.</P>
      <P>I look forward to receiving the report of the competition and mergers review group and I will consider the recommendations made therein.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the Office of Fair Trade recently produced a report which calls for a full inquiry into the profitability of the large grocery multiples in the United Kingdom.  From inquiries I have made, I understand that Irish suppliers are not experiencing difficulties in supplying UK grocery multiples. However, the relevant agencies, An Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland, are keeping the matter under review.  As the Deputy is aware, any action which might be open to me in this situation would have to take account of EU competition policy in the context of the European single market.</P>

      <P>The ESRI benchmarking study was commissioned by An Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland in association with Tesco to identify the level of Irish sourced products by the former Quinnsworth/Crazy Prices chain. Tesco, who have primary ownership of the study, have indicated that they do not wish to have the results published as this would entail disclosing commercially sensitive information.  I wish to assure Deputy Owen, however, that the commitments given by Tesco to purchase Irish products are being monitored by my Department and Enterprise Ireland.</P>

      <P>The proposals put forward by the Deputy would involve a radical change in the approach to fisheries organisation and managements; at both national and EU levels.  I am, needless to say, open to any proposals that could benefit the Irish fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I have established a strategy review group to inform Ireland's negotiating strategy in the context of the 2002 review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The terms of reference of the review group involve the carrying out of a wide ranging examination of current fisheries policy and it will consult widely in the course of its deliberations. The group will be seeking views and inputs from the public.</P>
      <P>Should the Deputy wish to provide details of his proposals, I will arrange to have these considered by the group.</P>

      <P>The Government places the highest priority on the implementation in full of the British-Irish Agreement.  We are fully committed to meeting all legislative requirements flowing from the Agreement, on time.</P>
      <P>Legislation will be required in respect of the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council and of implementation bodies.  The Government will be in a position to start drafting legislation immediately once political agreement is reached on the bodies.  The enactment of this legislation in the Oireachtas will, however, be linked to the evolution of the situation as regards the entry into force of all of the institutions provided for in the Agreement.  Naturally, we hope that it will be possible to move ahead at an early date in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation under the Agreement on the release of prisoners, the establishment of a Human Rights Commission, changes to the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, employment equality and equal status are dealt with by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I would refer the Deputy to that Minister's reply to Question No. 321 of 20 October 1998 when he told the House of progress being made on these and other matters, and to <Col N="515" /> his reply to Questions Nos. 21, 22, 46 and 61of 26 November when he outlined further developments in relation to the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Agreement.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, the Garda informed APSO that they wished to interview the person concerned regarding a serious criminal offence.  At that time and since, the individual was in Nicaragua. The Garda asked APSO to provide information on his whereabouts and work.  This was provided to them.  On a number of occasions since then, APSO has voluntarily informed the Garda of any change in the person's situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="516" /> ASPO has at all times co-operated with the Garda in this matter.  It is understood, however, that no contact has been made by the authorities with the individual concerned.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> Ireland has participated extensively in peace-keeping for the last 40 years.  Since the start of Ireland's UN involvement in 1958 more than 45,000 individual missions have been recorded. There is currently a total of 751 Irish military personnel serving abroad, comprising 132 officers and 619 enlisted personnel.</P>
    <P>Ireland continues to build on a long tradition of service to the founding principles of the UN by making practical commitments of personnel on a continuing basis &mdash; proportionately, far beyond its size.  As well as the extensive involvement of Irish military personnel in UN peacekeeping operations, a number of senior military officers have, down the years, served with distinction in senior appointments in UN missions.  Most recently Lieutenant General David Stapleton served as force commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force in Syria &mdash; UNDOF.  These appointments bring prestige and honour not only to the Defence Forces but to the country as a whole.  Ireland has recently been requested by the UN to provide an officer in the rank of Brigadier General for the appointment of deputy force commander, UNIFIL.</P>
    <P>The concept of standby forces for UN peace-keeping missions has been in the course of development since 1990.  This system is intended to enhance the United Nations' capacity for rapid response to emergency situations.  I am happy to say that it has been decided that the Defence Forces will participate in this system, known as the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System &mdash; UNSAS.  I recently signed, on behalf of Ireland, an MOU with the UN in relation to our participation in UNSAS.</P>
    <P>Participation in UNSAS will not entail the commitment of additional personnel for UN service over and above the numbers which obtained during Ireland's participation in UN service in Somalia.  That is 850 military personnel.  There would be no obligation to participate in any particular mission and, as at present, Dáil approval would be required for the dispatch of a contingent to a specific operation.  Our decision to participate in UNSAS is a tangible expression of Ireland's continuing commitment to involvement in peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>Ireland is currently contributing to SFOR, the NATO-led stabilisation force in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This mission operates under a United Nations Security Council mandate.  Defence Forces participation in peacekeeping missions involves major operational taskings and a heavy financial commitment.  It is my policy to ensure that the Defence Forces are adequately trained, equipped and resourced to continue in this very important role of peacekeeping under the auspices of the UN.</P>
    <P>Overall, international participation by the Defence Forces in peacekeeping missions has had considerable benefits and has been a positive element in our relations with other countries.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the bottom up philosophy of the programme, the approved groups under Leader have the decision making authority in relation to the funding of individual projects including the provision of assistance towards the establishment of sectoral bodies in their areas. The groups take their decisions in accordance with the priorities of the business plans which they themselves have drawn up for the development of their areas.  In view of this I cannot request them to assist any particular type of project.</P>
      <P>The EU requirements governing the programme place considerable constraints on the type of project which may be aided in the agriculture sector.  As a result, producer or discussion groups may be aided only in very limited circumstances.</P>

      <P>The person concerned lodged a second year REPS application accompanied by a revised agri-environmental plan on 12 January 1998.  The revised plan included additional land for which the applicant sought payment.  A preliminary examination indicates that this land, while in the applicants possession at the time of joining REPS, was not included in his original plan.  It is a requirement of the scheme that all lands farmed must be included in the agri-environmental plan. As a consequence, this matter will have to be resolved before any further payment can issue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government's £31.5 million debt package announced on 16 September last.  In the context of this major debt relief package and in view of the progress made under the HIPC initiative and the lessons learnt from the external evaluation of ESAF I consider that it is now appropriate for Ireland to honour its proposed contribution to ESAF.  Subscription to ESAF is consistent with, and should enhance the attainment of, Ireland's wider overseas development co-operation objectives.</P>
      <P>Ireland accepts that structural adjustment is a fundamental and unavoidable part of the development process, not only for the developing world but even for the most advanced economies. Our own experience in Ireland during the mid-1980s serves to remind us that the structural adjustment process is difficult and painful.  It was this process, however, which laid the foundations for the economic success which we now enjoy.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding our fundamental concerns for good government, sound macroeconomic management and the right balance of sectoral and structural adjustment, Ireland has campaigned for some years to have certain aspects of the IMF's ESAF programme modified.  The external evaluation of ESAF published earlier this year proposed that the facility should promote deeper ownership of ESAF programmes on the part of the countries affected, incorporate social impact assessments of adjustment programmes, improve participative processes, particularly with the NGO sector, and deepen collaboration with the World Bank.</P>
      <P>The IMF has already taken steps to accommodate these measures in the planning, design and implementation of ESAF programmes.  This is a welcome development.  It is now up to Ireland and other like-minded countries to ensure these policies are incorporated and deepened in the ESAF process.  The Deputy can be assured that I will continue to do so.</P>

However, an official of my department met a delegation from the Irish Petroleum Industry Association Limited to discuss issues, including a request for an exemption from excise duty on kerosene, raised in their pre-budget submission. The Deputy is, no doubt, aware of my Budget Statement which left heating fuel excises unchanged.</P>
      <P>Among other items raised at the official meeting was that of alleged smuggling of kerosene from Northern Ireland.  That particular issue has been referred to the Revenue Commissioners for examination.</P>

      <P>The Government, in deciding on the application to EUROSTAT for a NUTS II reclassification, had to take account of factors such as the opposition expressed by the Commission to any regionalisation based on subsidy shopping and creative geography &mdash; this required a relatively modest approach in terms of reclassification; the precedent effect of recent changes in western peripheral regions of the UK; the need to meet general EUROSTAT criteria in regard to size, population and geographical contiguity.</P>
      <P>Against this background, the Government decided on an application for the reclassification of Ireland's single NUTS II region status into two NUTS II regions &mdash; one comprising the Border, midlands and the west, including Counties Kerry and Clare; the other comprising the rest of the country.  This application has now been lodged with EUROSTAT.  The proposed inclusion of Clare and Kerry in one region means that the total west coast from Donegal to Kerry is now encompassed.  This provides a plausible and realistic view of a peripheral area of the Community, in good balance with the overall Community picture.</P>
      <P>In regard to poor areas outside of the proposed Objective One region, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Government's commitment in its press release on the regionalisation proposal that the proposal will not in any sense deflect the Government from its commitment to tackle social exclusion, urban or rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced in my budget speech that I would look at the possibility of extending the pilot rural <Col N="530" /> renewal scheme to other rural areas on a targeted basis when EU clearance is given for the business tax incentives proposed under the scheme.  No such consideration about possible extensions will arise until after the EU clearance is obtained.</P>

      <P>The provision of dental treatment under the dental treatment services scheme to adults with medical card entitlements in the North Eastern Health Board area is the responsibility of the health board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the North Eastern Health Board.  The board has advised me that there has been an increase in demand for treatment under the scheme in 1998.  So far this year there has been an increase of almost 1,300 in the number of patients who received routine treatment as compared with the previous 12 months. Despite the additional demand the board was able to operate routine treatment services without waiting lists up to 30 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> However, to remain within its budget the board has found it necessary to temporarily suspend routine treatment services under the scheme. These services will be restored as soon as possible. I am making additional fielding available to health boards in 1999 for the dental treatment services scheme.  Additional funding totalling £0.410 million is available to the North Eastern Health Board.  These additional funds will be committed to the scheme when I have a firm undertaking from the Irish Dental Association to implement revised procedures designed to ensure greater accountability under the scheme.  These procedures were designed in full consultation with the association over the past two years.</P>
    <P>The revised procedures will also make the scheme more user friendly for the patient and the dental practitioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs would justify this.</P>
      <P>Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision previous Governments did not feel it was justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule.  It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Non-medical card holders are entitled to a broad range of health services including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory <Col N="532" /> charges and out-patient services free of charges. There are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication.  Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for those who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 March 1999, the drug cost subsidisation scheme and the drugs refund scheme will be merged into one new drugs payment scheme, whereby no individual or family will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines.</P>

Assessments of homelessness carried out in March 1991, March 1993 and March 1996 indicated that the numbers of homeless persons at those dates were 2,751, 2,667 and 2,501 respectively.

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, commits the Government to the restoration of real decision making and power to local authorities and local people.  In this context a significant range of initiatives which facilitate greater participation in local government, both directly and indirectly, have been progressed.</P>
      <P>Strategic policy committees, including representatives of local sectoral interests, have been established in city and county councils to enhance the policy making role of elected councillors and to involve the local community more closely in the work of the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> Implementation of the recommendations of the recently published report of the task force on integration of local government and local development systems will see local government and the wider community at the local level, including local development agencies and the social partners, working together on the proposed county-city development boards on the basis of real partnership.  The task force is overseeing implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <P>The boundaries of electoral areas for local elections were reviewed by independent boundary committees, with terms of reference requiring a new focus on service delivery areas, and orders implementing the committees' reports have been made; the Freedom of Information Act was extended to local authorities with effect from 21 October 1998, allowing citizens to examine and query the decision making process in local government.  To facilitate voter turnout, local elections will be held in conjunction with the European Parliament elections on Friday, 11 June 1999.</P>
    <P>A publicity campaign in November 1998 advised persons to check the draft register of electors which will be used for the forthcoming European and local elections.  There will be a gratuity for eligible councillors retiring before the next local elections which will encourage participation by younger candidates and women candidates as well as giving recognition for service to the community.</P>
    <P>A modern legislative framework for local government is being drafted, which will include provision for attendance by the public at local authority meetings.  Comhar &mdash; the national sustainable development partnership, to which I referred in my reply to Question No. 243 of 1 December 1998, will be established shortly and will deliver on the Government's commitment to increasing partnership and consultation on environmental policy.  It will also facilitate broad public participation in issues of sustainable development.</P>

      <P>The development of effective measures for the management of their housing estates, including arrangements to facilitate tenant participation, is the responsibility of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance attached to tenant participation in estate management, a number of initiatives have been taken by my Department. Each housing authority is required to have a statement of policy that sets out, <i>inter alia,</i> its policy on involving tenants in the management of their estates.  Authorities have been requested to <Col N="539" /> implement a programme of tenant development and information courses in order to secure better cooperation with residents and to promote a good community spirit in housing estates.  Best practice guidelines in key areas of housing management, including tenant participation, were prepared by the housing management group.  Regional workshops were organised to promote the implementation of the guidelines throughout the country together with a workshop for city and county managers to secure their commitment for early implementation.</P>
    <P>The housing management initiatives grants scheme was introduced in 1995 to provide assistance to local authorities and other bodies for practical pilot projects in housing management. To date, many of the projects have focused on tenant or staff training for participation in estate management.  The allocation for the scheme this year is £200,000 and a further £200,000 is being provided in 1999.</P>
    <P>My Department participates in a number of cross departmental initiatives which impact on the area of estate management and has also co-operated with Area Development Management Ltd., in the development and implementation of a &ldquo;training for trainers&rdquo; course in estate management. Financial support has been provided to the voluntary housing body Respond!  towards the development of the certificate course in housing and community studies, the major element of which relates to tenant participation in estate management.</P>
    <P>The housing unit, funded by my Department and local authorities for a three year period, has been established in the Institute of Public Administration. The purpose of the new unit is to assist local authorities to deliver a more responsive housing service and to develop a more effective approach to housing management with an emphasis on tenant involvement.  A broadly based consultative committee is in place to provide advice and guidance and to oversee the implementation of the work programme.  Membership of the committee comprises representatives of local authorities, the voluntary sector, tenants and a local authority elected member.</P>
    <P>I also refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 219 on today's Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of a £10 per week increase in the maximum personal weekly rate of old age pensions, other payments to people over 66 and widow's-widower's pensions is shown in the attached table.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that contributory based payments are financed through the social insurance fund, while social assistance payments are financed directly by the Exchequer.  The social insurance fund is made up of PRSI contributions made by employers, employees and the self-employed; in years in which these contributions are insufficient to pay for benefit entitlements the shortfall is made up by the Exchequer.  The cost to the Exchequer of increases in contributory payments in any year therefore depends on whether the fund is in surplus or deficit.  The fund is currently in surplus.</P>
      <P>The recent budget made provision for increases in weekly rates of social welfare payments costing £201.67 million in a full year.  These increases include a weekly increase of at least £3 per week in the rate of payments made to persons aged under 66 years of age and an increase of £6 to people over 66.</P>
      <P>In so far as pensioners are concerned, the effect of these increases is that the old age contributory pension will now stand at £89 per week, a 14 per cent increase on the rate which applied in 1997 when this Government came into office.  A couple in receipt of the maximum rate of old age contributory pension will be £9 per week better off as a result of the increases provided for in the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 225, 226 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>Christmas bonus payments are provided by my Department to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, such as old age pension, widow's pension, long-term unemployment assistance, one-parent family payment, invalidity pension and certain other long-term payments.</P>
      <P>The amount paid is 70 per cent of their basic weekly payment, subject to a minimum payment of £20.  Some 715,000 people will automatically receive these Christmas bonus payments this year, at a cost of about £40 million.</P>
      <P>Health boards have responded over the years to the extra demands placed on people at Christmas time by making exceptional needs payments, ENPs, under the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme.  However, practice has evolved differently in the eight health boards. One feature adopted in seven of the eight health boards is the payment of a standard amount to certain categories of SWA recipients.  The standard amount which was paid differed from health board to health board, as did the criteria applied to who would get a payment and would not.</P>
      <P>The circular issued by my Department on 27 November related solely to the treatment of these standardised payments within the ENP system. The objective of the circular was to ensure that those who receive a standardised payment are treated in a fair, equal and consistent manner regardless of the health board area in which they reside.</P>
      <P>Health boards are not limited to making standardised payments in respect of the additional needs people have at Christmas time. They are obliged to make additional payments, not limited to any fixed percentage of the basic rate, to any individual where the board is satisfied that their means are insufficient to meet their needs, including the additional needs that arise at this time of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no question of any removal of entitlements and consequently, no savings were involved.  In fact, one consequence of the circular is that hundreds of people who are in receipt of SWA on an interim basis while awaiting a long-term payment such as one-parent family payment <Col N="543" /> or old age pension will now get an additional payment of SWA on time for Christmas which they would not have received under the arrangements that were previously in place.  No group which usually receives Christmas bonus on a supplementary welfare payment will be excluded in 1998.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the proposed Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NIAH, currently being carried out by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, on a statutory basis.  The inventory will act as a crucial database in identifying buildings throughout the State which are worthy of protection.  This proposed legislation is part of a package of measures for <Col N="544" /> the protection of the architectural heritage approved by Government and announced by myself and my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in May 1998.  The NIAH legislation is currently being finalised and I expect to be able to publish it shortly.</P>
    <P>The new protection measures include the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to buildings listed for protection.  This scheme, which will commence in 1999, will be administered by the local authorities, will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum, and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards currently being drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my Department, the Department of Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council.  This scheme should be of assistance to owners of stately homes of historic significance listed for protection in local authority development plans.</P>

    <P>There is no set hourly rate for overtime.  Overtime is linked to the pay of the officer involved so the higher an officer is on his scale or in grade, the higher the hourly amount payable.  The rate <Col N="545" /> payable also varies in respect of the accumulated hours per week, that is, the first three hours overtime per week are paid at the rate of time and a quarter, the next five hours at a time and a half and the remainder at double time.  There are also special rates payable in respect of Sunday and public holiday overtime.  Overall, the average amount paid per hour, in the first half of 1998, was approximately £19.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, without expending a disproportionate amount of staff time, to ascertain exactly the extra hours worked by the officers above.  However, the level of overtime earned by the top officer above equates to approximately 36 basic hours extra per week. That level of extra attendance is, however, not sustainable and is a matter of concern which governors have been asked to seek ways to avoid in the future.  Prison officers are conditioned to work a basic 39-hour week.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>One of the stated strategic goals for my Department is to formulate and oversee the implementation of policies for the promotion and development of sport, and to encourage increased participation in sport and recreation, particularly by disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a statutory sports council, dedicated exclusively to the advancement of sport at all levels, together with a more strategic approach to the use of resources available for sport, will further enhance the role of recreational sport.  The Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, provides that a specific function of the council will be to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport and to co-ordinate their implementation by all bodies involved in promoting recreational sport and providing recreational facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently, in association with the Irish Sports Council, reviewing existing programmes <Col N="549" /> and funding schemes for recreational sport, in order to ensure that we have a funding system which facilitates a co-ordinated, better structured and more effective delivery of recreational sport opportunities.</P>
    <P>A new funding application format has already been introduced for national governing bodies of sport which incorporates planned provision for recreational sport, which is geared to encouraging and enabling these organisations to develop and promote initiatives and programmes in this crucial area of sport.</P>
    <P>Other initiatives in the area of recreational sport include a project aimed at involving young people in recreational sport &mdash; Youth Sport Foyle &mdash; being piloted in the north-west and the sport for all leaders award scheme, a joint initiative between the Irish Sports Council and the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, was launched in Omagh today.</P>

      <Quest>the criteria under which an application made by the Mountaineering Council of Ireland for the 1998 Irish K2 expedition was rejected; and if he has satisfied himself that, in the making of decisions, the Irish Sports Council is not laying too much emphasis on competitive sport with the consequent neglect of participation in sport.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>Following a sustained process of detailed, close consultation with the national governing bodies of sport &mdash; NGBs &mdash; a new simplified and streamlined application format, together with new criteria, were introduced in respect of funding for 1998.  This new procedure is soundly based on the development of a better planned, more strategic approach to the development of the organisations themselves and to the development of their sports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, the Mountaineering Council of Ireland submitted their 1998 application for funding in the new format, incorporating a request for funding for the K2 expedition under the heading of international competition and training.  The purpose for which the Irish Sports Council recommended allocations under the international competition and training heading i.e. to enable NGBs to participate in such training and competition which contributes to a clearly defined progressive pathway towards improved <Col N="550" /> international rankings and world class performances by participating members, is clearly set out in my Department's FOI Act 1997, section 15 and 16 reference book.</P>
    <P>In the view of the council, mountaineering expeditions do not qualify for funding under this heading, as the participants are not competing against other international competitors, there is no ranking system, national or international, for the sport nor can performances by the mountaineers be critically judged or classed.</P>
    <P>I can, however, assure the Deputy that noncompetitive, recreational sport is a key priority of my Department and of the Irish Sports Council. In fact, the new application format for NGBs includes a section on recreational sport, which will help encourage and enable these organisations to develop and promote initiatives and programmes in this crucial area of sport.  In addition the Irish Sports Council Bill, 1998, proposes that the council will have a specific function to develop strategies for increasing participation in recreational sport.</P>

      <P>Details of schools in the Dublin area which are involved in the breaking the cycle pilot project are set out below.  The operation of the breaking the cycle pilot project is being closely monitored over the five year pilot phase, both internally by the schools staff involved, in conjunction with the Department's inspectorate and also externally by the Education Research Centre. A key element of the review process will be the appropriateness of the support package now in place as a means of combating educational disadvantage. The outcome of the review will contribute to the future development of support services for children from disadvantaged backgrounds in both urban and rural areas.</P>

      <P>I understand that an educational placement has been offered to the child in question at St. Paul's special school in Beaumont or in special class provision in Donnycarney or Finglas.  I recently announced a series of important new developments in the special education area. These included my Department's formal recognition of the distinct educational needs of certain children with autism and the introduction of a special pupil teacher ratio of 6:1 and child care support for such children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current school year, a number of special classes catering specifically for children with autism have been established in both primary schools and special schools.  To date, a total of 14 such special classes have been established in mainstream primary schools and a further nine classes in special schools.  This includes a total of four special classes in the Donnycarney and Finglas areas in which the pupil referred to has been offered placement.  Each class, which caters for a maximum of six children, receives the support of a class teacher, a child care assistant and enhanced capitation funding.  In addition, an outreach support service is provided by the relevant health authority.  These services continue to be <Col N="556" /> available for the child in question.  It is my intention to continue to make such provision available to children with autism who require such a response.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.  I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of full or part-time teacher support or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, as part of this major development in special needs provision, arrangements are being made to ensure that the child in question will continue to have the support of a child care assistant after Christmas.  My Department will be in contact with the child's school very shortly in relation to this matter.</P>
