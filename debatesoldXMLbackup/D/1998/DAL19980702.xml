      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with the Second Stage of No. 5 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is disgraceful that we are not having a proper Committee Stage debate on legislation concerning the release of some prisoners, but not others, on a discriminatory basis. The criteria for prisoner release should be settled by Statute and as that is not being done in the legislation there should be an opportunity to amend it.  It displays very bad ordering of Government business that this legislation was not produced in sufficient time to allow time for a Second Stage debate and a separate Committee Stage debate with a reasonable interval in which to consider amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My party colleagues and I have raised this matter on a number of occasions and we offered assistance to the Government in drafting the legislation.  The Government stated that legislation was not necessary.  We provided a minimalist Bill that, on the one hand, gave effect to that legal observation and, yet, met the political imperative of introducing legislation on the other.  Without any prior consultation, the Government then introduced fairly comprehensive legislation, including provision for a commission. As Deputy Bruton said, the Government is attempting to put all this through in an unacceptably <Col N="1143" /> short period.  I am not happy with the time provisions that have now been made available, having regard to the nature of this legislation which was not signalled by the Government, either formally or informally, at any stage prior to the circulation of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the concerns expressed about this Bill by the two previous speakers.  It is a more detailed Bill than the Taoiseach indicated would be necessary.  Despite that, the functions being provided to the commission are virtually non existent.  It is very much a cover for inaction.  We should be given adequate time to debate it on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill was signalled a number of weeks ago.  Legally and technically, we did not require legislation on this matter.  We were advised by both the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General on the matter but because of the wording in the British-Irish Agreement, I said we would bring it forward.  Second Stage will be taken this morning and Committee Stage will be taken this afternoon.  That is an adequate amount of time to address this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that lunchtime is sufficient to draft amendments on whether some people should stay in jail for up to 20 years and others should be released within a short time?  If we are a democracy ruled by law, surely this matter should be debated properly.  The Taoiseach's suggestion that lunchtime would be sufficient time to assess what has been said on Second Stage, draft amendments, consider those amendments and, if necessary, adopt them, is not reasonable in any concept of parliamentary business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose amending the Order of Business to extend the time this evening from 7 p.m. to 10.30 p.m. to tease out the amendments to which Deputy John Bruton and others referred.  I have raised this matter repeatedly in the past and the time allocation for this Bill is not sufficient. We are due to end our business this evening at 7 p.m. I propose to the Government that Standing Orders be amended to allocate three and a half hours extra time to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I received no such request.  The Whips originally agreed that the two Stages would be taken together.  Yesterday I received a request to separate Second Stage and Committee Stage and I agreed to that.  Second Stage will be taken today from 12 p.m. to 1.15 p.m. and Committee Stage will be taken from 3.50 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. This legislation is following on from the primary legislation.  I did not receive notice from Deputy Quinn or anyone else for additional time. Members have had two midnight sittings and I do not believe more time is needed for this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach on Tuesday to split the time so that Committee Stage could be taken separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips did not agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is entirely inadequate.  I do not know what the Government Whip was talking about when he said the Whips met yesterday. Nobody here was at such a meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it reasonable and proper parliamentary practice that sanctions are placed on tabling amendments to this legislation and that they must be tabled and circulated before the Minister introduces the legislation to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation will give effect to a commitment in the British-Irish Agreement which was negotiated with skill in the final stages by the Taoiseach but which was the product of the collective political efforts of the parties in this House.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this issue.  We know from the debate that characterised the first session of the Assembly in Northern Ireland yesterday that this is an issue of immense sensitivity.  We are only looking for three extra hours to tease out these matters, none of which were intimated when the matter was raised repeatedly by me prior to the publication of this legislation.  We have only glanced at this legislation. I remind the Taoiseach that the normal convention is that Opposition parties have two weeks to study legislation between its publication and debate in this House.  In the spirit of co-operation which should send a message North of the Border, I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this matter, allow the Whips to meet and provide for extra time.  We have to be here tomorrow anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to amend the Order of Business.  I propose an amendment to remove the words &ldquo;and Remaining Stages&rdquo; from the Order of Business so that Second Stage will be concluded at 1.15 p.m., thereby allowing arrangements to be made by agreement for the remaining Stages to be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have arrangements tonight because they are not going home. They will be here tomorrow.  In view of what Deputy Quinn has said, although I was not formally requested to do so, I will change the Order <Col N="1145" /> of Business so that we sit to 9 p.m. That will allow a further two hours to debate this Bill.</P>

      <P>I read out No. 5a which was the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1998 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages.  I then said the Dáil should sit later than 4.45 p.m. today and business should be <Col N="1146" /> interrupted not later than 7 p.m. I amend that so that the Dáil should sit later than 4.45 p.m. and the business should be interrupted not later than 9 p.m. The Whips can work out the time slots later today.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the proposal for dealing with Committee and Remaining Stages of item 5 agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On that matter, now that it is agreed by the House that both Bills will be taken today, albeit on a contested basis, I suggest that there be an allocation of time as between Committee and Report Stages so that there will be a Report Stage for each Bill.  I suggest that perhaps the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Bill, 1998, Committee Stage, might run from 3.50 p.m. to 5.30 p.m; followed by the Firearms (Amendment) Bill, Committee Stage, from 5.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m; the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Bill, 1998, Report Stage, from 7.30 p.m. to 8.15 p.m; and the Firearms (Amendment) Bill, Report Stage, from 8.15 p.m. to 9 p.m; and that notice requirements with regard to amendments would be such as to facilitate amendments to be submitted after the conclusion of each stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the concept of breaking up the time.  I understand that the Whips have already had some discussions on this.  Subject to them agreeing, I have no difficulty. I do not know whether the times outlined by the Deputy are the exact times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this is the Taoiseach's function, but the proposal which I read is the one which has been put to, and agreed by, the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that agreed?  Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with Committee and Remaining Stages of item 5a agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>Is the proposal for the sitting tomorrow agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in condemning the sectarian attacks on Catholic churches overnight which display the worst features of bigotry and hatred of a kind which we must banish from this land?  Will he agree it is <Col N="1149" /> inappropriate that this has occurred in particular on a day when such a hopeful sign has been shown in the appointment of a First Minister and Deputy First Minister for the two communities who are pledged to work together for the interests of all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of matters relate to Northern Ireland.  Certainly, I join Deputy Bruton, as no doubt other Leaders in this House will, in condemning the sectarian attacks in places of worship.  May I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the Deputy if he has a different question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, join the other Deputies in condemning last night's arson attacks on churches, regardless of their denomination.  It is an attempt to drag Northern Ireland back into the past when a major step forward was taken yesterday with the election of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of the Assembly.  I congratulate David Trimble and Séamus Mallon on their election yesterday; it is a major step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the two issues, first, I congratulate David Trimble and Séamus Mallon and all the other Members who took their places at the Assembly yesterday.  It was an historic day. Many of us in this House would have thought it was not possible to get all the representatives of Nationalists and republicans, and Unionists and loyalists working together.  I certainly wish the First Minister and Deputy First Minister well in their task.</P>
      <P>I join Deputy Bruton in utterly deploring the arson attacks on a number of Catholic churches during the night.  It is totally inconsistent with any notion of civil or religious liberty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask every responsible person in the Nationalist community to ensure there is no retaliation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be only going down the road of those who perpetrated the attacks last night.  We have seen all that before and we do not want to see it again.  We must continue to make every effort to seek an accommodation in these difficult parades issues on the basis of mutual respect and tolerance.  I just hope nobody gets drawn into tit for tat actions.  That would be entirely wrong.  Needless to say, a Cheann Comhairle, I would be saying this regardless of the denomination of the churches which were attacked during the night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks which I fully endorse and support.  In view of the impasse which clearly remains with regard to <Col N="1150" /> Drumcree and the flashpoint which it could become, will the Taoiseach take any action in consultation with the British Prime Minister, who, it is reported, may visit Northern Ireland today or tomorrow?  Will he indicate to the House if he has had any contact with either the British Prime Minister or the newly elected First Minister, David Trimble, and his deputy, Séamus Mallon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was ongoing contact throughout the night.  I would like to be able to say that it is leading somewhere but that would not be correct.  I am talking to many of the parties, including the British Prime Minister. Officials are in contact with people on the ground to find some basis on which to move forward. Everybody wants to do this.  We will continue our efforts throughout the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a different matter, will the Taoiseach ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement to the House clarifying the situation about the loss of jobs at the Apple Corporation plant in Cork?  There is confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was announced that only 150 jobs would be lost but we now know that at least 350 jobs will be lost.  A spin has been put on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has indicated on a number of occasions that there is a group working on the aspects of the British-Irish Agreement which are relevant to the Republic. Has a list of the legislation required been prepared; if so, when will it be published and will it include legislation providing for the establishment of the commission on human rights proposed in the Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the list and will pass it on to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to ask the Taoiseach to adjudicate on remarks made by two honourable lady members of his Government but will he clarify something?  In debating the Estimates recently the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands said the Broadcasting Bill would be published in July.  On Tuesday the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicated it would be published before the end of the year.  As the man in charge, <Col N="1151" /> will the Taoiseach make a ruling and indicate clearly when we can expect to see the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What is it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to learn that 75 members of the Defence Forces died while serving abroad.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has promised to introduce legislation to give effect to the convention on the protection of UN personnel serving abroad.  The convention cannot come into effect until 20 countries have signed up.  We cannot sign up until the legislation is passed.  The Taoiseach informed me recently that it was not far off.  Will he ensure it is brought forward in the new session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach informed me recently that he intends to make an order to amend other defective orders affecting non-salaried staff in what was CIE so that workers with 45 years' service will receive a pension greater than £45 per week.  When will the order be made and will it apply retrospectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not reached the stage of preparing the order.  The Attorney General is to present a report on what we can do and it will cover the question of retrospection.  I said I would like to make progress before the end of July.  I <Col N="1152" /> will inform the Deputy when the matter has been brought to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the findings of the Price Waterhouse review of the Naval Service and Air Corps will be published and available before the end of July so that legislation can be introduced providing for the reform of the Defence Forces?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>There has been an extraordinary delay in introducing the school attendance Bill which is of personal concern in the constituencies of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste.  Is the Taoiseach aware that no school has been informed of the promised extra teacher allocation?  These were announced three months before the end of the last school year.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 10, after &ldquo;AS&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;FIONTRAÍOCHT ÉIREANN OR IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The argument was made on Committee Stage that two famous names in the Irish language are being extinguished and replaced by the new title Enterprise Ireland.  During the course of the debate yesterday on the Copyright Bill a number of Deputies mentioned that the name Enterprise Ireland has been patented and that difficulties may be encountered about its use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should clarify the position about the use of the name Enterprise Ireland.  Is she aware that legal advice is being taken by the Small Firms' Association about its use?  I do not agree with Deputy Broughan on the use of the name Fiontraíocht Éireann.  An English language name would be more suitable. However, I am concerned that Enterprise Ireland will be obliged to go before the courts following its establishment and, as a result, it will not be able to work effectively.  Will the Minister explain the current position regarding the application by the Small Firms' Association to patent the name &ldquo;Enterprise Ireland&ldquo;?  Will that application prevent her using the name?</P>

      <P>I am not in a <Col N="1154" /> position to accept Deputy Broughan's amendment. As I stated on Committee Stage, it is important that the name of the organisation clearly explains the purpose of that organisation. Since Enterprise Ireland will have a major role in promoting Irish products overseas, it is important that those with whom we trade understand what the organisation is about.  The Irish Trade Board, which is also known as Córas Tráchtála&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct, Córas Tráchtála was abolished.  Last year Ireland's honorary consul in western Canada brought to my attention a company that wants to do business here.  I met him early in the morning and he showed me a long list of the organisations with which he intended to meet.  Included on that list were the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála and Córas Tráchtala.  I explained to him that Córas Tráchtála had been replaced by An Bord Tráchtála.  For obvious reasons An Bord Tráchtála operates overseas as the Irish Trade Board.</P>
      <P>I have taken legal advice in respect of the matter to which Deputy Owen referred.  It is not possible to patent commonly used words such as &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  I am surprised by the actions of the Small Firms' Association because in informal discussions I had with its representatives on the fringe of other meetings I gained the impression that they were delighted by our choice of title for the new organisation.  At its recent conference on enterprise in Ireland the association clearly explained what it is trying to promote. I am strongly advised that there is no legal problem because commonly used words such as &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; cannot be patented.</P>

      <P>When Enterprise Ireland is established, will the Minister ensure that it initiates a public awareness campaign to identify the areas for which it will have responsibility?  This will avoid confusion about the multiplicity of agencies involved in the area of industrial promotion.  It is important that the public be made aware of Enterprise Ireland's responsibilities.  This information should also be disseminated overseas to avoid confusion about which agencies have responsibility for industrial promotion in Ireland.</P>

      <P>I will withdraw the amendment. However, in the past decade Irish people have been obliged to come to terms with using words such as &ldquo;Isuzu&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hyundai&rdquo; , etc., which originated in other languages.  I believe the principle contained in the amendment remains worthy because, in the vernacular of international commerce, it is important to have a strong name.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 4, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, made following consultation with recognised trade unions or staff associations representing staff affected by the making of the order,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The staff of Forbairt believe they have not been adequately consulted in the run up to the commencement order being made.  Some of these people have been valuable servants of the State for the past 40 to 45 years and they are entitled to be consulted rather than being served with a diktat from officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They are entitled to real consultation and real involvement in their future.  Many of them are facing the prospect of having their functions extinguished and they are uncertain what lies ahead.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept the amendment and I explained the reason for this to the Deputy on Committee Stage.  To write into legislation that something must happen only after consultation confers on people certain legal entitlements.  I do not want to spend the coming months in the courts or elsewhere trying to establish whether the consultation envisaged took place.  As stated on Committee Stage, there has been widespread consultation.  My officials met the unions, the workers and their representatives once every three weeks since the implementation began six months ago.  Those arrangements will <Col N="1156" /> continue and I assure the Deputy that diktats will not be issued.</P>
      <P>I want the new organisation to have a highly motivated staff.  I have tabled a later amendment to deal with mobility between the different agencies, an issue of great concern to the staff.  I gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to include provisions in that regard in the legislation.  I want to reinforce the idea that mobility between agencies is good.  It is good for people to move from one organisation to another from time to time because this can enhance people's careers and benefit the organisations and their clients.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Daly's comments on amendment No. 1, we will ensure that a high profile is attached to the establishment of the agency so that everyone will be aware of Enterprise Ireland's purpose.  The Deputy is correct to state that we want to avoid confusion.  The purpose in establishing the new organisation is to streamline the manner in which the State engages with Irish firms.  As far as possible, I want to ensure that affected firms will be clear about the new organisation's purpose and that they will know how to contact it.  I am anxious that a good local network will be put in place throughout the country to ensure that the organisation will be accessible to companies at a regional level.  We will do everything in our power to see that this happens.  I take on board the points made by Deputy Daly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will proceed to amendment No. 5.  Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9 are related.  Therefore, we will discuss amendments Nos. 5, 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 22, after &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(which functions may be exercised in relation to the activities of Irish enterprises outside the State)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Following discussion on Committee Stage, we feel there should be a stronger commitment to the export side of the former functions of An Bord Tráchtála.  We accept the logic of the type of agency that will emerge, but we need to emphasise the key elements of the mission statement of the new agency and have a clear commitment to supporting our exporters, given the massive role of trade in the economy and our current prosperity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In refusing to accept any of these amendments to strengthen the functions under section 7 and be more up front in spelling out the role of exporters, the Minister explained that she had transposed the section from the Bord Tráchtála legislation into this legislation.  However, that legislation was written in the context of setting up a trade board.  Here we are talking about setting up Enterprise Ireland which has a number of wider functions.  So, sections in the trade board legislation to develop, promote, assist and develop the marketing of goods, are already predicated on the fact that there is a trade board and that it does not have to be spelt out.  The Minister's explanation that she has transposed existing legislation into new legislation is not quite valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again stress that the concept of trade pro <Col N="1159" /> motion services to exporters of goods and services includes and is normally interpreted as market research, market intelligence and introduction to buyers, importers, agents and distributers in the market.  If the Minister is not willing to accept these amendments, I hope the exact functions of Enterprise Ireland, which are not spelt out in this legislation, will be set down in the document she talks about writing after the legislation is in place.  I ask her seriously to put down in that document the words &ldquo;to provide trade promotion services to exporters of goods and services&rdquo;.  I do not want exporters coming to me and to other Deputies in six months' or one year's time complaining that they have been written out of the picture, that they cannot get their share of the knowledge and information Enterprise Ireland has, and that they are not getting the same or better services than they were getting under the trade board.  My aim here is to make sure the service currently being given by the trade board, and any augmentation of those services, is included in Enterprise Ireland's functions, role and mission statement.  The mission statement is very clear.  It talks about promoting exports because that is the only way we can make companies grow.  In the legislation the word &ldquo;export&rdquo; appears only once, at most twice, and not even under the functions of the board.  I am pressing the Minister to include the spirit of what we are saying in these amendments in her document setting out the functions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give Deputy Owen that assurance.  The whole purpose is to help Irish companies to achieve sustainable and competitive advantage.  To do that they must be involved in exports because we have a very small internal market of three and a half, growing to, perhaps, four million in a number of years and on the island as a whole we have a market of only five million.  For Irish companies to grow their sales, employment and opportunities, they have to do it internationally in the context of exports.  Unlike companies in many other jurisdictions, Irish companies have to internationalise much earlier because of the small size of the market.  It is not the intention, nor would it make any sense, to establish a State agency and to use taxpayers' money to simply help companies to displace other companies in the Irish market.  That happened in the past, and it was not a very sensible approach. It happened in relation to re-equipment grants where, when one company was assisted to upgrade its premises or equipment, a competitor was put out of business.  Nobody wants that to happen.  It would not make sense and would be of no advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give the assurance that this new agency will have a huge export focus.  Equally we have to be careful.  Because of State aid rules we are prohibited from subsidising exports, interfering with the internal market and creating rules that break competition policy.  We also have to ensure that <Col N="1160" /> we are not accused in any sense of not being good European players, although that does not concern me as much as breaking the rules themselves. Within the State aid rules, which specifically rule out subsidising exports, we have to draft the legislation in accordance with the rules by which we are obliged to play.  We took paragraphs (b) and (c) in section 7(1) directly from the An Bord Tráchtála Act to make it clear that we would promote, assist and develop the marketing of service industries and goods.  That can only be done in an export context because it is not just about displacement and serving the needs of a small market of 3.5 million people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen made a good suggestion in relation to the policy document which we will issue.  I give a commitment that we will place a heavy emphasis on the need to make our companies grow in an international and export context.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 23, after &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;at all levels&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the programme of legislation for the remaining years of this Administration I ask the Minister to bring forward legislation to cover micro-business, which is not included here.  We had an informal discussion on this matter earlier and the Bill does not give sufficient service to small business.  Perhaps the Minister might examine that at a later stage.</P>

      <P>On the policy document for small firms, would it be possible to examine the companies from one to ten?  The enterprise boards are doing excellent work but they may not have sufficient expertise and it is important that Enterprise Ireland works closely with the enterprise boards to help companies in the crucial early years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I give that assurance.  We want to ensure there is no duplication between the role of the enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland but we also want to ensure we do not miss opportunities. We cannot have hard and fast rules. Some technology companies started from a very small base with perhaps two or three people and now have great potential.  Because Forbairt, as it was, and Enterprise Ireland, when it is established, will be involved on the county enterprise boards and in the evaluation procedures they use in deciding to grant-aid companies, there will be a very close link.  I will ensure we make it clear to Enterprise Ireland that it is not a rigid rule, it will have to be practical and sensible. <Col N="1161" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>We had a lengthy discussion on the technological role of one of the agencies of Forbairt which is being subsumed into the new Enterprise Ireland. The Minister has made some concessions in other amendments in relation to that and, as a result, I withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 41, after &ldquo;members&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with each gender represented by at least five members.  There shall be four members elected by the staff of the agency.  Not less than four members shall have had scientific and technological training or work experience&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I said on Committee Stage that I believed Deputy Rabbitte's amendment was the most concise way of expressing what Deputies on our side of the House wanted to achieve, namely, clear representation for the staff of the new agency.  When Forbairt comes together with ABT and the services to business section of FÁS, it is essential that there is direct staff representation at the highest level of the agency.  Some Deputies were of the view that it was not a commercial State body but it is on the cutting edge of service to the commercial world, and the best way of achieving good <i>esprit de corps</i> from day one is to have the staff involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendments the Minister introduced arising from Committee Stage.  She has been willing to take on board the spirit of many of our amendments on Committee Stage.  I am disappointed she was unable to agree to Deputy Rabbitte's amendment which was more focused on the staff.  There is a facility under one of the sections to set up committees of the board.  If the board is unwilling to allow staff representatives on the board &mdash; I hope they come around to that idea &mdash; perhaps one of its subcommittee formats could be used to involve the staff in its work.  I am putting this forward merely as a <Col N="1162" /> suggestion.  I do not know if it is practical but we have to make suggestions that might work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Owen's suggestion that there should be a consultative process at sub-board level involving the staff and the management is a good one.  Sub-board groups of that kind should exist in all organisations.  An issue about which I have not thought too clearly is the term of office of the chief executive.  We have now made a change in that the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland can serve no more than two terms of five years, which is a maximum of ten years, and after five years the board must decide whether to reappoint the chief executive.  In effect, the chief executive will be appointed for five years but cannot be appointed for longer than ten years.</P>
      <P>We have also made some changes in relation to the length of time people can stay on the board.  Under the provisions in the Bill as originally drafted, somebody could be on the board for eight consecutive years.  I am not certain that is a good idea.  On the anniversary of the establishment day, two members will come off the board and in five years all members will have been removed.  The Minister of the day can decide to reappoint those people but nobody can be on the board for longer than ten years.  That is an improvement.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the staff's work and the fact that, as executives, they will be dealing with companies, making recommendations about the support those companies should receive, whether it is grant-aid, advice, marketing assistance or whatever, it is better that they do not participate when the board, which is a separate vehicle for assessing the recommendations of staff, is analysing those recommendations.</P>
      <P>As it is not a commercial organisation there will not be any change in the ownership of the board.  It will remain a State body.  I do not think there will be any question of it being privatised; I am sure nobody will want to take over an organisation that gives out about £50 million or £60 million a year.  We do not intend to change the work practices or contract out many of the activities. It is not in the same league as other boards like Bord na Móna, the ESB or other companies that have had to undergo enormous change both in the way they are financed and in terms of ownership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If somebody could make money out of this business I am sure we would consider privatisation.  I would not be establishing it if I thought a private organisation would be so generous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Ms Harney Ms Harney">
      <NameTxt>Ms Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are aspects that could be done by the private sector, they should be done. That will remain the position.  We have to have an open mind about some of the services.  From time to time, boards of this kind bring in private consultants when they do not have their own expertise.  We want them to do that only when they do not have their own expertise or where it is done in the context of getting value for money and not just as a routine matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the board and the manner in which it will be established, we want people who can make a contribution to developing enterprises in this State.  In particular, it is important that in its infancy we have people of experience.  I am not saying members of the staff are not of a high calibre and do not have experience but the focus must be on people with business experience who have come from the enterprise world.</P>
      <P>I was pleased when the outgoing chief executive of the Bank of Ireland, Pat Molloy, decided to accept our invitation to chair the new board.  He is a dynamic person with a great deal of experience dealing with small, medium and large companies both here and abroad.  For those reasons, he will make an outstanding chairman of the new organisation and hopefully will steer it in the right direction in its first five years.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputies for agreeing to take this measure today.  This is a practical indication of the willingness of every Member to play his or her part in supporting the British-Irish Agreement. As the House will be aware, there were briefings of party leaders about this matter.  As part of that process the leader of the Labour Party very helpfully let the Taoiseach have a copy of a draft Bill dealing with this matter.  I appreciate that and, while the Bill before the House goes <Col N="1165" /> beyond the approach in the Labour Party draft, the Bill which I have introduced reflects the central approach proposed in that draft.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Bill represents just one element of my Department's continuing involvement with the peace process and I will deal briefly with some of the other elements later.  There can be no doubt one of the most contentious aspects of the British-Irish Agreement has been the part of it which deals with the accelerated release of prisoners.  It is easy to understand why this should be so.  On one level many people find it difficult to reconcile the early release of prisoners with their basic concept of justice.  They remember truly terrible events which have taken place and instinctively react against the idea that some of the people involved in those events should be released from prison early.</P>
    <P>The issue of prisoners was one of the most difficult issues which all the participants to the negotiations had to address.  We were faced with a situation where the Agreement would not have provided the basis for a fresh settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict and a fresh start unless the issue of prisoners was addressed in the manner in which it is.</P>
    <P>I know from my contacts, particularly with the relatives of members of the Garda Síochána who were killed in the course of duty, the difficulties which many of them have with what is being proposed. Sadly, there is nothing any of us can say which could be expected to ameliorate the sense of hurt and loss of the families involved.  The reality, however, is that a very difficult judgment had to be made about what set of circumstances would bring about the best chance of ensuring peace would prevail on this island; that might prevent future needless death and destruction and that could mean those families grieving at present would not inevitably be replaced by generations of newly bereaved.  In short, we were trying to ensure that in future people of the island would not be imprisoned by history in a hopeless cycle of violence.</P>
    <P>For all the understandable concerns many people have about the prisoner issue, the position now is that the Agreement has been accepted by the vast majority of the people of the island and it falls on all of us to give full effect to all its terms.  The Bill before the House today is part of that process.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members will agree it is vital that we do not overlook the concerns of victims of such violence.  It was precisely in that context that the first initiative I was able to take on foot of the Agreement was directed to the concerns of victims of such violence.  That involved obtaining Government approval for the appointment of former Tánaiste, John Wilson, to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of those in this jurisdiction who had suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.  I am very grateful, as I am sure we all are, to the former <Col N="1166" /> Tánaiste for agreeing to undertake this task. Those of us who have the honour of knowing him on a personal level will be well aware of the special characteristics which he will bring to this difficult task.</P>
    <P>His terms of reference have been finalised and it is particularly appropriate in the context of the present debate to inform the House of them. First, to conduct a review of services and arrangements in place, in this jurisdiction, to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years and to identify what further measures need to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of those in question.  This includes, in particular, consideration of the following: the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement in regard to victims; the needs and concerns of persons who sustained serious injury and members of the immediate families of those who have died or sustained serious injuries in the service of the State as a consequence of violent acts ensuing from the conflict; the needs and concerns of victims and the families of victims of major outrages including those of the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings.  Second, to advise on how the support given to victims by their families in helping them to cope with the immediate aftermath and continuing consequences of violence can be acknowledged and sustained.  It is important that the message goes out from the House today that we are fully aware of the plight of victims and will continue to address their concerns as best we can.</P>
    <P>The central requirement of the part of the Agreement dealing with prisoner issues is for both Governments to put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of certain categories of prisoners.  The Governments also indicated, in paragraph 4 of the relevant part of the Agreement, that they would seek to enact the appropriate legislation to give effect to these arrangements by the end of June 1998.  At the time of the negotiations it was already clear that legislation would be required in Northern Ireland and it also appeared possible that legislation might be required in this jurisdiction to deal with certain categories of prisoners who might be affected by the proposed arrangements.</P>
    <P>This commitment has been addressed by the introduction in Westminster of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill.  In addition, as part of the normal legislative process, a detailed examination has been carried out by my Department in conjunction with the Attorney General's office with a view to analysing and, if necessary, preparing any further legislative measures which might be necessary in this jurisdiction to give effect to the commitments contained in the Agreement in relation to prisoners.</P>
    <P>That examination concluded that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already appropriate and sufficient legislative powers &mdash; in particular, the Offences against the State Act, <Col N="1167" /> 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 &mdash; available to him to allow full effect to be given to the commitments contained in the Agreement relating to the release of prisoners without the need for specific additional legislation to be introduced.</P>
    <P>It is also worth bearing in mind that the primary legislation necessary to give effect to the British-lrish Agreement was passed by the Oireachtas in the form of the Bill to make the necessary constitutional changes which was subsequently passed by the people in the referendum. That measure will allow the State to consent to be bound by that Agreement in which, in turn, the Government reaffirms its commitment, <i>inter alia</i>, to implement the provisions of the Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations. This will, therefore, give a particular legal status to the terms of that Agreement including, of course, those relating to prisoners, although there will be a lapse of time before the State will be in a position to indicate its consent to be bound by the Agreement.</P>
    <P>While specific legislation is not necessary to allow effect to be given to the releases envisaged in the Agreement a broader political issue is at stake.  There is agreement on all sides of the House that we should do nothing which might be open to the perception that we are not complying fully with all the terms of the Agreement and in those circumstances there will be general support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detail of the Bill it is worth reminding ourselves of the main features of the relevant part of the British-Irish Agreement. It provides that both Governments will put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoners, including transferred prisoners, convicted of scheduled offences in Northern Ireland or, in the case of those sentenced outside Northern Ireland, similar offences.  Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from the arrangements.  Both Governments will complete a review process within a fixed timeframe and set prospective release dates of qualifying prisoners while allowing account to be taken of the seriousness of the offences for which the person was convicted and the need to protect the community.  In addition, the intention is that should the circumstances allow it, any qualifying prisoners who remained in custody two years after the commencement of the scheme will be released at that point.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that the British Government has introduced legislation to give effect in its jurisdiction to this part of the Agreement. Any comparison between the approach in that Bill and the measure before the House should take into account the fact that we are operating in different legal environments which make it inevitable that different approaches have to be taken.  In particular, the Bill does not contain <Col N="1168" /> any new powers of release in regard to prisoners.</P>
    <P>The intention is that prisoners released under the Agreement in this jurisdiction will be released under existing legislative provisions.  These are the same provisions that successive Governments have used in releasing prisoners in the context of trying to bring about a settlement.  We do not in our law have a system of &ldquo;on licence&rdquo; release but we have an equivalent power to impose conditions on releases.  That has been done in terms of the release of the relevant category of prisoner in recent years and that is what will be done when releases fall to be authorised under the Agreement. The central condition of such releases is that the person concerned will keep the peace; the person will not become involved in any criminal activity while on release.</P>
    <P>There has been public comment to the effect that the criteria in the Bill relating to the releases are not specific enough; I reject that.  There is no more straightforward and appropriate approach that could be taken to this matter than to provide, as the Bill does, that such releases will be considered by reference to the relevant part of the Agreement.  That in turn sets out the criteria to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I will now deal briefly with the detail of the Bill.  In essence the Bill will establish a commission to advise the Minister, by reference to that part of the Agreement, in regard to the exercise of those powers in the cases of prisoners whom he deems to be &ldquo;qualifying prisoners&rdquo; for the purpose of the Agreement.  Section 1 is a standard provision providing for certain necessary definitions.  Section 2 provides that on a day to be appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a body will be established to be known as An Coimisiún um Scaoileadh Saor Príosúnach, Release of Prisoners Commission. The commission will be independent in the performance of its function.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the function of the commission. Under subsection (1) its function will be to advise the Minister, when so requested by him or her, regarding the exercise of any power of release, as defined in section (1), in regard to those whom the Minister specifies as qualifying prisoners for the purposes of the terms of that part of the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks which relates to prisoners.  Subsection (2) provides that the Minister will request the commission to give advice on the exercise, by reference to the relevant provisions of the Agreement, of any power of release in relation to such prisoners. The subsection further provides that the commission will comply with such a request.  Subsection (3) states that the reference to &ldquo;relevant provisions&rdquo; is a reference to the provisions of the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks under the heading &ldquo;Prisoners&rdquo;.  These are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Minister or the Government in considering whether to exercise, by reference to the relevant provisions of the <Col N="1169" /> Agreement, any power of release in regard to a qualifying prisoner will have regard to the relevant provisions of the Agreement and the commission's advice.  This section particularly reflects the approach taken in the draft Labour Party Bill to which I referred earlier.  The membership and procedure of the commission are set out in section 5.  Subsection (1) provides that the commission will consist of a chairman and two ordinary members appointed by the Minister.  The person appointed to be chairman will be a solicitor or barrister who has practised for at least seven years prior to appointment.  The other members of the commission will be a member of the probation and welfare service and an officer of the Minister other than a member of the probation and welfare service.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in subsection (4) for the appointment by the Minister of a person to act as chairperson of the commission in certain circumstances. Such circumstances could arise where a case falling to be considered by the commission is one in which the original chairperson considers that he or she should not be involved because of any professional advice which he or she had given previously in his or her professional capacity.  A person appointed in such cases must also fulfil the criteria for eligibility as chairperson.  The section also provides that members will hold and vacate office on terms and conditions determined by the Minister, provides for the filling of casual vacancies, removal or resignation of members and payments to members.  Subsection (11) states that the commission will regulate its own procedure and business.</P>
    <P>Section 6(1) requires the commission to make a report in writing to the Minister of its activities since its establishment.  The report is to be made not later than two years after its establishment.  A copy of the report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister.  Under subsection (3) there is provision for the Minister to make an order at any time after the expiry of two years from its establishment for the dissolution of the commission where he or she is of the opinion that it is no longer necessary that it should remain in existence.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 are standard provisions providing for the payment of expenses arising under the Act and the Short Title.  The Schedule reproduces that part of the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks which deals with the issue of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable more time was not made available to allow Deputies participate in the debate and examine the legislation in the manner required.  Nevertheless, I am grateful to the Government and the Minister for agreeing to amend the Order of Business to allow for a greater level of discussion.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party supports the Bill which is in accordance with the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> It has been expressly provided for in the Agreement. It is extraordinary the Government felt there was no need to enact any legislation, having committed itself to such a course of action at an earlier date.  The Bill is in accordance with the Agreement.  Fine Gael will table a number of amendments dealing with matters of some importance &mdash; the manner in which the programme of release will be accelerated.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of prisoners to the ceasefire and to the advances made towards the peace process in recent years, particularly in the build up to August l994.  The contribution of prisoners was of great significance and should be acknowledged.  Similarly, in mid l997 their role was important in the context of a renewed ceasefire. I express satisfaction at the repatriation of prisoners and appreciate the efforts of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government in processing the transfer arrangements which have allowed for some 22 republican prisoners to be repatriated to date. The release of paramilitary prisoners is a confidence building measure, integral and fundamental to any peace process and fundamental to the building of a lasting settlement.  Obviously the greater concern on the prisoner issue is centred in Northern Ireland where there are more than 700 paramilitary prisoners: there are 47 here and 13 or 14 in Britain.  The peace process must be all inclusive and failure to include prisoners as part of the resolution of the conflict would lead to further violence.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of what the Minister said in his Second Stage speech.  It is important the prisoner issue is not looked at in isolation but as a fundamental component of what is an interesting, exciting and historic Agreement.  It should be noted that hundreds of ex-prisoners have already been released, having served time and in the main their contribution has been positive.  They have been accepted in their respective communities as ex-prisoners.  I acknowledge they have a significant role to play in rebuilding what is a torn society.</P>
    <P>The release of prisoners will undoubtedly upset many people, none more so than the victims of violent acts perpetrated against them and their relatives by those about to be released under the accelerated process.  It is a high price but if construed as an integral part of the peace process it is a price worth paying.  The acts of terrorism committed by some of these prisoners are shocking, striking as they did at the heart of the democratic process and undertaken by those who had absolutely no regard for the rule of law or order. However, the Agreement on 10 April presents a real opportunity for peace.  Therefore the price of prisoner release is one worth paying, albeit high and fraught with difficulties.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution of prison welfare groups, particularly NIACRO &mdash; Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders.  They have performed an important role in the reintegration and resettlement <Col N="1171" /> of ex-prisoners.  I acknowledge the contribution on this side of the Border of the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation and its seeds of hope programme and the feasibility study which facilitates the establishment of self help, social inclusion and possibilities by and for pre and post release prisoners, who have been involved in terrorist activities.  Each of these projects to date, be it in areas of creative writing, drama and music or craftwork and arts, is designed to become self sustaining and will be financed separately.  They have been enthusiastically received not only by the prisoners and their families but also by the communities.</P>
    <P>Many prisoners, particularly those who have served long periods realise their only future path is to reconstruct their lives and those of their families and work towards an effective re-entry into society.  While there is little data on reoffending among paramilitary or politically motivated prisoners, the indications are that there is a reoffending rate of about 2 per cent.  The seeds of hope project and similar endeavours are essential if this reintegration process is to be complete and worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Prison can have varying effects on people, some positive and some negative.  On the positive side there is the opportunity for second and third level educational attainment, an opportunity to renounce violent activities and a strong sense of personal and corporate discipline.  On the negative side there will be the fear of re-entry to the family and society structures, low job satisfaction, peer group association having been severed and rejected, low self esteem and low career expectation. It is important, therefore, that appropriate rehabilitation projects would address these problems and they are, therefore, essential.</P>
    <P>The Bill is weak and clarification is required on a number of issues.  Victims and relatives should be informed if and when offenders are about to be released with full particulars regarding their release and the reasons.  This is a matter we will consider in greater detail on Committee Stage. How transparent will the release programme be? What factors will be considered by the Minister in determining a release?  What factors will be employed by the commission in advising the Minister?</P>
    <P>The Bill is strangely silent on the role and function of the commission, other than to advise, without any real or adequate power.  If a release constitutes a threat to the community, will that be taken into consideration?  Is it reasonable to grant some form of release in view of the nature or seriousness of the offence?  Will the behaviour of the offender while in prison be taken into consideration? Are there any grounds to merit special consideration in the absence of such criteria or is the Government merely unlocking doors and opening the gates in an unconditional manner?  Will a calendar of release dates be set in advance in respect of qualifying prisoners, taking into account the seriousness of the offence <Col N="1172" /> and the need to protect the community?  Will there be a fixed timeframe within the two year period?  To whom shall the legislation apply? There is no adequate definition of a &ldquo;qualifying prisoner&rdquo;.  What is it or who might it be?  Our legislation does not contain a categorisation of political or paramilitary prisoner, although these terms have been and are widely used.  The Minister should have been more specific in defining who may and may not qualify.  He said that prisoners affiliated to groups which continue to engage in or return to violence will not be given early release, and this has been included in the Schedule to the Bill, which quotes from the section of the Agreement dealing with prisoners.</P>
    <P>I thought prisoners would be released on licence but the Minister has a difficulty with that. Perhaps he will explain to the House in some detail the conditions he proposes to attach to any release.  A recall procedure will be put in place in the event of a released prisoner engaging in terrorist activity.  Will that procedure be without warrant or court hearing, or will there be an avenue of appeal?  What is the precise nature of the due process in the event of a difficulty?  Perhaps we will have more time to explore these matters on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the lack of safeguards in the legislation.  Will the Minister have the power to suspend the operation of the scheme in its entirety, should circumstances so require?  In such a case, can the arrangement be called off and no new cases considered?  Does the Minister consider the scheme to be an amnesty for those convicted of terrorist offences?  I would like clarification of the operation of the release &mdash; whether it is a release, a licence or an amnesty &mdash; and the safeguards he envisages introducing, as these have not been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another matter the Minister must clarify before concluding the debate is the difficulty regarding the affiliation of persons to certain organisations.  A number of prisoners are affiliated to organisations which have not clearly called a ceasefire, but there may be former members of such an organisation who wish to break away from it.  Are they to remain prisoners of their organisation?  How does one cope with people who wish to break with the group to which they were attached at their conviction &mdash; can the Minister clarify their position?  Status has been accorded and recognition given to prisoners who describe themselves as non-aligned, and this description has been accepted by the Department. However, a person may wish to leave an organisation and renounce violence but not wish to join the non-aligned group because it has its own accepted regime and structures.  A person who wishes to renounce violent activity should not be a prisoner both of the State and of the organisation of which he was once a member.  I assume most eligible prisoners will be released within a two year period, at which point any prisoners still in custody will receive automatic release.  Should the date not be put in legislation <Col N="1173" /> while giving the Minister power to bring it forward or put it back, depending on the degree of progress towards a peaceful society?</P>
    <P>The Bill is weak on the role and function of the commission and the Minister said nothing to convince us it was other than window dressing.  I look forward to Committee and Report Stages and I support the Bill, weak as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome the publication and enactment of this Bill.  Its importance arises from its context.  The Government was party to the British-Irish Agreement, which was arrived at on 10 April.  All the constituent elements of that agreement must, in present circumstances, be regarded by all parties as of equal and binding significance.  There can be no room for any of us to cherry-pick.</P>
      <P>The point my party leader, Deputy Quinn, raised with the Taoiseach over the last few weeks may be dismissed by some as a technicality.  There is legislation available to this Government, as there presumably must be to any Government in the world, under which it can make unexpected arrangements for the release of prisoners.  I can therefore understand the argument that no new law was required and if one could rely on the correct exercise of administrative discretion, using powers already available, there would be no need for a new law.  The commitment made by both Governments was that, first, mechanisms would be put in place to provide for accelerated release; second, prisoners affiliated to organisations not observing a complete and unequivocal ceasefire would not qualify; third, the position in regard to the ceasefire commitment would be kept under review, and fourth, the Governments would seek to enact the appropriate legislation to give effect to these arrangements by the end of this month. On any objective reading, it was intended to be understood by both the electorate and, more importantly, all the parties who signed up to the Agreement on Good Friday that this process would be governed, in both jurisdictions, by legislation introduced specifically for and tailor-made to this purpose, so it was not good enough to say that no such legislation was necessary.  The expectation had been given to everyone involved that it would be introduced.</P>
      <P>It would have been an expected and valid criticism of the Government's position to say that it stood in breach of an explicit commitment which it made in the multi-party talks.  It was important to have this issue rectified by Members of the Oireachtas rather than being exposed to criticism from Northern Irish opponents of the Agreement who could point to avoidance on the part of the Republic of aspects of the Agreement which it does not like.  While we may understand the reluctance of the Department of Justice to legislate &mdash; it prefers administrative discretion rather than being &ldquo;hampered&rdquo; by statute &mdash; it would be easy for others to impute to them bad faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement made specific provision for a prisoner release programme and <Col N="1174" /> setout criteria, which the Minister has scheduled in the Bill, as to how this should come about. Paragraph 4 of the Schedule contains the commitment that &ldquo;the Governments will seek to enact the appropriate legislation to give effect to these arrangements by the end of June, 1998&rdquo;.  I am happy to acknowledge that the commitment was made and is being kept, even if it is marginally late.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of an advisory body, the Release of Prisoners Commission, and stipulates that it should be independent in the performance of its functions.  Its powers relate solely to the giving of advice in relation to those categorised as &ldquo;qualifying prisoners&rdquo; for the purpose of the British-Irish Agreement.  Has the time come to put in place a thorough over-haul of the system of prisoner release in this jurisdiction? Some aspects of the system amount to a running joke &mdash; the Minister knows what I am talking about.  The &ldquo;revolving door&rdquo; still operates but I do not attach personal or political blame to the Minister for that fact.  Both sides of this House must acknowledge that issues relating to prisoner management, rehabilitation and release have received entirely inadequate and unsystematic attention.  The majority of prisoners do not leave our prisons in a state which ensures they can be fully reintegrated into society.  For most of them life outside prison does not open new opportunities for progression into employment and movement into stable and decent accommodation. The revolving door syndrome means that offenders leave prison without adequate rehabilitation and enter a world without the support required to ensure reintegration into a stable society.</P>
    <P>Unless we address the patterns, the system of prisoner release in this jurisdiction will remain inadequate.  I call on the Minister to examine and act on the inadequacies to which I referred.  The system of temporary release was introduced in the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, which empowered the Minister to make rules providing for temporary release subject to such rules, if any, as may be imposed in each case of a person serving a prison sentence.  The Act provides only a bare outline of the scheme and the rules merely set out the formalities such as the form the prisoner must sign and the penalties for any breach of conditions.</P>
    <P>The provision of temporary release was originally intended as a compassionate measure to be exercised sparingly &mdash; for example, attendance at a family funeral.  However, it now forms the basis of a full blown parole system.  We do not have an Act governing parole in this jurisdiction.  Cases are determined on an administrative basis in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the granting or withdrawal of temporary release.  This section of the Act is invoked on a daily basis to release prisoners when prisons become full.</P>
    <P>The failure of the system to cope with the numbers on temporary release accounts for an enormous <Col N="1175" /> proportion of prisoners who are unlawfully at large because they have not adhered to the terms on which they were granted temporary release.  In the past, the Department got away with using temporary release for purposes for which it is not intended.  Prisoners are hardly likely to object and nobody else is really watching. The power to commute or remit sentences is referred to in the Constitution as being vested in the President but is capable of being conferred by law on other authorities.  Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, these powers are exercised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Under that Act, the Minister may commute or remit, in whole or in part, any punishment imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction subject to such conditions as he may think proper.  Although the 1951 Act vested this power in the Minister, it does not set out any rules as to the manner of its exercise, nor does there appear to be any non-statutory guidelines governing the power to commute or remit.</P>
    <P>Commutation or remission is essentially the substitution of a lesser sentence for one imposed by a court.  In capital cases, it is the power which the President used to exercise to reduce a death sentence to one of 40 years' imprisonment.  In the absence of legislation, therefore, everything rests on the nature of the terms which the Minister, at his discretion, thinks fit to attach to each grant as and when, at his discretion, he decides to make such a grant.</P>
    <P>My party supports this Bill.  The onus on this House was to produce legislation which would ensure our compliance with the Agreement.  I am satisfied that the Bill does that.  Accordingly, my party is reluctant to see the legislation amended in a fashion which goes beyond the express commitments in the Agreement.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan that it is important to recognise the role of the prisoners in bringing about the Agreement.  I echo the sentiments of the Minister about the pain and anguish relatives of gardaí who were murdered in the course of duty are experiencing arising from this proposal.  I agree with the Minister that we must understand this concern and not underestimate its importance.  The Minister was right when he said that a difficult judgment has been made.  I hope it works out.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has agreed to honour the commitment given in the British-Irish Agreement to enact appropriate legislation to give effect to the arrangements contained in the agreement for the release of prisoners &mdash; although the Government will have to acknowledge that it has done so only as a result of intense pressure from the Opposition parties.  I am disappointed with the legislation in that the Government has taken the absolutely minimalist approach and has established a commission with few real functions and powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" /> It has to be acknowledged that the release of prisoners is one of the most difficult and controversial areas of the British-Irish Agreement.  It could not be otherwise given the history of shocking crimes committed by paramilitary organisations over almost 30 years.  One can only begin to imagine how the widow of a murdered garda or RUC man, the child who saw a parent murdered by a sectarian gunman, the man or woman whose partner was blown to pieces by a bomb must feel at the prospect of those responsible being freed to walk the streets, without having to complete the sentence imposed by a court of law.</P>
    <P>One can only imagine how those who were injured or maimed and continue to suffer from the effects of violent acts must feel at the prospect of the mass release of prisoners.  For those convicted the slate will be wiped clean &mdash; the victims will continue to suffer.  These victims will have to dig deep within themselves to find the courage and tolerance to cope with the release of prisoners.  The pursuit of the common good of all the people requires that there should be no more victims of politically motivated violence and that the prisons should never again be filled with young men and women, sucked into paramilitary violence.</P>
    <P>The early release of prisoners has been part of the settlement of virtually every political conflict throughout the world and it can be no different here.  There is evidence from previous decades &mdash; as I know from personal experience &mdash; and more recent times that people can and do change in prison.  Prisoners from all sides appear to have been a positive force for good in recent developments. It was striking to see the number of former paramilitary prisoners, both loyalist and republican, involved in the talks in Castle Buildings, and who have now been elected to the new Assembly who were quite determined to ensure that their children would not suffer the same drift into paramilitarism, violent crime and long jail sentences.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent decision of the Government to establish a victims' commission, which will be led by the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action arising from the conflict in Northern Ireland.  I join the Minister in welcoming the fact that Mr. Wilson was willing to accept that role.  In any dealings I have had with the former Tánaiste, I found him to be reasonable, kind and gentle.</P>
    <P>While the numbers involved are considerably fewer than in Northern Ireland, the personal suffering of individuals or families has been no less intense.  One has only to remember the families of those who died in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974.  I hope that the commission will report back at the earliest possible date on measures that may be taken to support and sustain those who have suffered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement of the terms of reference.  They include provision for <Col N="1177" /> those who have suffered and been killed and the surviving relatives of those who have been killed in the service of the State.  I am concerned about the first term of reference which is to conduct a review of services and arrangements in place, in this jurisdiction, to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years.  It goes on to identify further measures needed.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there are republican and loyalist splinter groups, of which the republican element has demonstrated its capacity in recent days to destroy the hearts of towns.  Perhaps it would be wise for the Minister to amend the terms of reference to enable the commission to deal with victims in the future &mdash; we hope there will not be any &mdash; because of the likelihood of the continuation of violence for some time.</P>
    <P>We must make every effort to ease the hurt of the victims of violence, but nothing will wipe out the sense of pain they will feel at the release of prisoners.  A public expression of remorse on the part of those responsible might ease it somewhat. While nothing can ever by done to bring those who died back to life, the paramilitary organisations could demonstrate their bona fides by revealing the location of the bodies of those who were kidnapped and murdered, and whose families were never allowed to give them a decent burial. What possible cause or interest can be served by continuing to make these families suffer?</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am disappointed with the minimalist approach of the Bill.  It is very brief, very general and very vague, especially when compared to the British legislation.  The commission established under Irish legislation will have only a token role when compared to the British commission.  It would have been much more preferable if the same terms and conditions applied to the release of prisoners in this jurisdiction, in so far as this can be done with our differing legal regimes.  The British have introduced comprehensive detailed legislation.  In this country we will continue to rely on single section provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>I am not sure either legislation is entirely appropriate for the current situation.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1960, which is used for the early release of prisoners in cases of overcrowding, was certainly not designed for this situation.  In addition, I understand problems have arisen in regard to the use &mdash; by the last two Governments &mdash; of the Offences Against the State Act and that there is no provision for the rearrest of a prisoner who may break the terms of his or her release.</P>
    <P>I regret also the Bill takes no account of the needs or feelings of victims of prisoners who are to be released.  We will try to address this by tabling an amendment to ensure information on the release of a paramilitary prisoner will be made available to a victim or the family of a victim of the crime for which the prisoner was serving a sentence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> There have been complaints in the past from victims and their families that they were not even made aware when prisoners were being released. Under the amendment I am tabling, a victim or a member of a victim's family would be entitled to request a written statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, specifying whether the commission, established under the Bill, had been asked to consider the case of any prisoner.  A victim would also be entitled to know the proposed date of any release and the terms of any conditions attached to a release.  As I said earlier, the functions and powers of the commission are not set out in any great detail.  It is not clear, for example, what information would be available to the commission in deciding the advice to offer to the Minister in the case of any prisoner referred to it.  I am tabling an amendment to the Bill to ensure the commission would be entitled to request from the Minister or the Commissioner of the Garda details of the offence committed by the prisoner, the impact of the offence on any victim and information on the general character of the prisoner.</P>

      <P>Tugann an Comhaontas Glas tacaíocht don Bille um Cheartas Coiriúil (Scaoileadh Saor Príosúnach), 1998.  I am pleased to see this Bill in print, even if it minimalist, and questions need to be raised about its workability following the uncertainty that surrounded its publication.</P>
      <P>For the Green Party, this legislation is only one component in a process of restorative justice which I hope is under way.  It must be put in the context of proper attention being given to the plight of victims and ending the injustices which have fanned the flames of conflict for so many years.  It must also be put in the context of the removal of the weapons of conflict to rust away or, better still, delivered to a metal recycling plant.</P>
      <P>The basic principle of restorative justice is that justice should make things as right as possible and not simply punish offenders.  If this Bill is taken in isolation, victims will rightly feel ignored and even trodden on by a prisoner release programme. However, if it is taken in the context of making amends for criminal behaviour and accepting a transformed and peaceful social order, the legislation can herald the beginning of a more victim centred criminal justice system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mahatma Gandhi was clear about how restorative justice should work.  During the terrible strife that tore his country, a Hindu man asked him how he could make amends for killing the Muslim parents of a two year old boy.  Gandhi deliberately and slowly thought about the issue &mdash; which for some people would mean serving a long prison sentence &mdash; and told him to adopt another two year old orphaned Muslim and raise him as a Muslim.  While that may not be very relevant in the Northern Ireland context, it serves to demonstrate the depth of imagination which must be part of restorative justice in terms of the conflict. It is a stark contrast to the reality of the disgraceful <Col N="1179" /> and blasphemous arson attacks that happened last night in Northern Ireland.  If restorative justice, as practised by Gandhi, were <i>de rigueur</i> in the Northern conflict, we might have seen happier times and much less loss of life on this and our neighbouring island.</P>
    <P>Nobody claims it is easy.  The nuclear bomb tests in India and Pakistan are a painful reminder of sectarian politics.  On the other hand, prisoners have played a vital role &mdash; which was acknowledged by all speakers &mdash; in helping to bring about the ceasefires and the agreement reached on Good Friday.  The United Nations working party on restorative justice has adopted a working definition for restorative justice.  It states restorative justice is a process whereby all the parties with a stake in a particular offence come together to resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the people who worked on the Maracycle for 15 years in an attempt to bring about a solution to the conflict.  I also express my sympathy to the families of the two cyclists who were killed last weekend.</P>

      <P>I stand in this House today to support the passing of this Bill, to accept the amendment tabled by the Minister and in opposition to the amendments proposed by Deputies Flanagan and De Rossa.  This Bill has been drafted with the clear remit of giving effect to the release of all those imprisoned in this State as a consequence of the conflict that has been waged on and between these islands during the past three decades.  This is in line with the outcome of the recent multi-party talks at Stormont and the ratification by the electorate throughout the island of the agreement reached on Good Friday.</P>
      <P>During my first year as a TD, I have visited jails in every State where Irish republican prisoners are held, in this State, in the Six Counties, in England and in the United States of America. I have met with prisoners who have maintained their political integrity and personal dignity through the worst ravages of abusive regimes, some incarcerated for well in excess of 20 years. I was greatly impressed by their understanding of, and support for, the efforts of my party to set in place and develop the peace process that brought us to the first day of the new Assembly in Belfast yesterday.  This is another step on the journey to a final settlement of the injustices we have all suffered for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Irish republican prisoners, as political activists and not as hostages, have played a key part in the peace process.  I welcome the acknowledgment of that by Members during the course of the debate. I pay tribute to those prisoners, especially to their families who have endured so much.</P>
    <P>The debate on the new British legislation on prisoners was skewed in a most negative direction. I hope that will not be the case today.  We have seen the cynical, selective political and media manipulation of the views of a section of victims of the conflict.  This has been done to resist the principle that in conflict resolution the release of political prisoners is an essential.  Republicans have acknowledged time and time again, and I do so once more, the hurt and pain for which we have been responsible.  We, more than most, know the reality of loss, as we have suffered loss, and more, ourselves.  However, to set victims against prisoners and their families, who have themselves suffered much, is to return to the old mindset of conflict.</P>
    <P>If the conflict is to be resolved and lasting peace achieved then all political prisoners must be released.  No ifs, no buts and no preconditions. Just as there should be no apartheid between victims, there should be no apartheid between prisoners. Sinn Féin will continue to work for the return to their families and communities of all those imprisoned as a result of the conflict.</P>
    <P>A number of outstanding matters need to be addressed, however.  They include the need to end political extradition, the plight of the prisoners in the United States, the uncertainties and fears of those and their families facing deportation from the United States, and the regularisation of the status of prisoners already released here &mdash; those on licence.</P>
    <P>Only a general amnesty can finally resolve these and the other outstanding matters that come under this broad and important area of concern as we move towards a final resolution of the differences that have divided us as a people on this island and that have coloured our relationships with the peoples of the neighbouring island of Britain.</P>
    <P>A spirit that matches the hope and expectation of the overwhelming mass of the Irish people is required here today; not a begrudging, minimalist or selective attitude towards this critical issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for giving me a few moments of his time.  I want to express a different view, certainly from that of Deputy Ó Caoláin and perhaps the majority of Members in the House.  Like everyone else I welcome the cessation of violence that has occurred but I will not congratulate men and women for having stopped killing their fellow men, as they have done for the past 30 years, both in the North of Ireland and in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given an opportunity to vote, if I am only in a minority of one, I will vote against the Bill.  For <Col N="1181" /> 30 years we have witnessed the appeasement of terrorism and, in my book, murder is the ultimate crime.  The Bill, which is being brought forward in accordance with the British Government, makes a mockery of the rule of law.  It is a gangster's or terrorist's charter.  Is anyone in this House naive enough to believe that the last person has been killed in this country?</P>
    <P>In the history of this State 16 gardaí and five soldiers have been murdered by the IRA.  Unfortunately, with the arrival and growth of liberalism we seem to have forgotten the victims of the most appalling crimes that have been committed in Western Europe since the days of the Gestapo in Germany.</P>
    <P>There must be a voice for the victims of crime, of all creeds and denominations, who have suffered horrendous deaths.  We are giving a clear signal to people who will undoubtedly engage in violence in the future.  One has only to look at the bomb in Newtownhamilton last week and the death of a Protestant person who was battered to death in Bangor.  There must be some sensibility to the business of ruling.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have witnessed the total appeasement of terrorism.  People who have committed atrocious crimes have their own command structures in jail.  I refer in particular to that day in September 1979 when 19 young boy soldiers were butchered in Warrenpoint, County Down. On the same evening, Earl Mountbatten, two 14 year old boys and an old lady were done to death on southern Irish soil.  Twenty three deaths in the one day from an organisation that has besmirched the name of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Punishment must always be kept for people who commit crimes.  Some deterrent must be maintained by the governing body for those who take life by murdering.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on the case of Mr. McArdle, the Crossmaglen man who received two years imprisonment for taking the lives of two unfortunate coloured men who were selling newspapers.  A year for each life; is that what we are coming to?  People in England receive higher sentences for fiddling their taxes.  Lester Piggot got three years in prison, yet this gentleman got only two.  He coldly plotted this premeditated crime.  He went on a dummy run to England, three weeks before he committed that crime, to ensure that everything was in order.  Those two men are in their graves along with hundreds of others in this country.  Will nobody stand up and speak for them, except in an ambivalent way by cloaking it all up and saying that we must accept this for the sake of the peace process?</P>
    <P>We all welcome the peace process, but I will hold a watching brief for many years before I am convinced the participants in that peace process are sincere and genuine.  I hope they are, but we are still left with the question of justice for the victims &mdash; the forgotten people.  I knew some of them, like Tom Oliver who was butchered and done to death in County Louth.  He left seven young children.  Did that family ever receive an <Col N="1182" /> apology?  While I know the Minister is only part of the system which produced this Bill, how can he or I explain it to them?  What can one say to those people?  Fancy words were expressed at the victims' funerals.  We deplored the violence but now we are now preparing to let people out of jail who conspired to take people's lives every week of the year in recent years in the North of Ireland and occasionally here also.</P>
    <P>I object to that and I object to murder.  I do not believe anybody or any cause has the right to wrap the green flag round them and say they did it for Mother Ireland.  This assembly should have the guts to realise that.  I realise that had my party been in power, somebody else would have been bringing the Bill through the House.  As an individual who has consistently expressed opposition to all forms of terrorism &mdash; there is no difference between orange and green &mdash; I record my opposition to the Bill.  If I am given the opportunity to vote, I will vote for sanity and the rule law and order to be upheld by voting against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  There was widespread welcome for the Bill.  We can tease out the reservations expressed about some of its detail on Committee Stage this afternoon.  Deputy Flanagan said a wide range of questions must be addressed and dealt with on Committee Stage.  I assure him we can tease out whatever suggestions he makes at that stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not give any new power of release to the Minister or the Government.  Existing powers of release have proved adequate in the past to allow successive Governments to deal with such releases.  It is difficult to see any valid reason to call them into question now.  One possible approach would be to list a set of detailed criteria on releases but that would involve needlessly seeking to define in law what is meant by particular provisions of the Agreement.  That is neither necessary nor desirable.</P>
      <P>We have taken the straightforward approach by specifying that the releases in question should be made only by reference to the terms of the Agreement, which allow account to be taken of the seriousness of the offence and the need to protect the community.  Many of the specific factors people mention might be taken into account or subsumed by those concepts.  I agree with Deputy Upton who recognised that it is not desirable to seek in the Bill to go beyond what is in the Agreement.  Deputy De Rossa suggested there should be a change in the terms of reference given to the former Tánaiste in relation to victims.  I will look at that suggestion to see if it can be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents just one element of my Department's continuing involvement in the peace process.  The British-Irish Agreement has significant implications for my Department across a range of policy areas for which it has primary responsibility within the public service.  These <Col N="1183" /> derive from those provisions of the Agreement dealing with rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, decommissioning, security and the constitutional changes presaged by the nineteenth amendment of the Constitution, in addition to the provisions for prisoners.  A number of commitments made by the Government in these areas will, therefore, fall to my Department to take forward. It is appropriate to detail some of them briefly in the context of this debate.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in giving effect to a number of commitments made in the Agreement. The Employment Equality Bill has been enacted and regulations were made on Monday of this week under the Decommissioning Act, 1997, which provide for the decommissioning schemes recommended by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning and endorsed by the participants in the multi-party negotiations. Other issues related to the Agreement currently being addressed by my Department include the establishment of a human rights commission, which is intended will be a statutory body underpinned by legislation, and the review of the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1985, on which I intend to bring proposals to Government in the near future for the purpose of establishing a review mechanism.</P>
    <P>Speaking in this House on the motion approving the Agreement on 21 April last, I stated my belief that it could prove to be a turning point in the history of this island.  I also indicated that I believed it offered a unique opportunity for all sides to put their past differences behind them and to work together for the future development of the island as a whole.  Events since then, including the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement in referenda North and South on 22 May and the outcome of last week's Assembly elections, have confirmed my view.  It would be foolish to pretend that everything will go smoothly at first on the long and difficult road on which we have set out, but it is important that the Agreement continues to be implemented in the spirit of partnership, equality and mutual respect in which it was negotiated.  This Bill is another step on that journey.  I look forward to progressing this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. David Trimble on being elected First Minister in the North and to extend warm congratulations to my friend, Mr. Seamus Mallon, on his election as Deputy First Minister.  Mr. Mallon has played a crucial role in bringing about peace on this island and he can safely be regarded as one of the greatest Irishmen of his generation.</P>

      <P>Before going into the broad outline of the Bill, it would be useful for the information of the House if I gave the background to the need for it and the reasons urgent, but temporary, measures are necessary to respond to a critical situation.</P>
      <P>The High Court found on 12 June this year that the procedures adopted to enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discharge adequately the obligations imposed by the Firearms Act, 1925, in granting firearm certificates to non-resident hunters are ineffective and insufficient. The judgment followed a judicial review sought by the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  The High Court found also that the procedures followed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in granting hunting licences to non-residents which they must first obtain in order to be granted firearm certificates are also ineffective and insufficient.  The effect of the judgment is that both Ministers are precluded from issuing hunting licences and the consequential firearm certificates to non-residents. The granting of licences and firearm certificates ceased with effect from the date of the judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In arriving at his judgment, the learned judge made a number of important points which are worth repeating here.  The statutory obligations in the Firearms Act, 1925, relevant to the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents impose certain requirements on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Firearms Act, 1925, requires that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be satisfied that a non-resident <Col N="1185" /> seeking a firearm certificate is not a danger to public safety or to the peace and is not a person declared to be disentitled.  The following are declared to be disentitled: a person under the age of 16; a person of intemperate habits; a person of unsound mind; a person sentenced by the Irish Courts in certain circumstances and a person subject to the supervision of the police or bound to the peace in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>While the Court found that the obligations could be described as onerous and, in certain instances, difficult to comply with, if not impossible, they are statutory, couched in unambiguous terms and, accordingly, there is a legal requirement to comply with them.  While evidence was offered of the existing procedures followed to comply with these onerous and rigid obligations, the court found that, having regard to the rigid but unambiguous nature of the statutory obligations, the procedures did not so comply.  The procedures referred in evidence to the High Court included requiring confirmation from an applicant of a European firearms pass, for example, or of a firearm certificate or permit issued in an applicant's country of residence. They also included checks with the Garda authorities in relation to non-residents convicted of crimes and, in addition, evidence of permission to shoot on land within the State.</P>
    <P>There are broad and significant implications arising from the judgment, not only for overseas visiting shooters but also for the issue of firearm certificates generally.  The advice available to me is that the case for new legislation in this area is a compelling one.  Ideally, any new legislation would address the broad implications of the judgment and effect significant amendments to the Firearms Act, 1925, and to the relevant provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which would ensure that the necessary firearm certificates could be issued expeditiously with the minimum of administrative inconvenience.  There are also key public policy considerations to be addressed in any proposals for change to ensure that firearms and their use remain under strict control.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I propose to establish immediately a review group comprising representatives of the key agencies in this area with a view to producing a comprehensive analysis of what is required and how it is to be achieved.  The group is to be tasked, as a matter of urgency, with bringing forward proposals in this sensitive, but complicated, area following a full review, having taken account of the views of the major sectional interests, including those of the National Association of Regional Game Councils.</P>
    <P>In responding to the difficulties which have arisen since the High Court judgment was delivered, I have met representatives of various groups affected or concerned by the judgment including representatives of the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  There is an appreciation on both sides of the difficulties which each of us face and an acceptance that what is required is a fair and balanced approach which achieves a <Col N="1186" /> solution which recognises the interests of all.  By that I mean the interests of both the domestic and out-of-state shooters, the conservation and wildlife interest groups, the promoters, the tourism, sporting and business sectors and the public interest which is concerned with safety and security elements.  It is for these reasons I am establishing the review group.</P>
    <P>However, to bear fruit any detailed consideration of an area as complex and as sensitive as that of firearms controls will obviously require some time.  In the meantime, the Government is acutely aware that an administrative paralysis during which hunting licences and firearm certificates are not issued to non-residents has profound implications for the overseas shooting tourism business.</P>
    <P>Overseas shooting visitors are significant contributors to the tourism sector.  Bord Fáilte has estimated that the sector is worth up to £21 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see that in any of the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am aware that some of our domestic organisations have queried that figure, over 8,000 firearm certificates issued to non-resident shooters in the past two years.  I am informed the sector is exceptionally high yield, attracting visitors in the off-season.  A number of prestigious tourism establishments have made substantial investments in building up their businesses, spending money on such matters as game farming and upgrading.  While it is difficult to put an exact figure on the numbers employed directly, there is no doubt employees in the hotels and shooting estates, as well as &ldquo;beaters&rdquo;, farmers and animal feed manufacturers, for example, would be affected by any serious downturn in business.  Allied to that is the fact that this potential growth area is competing with other countries for this developing business and I am aware that, if the business were to be lost for this year in the months ahead, it is almost certainly lost for years to come, if not forever.</P>
      <P>In light of those important considerations, it was decided that a two stage response is essential to deal with the matters raised by the High Court judgment.  First, the establishment of a review group as I outlined and second, the introduction of temporary legislative measures to deal, in the short-term, with the urgent and critical issues which arise not only for the tourism sector but also for the whole economy.  Failure to issue hunting licences and accompanying firearm certificates is having an immediate effect on the tourism shooting industry and on persons who make their livelihoods in that area of the economy.  Because of that the Government agreed urgent temporary measures are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some points in the Bill which I will emphasise.  This is an interim measure to allow hunting licences and firearm certificates to issue to non-residents pending consideration of more <Col N="1187" /> comprehensive proposals from the review group mentioned earlier.  The Bill specifically provides that the Act shall expire 12 months after the date of its passing, subject to the possibility of one, and only one further extension if that is considered absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, it should be noted that in practical terms the provisions of the Bill do not change the procedures which have been followed for some years under different Governments in issuing firearm certificates to non-residents.  While the Bill proposes to amend, on an interim basis, the statutory provisions governing the limitations and restrictions for granting firearm certificates, in real terms it gives effect to the existing pro-cedures in recognition that the statutory obligations are effectively difficult to meet and, in some cases, impossible.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said the Bill will effectively mean that non-residents will be able to bring firearms into this country with virtually no checks being made.  I refute that suggestion categorically. The provisions of the Bill do not dilute the existing procedures.  In granting firearm certificates to non-residents, regard has always been had to the preservation of the public safety and the peace. That was always the overriding consideration. The measures proposed in the Bill do not change that.  In fact, two additional restrictive measures are included.  These are in section 1(5) which allows the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attach conditions to a firearm certificate and also in subsection (6) where provision is made to allow the Minister to revoke a firearm certificate where he is of the opinion that the holder of the certificate cannot, without danger to the public safety or to the peace, be permitted to have a firearm in his or her possession.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise that the policy &mdash; which in the main has been followed since 1972 &mdash; of restricting the issuing of firearm certificates to certain categories of firearms, is not changed by the Bill.  The policy, which is among the most restrictive in Europe, will continue as before, and provides that firearm certificates will only be granted for shotguns and rifles in certain limited categories.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from what might be described as new restrictions, the Bill provides in section 1 that, before granting a firearm certificate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall be of the opinion that the application is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate.  For the purpose of establishing that there is no good reason for refusing a firearm certificate, the Minister may seek evidence of a European Firearms Pass where the applicant is resident in an EU member state, or any other documents relevant to firearms issued by an appropriate body outside the State or the Minister may make such inquiries as he considers appropriate, such as inquiries from the Garda Síochána or other police services if it is <Col N="1188" /> considered necessary and possible to do that to determine suitability in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The European Firearms Pass is a document issued by the authorities of a member state of the EU to a person lawfully entering into possession of and using a firearm.  The pass is a non-transferrable document on which is entered the firearm or firearms possessed and used by the holder of the pass.  The pass is required to be always in the possession of the person using the firearm and changes in the possession or characteristics of the firearms must be indicated on the pass as well as the loss or theft of a firearm.  I emphasise these aspects of the Bill to illustrate that there is no question of non-residents being allowed to bring firearms into this country without proper checks being made on their suitability.</P>
    <P>This legislation will expire 12 months after its passing and the fact that the broad implications which arise from the granting of firearms certificates generally from the recent High Court judgment will be addressed as a matter of urgency by an expert review group is assured.  The group will consult widely and seek submissions on what needs to be done.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the Bill I take this opportunity to stress to Deputies that from my perspective it is a temporary measure to deal with the immediate consequences of the High Court judgment on the issue of hunting licences to persons ordinarily resident outside the State.</P>
      <P>The judgment had immediate implications for more than 3,000 such persons who may be expected to apply for hunting licences over the coming months.  Without this amending legislation, it will not be possible for my Department to issue licences to those applicants.  Apart from the problems this would present for the applicants, it would also have very serious implications for those Irish based persons and businesses involved in the provision of hunting facilities and services for persons resident outside the State &mdash; a niche industry that makes an important contribution to the economy.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is necessary, the House will be aware that a much more extensive Bill amending many of the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and addressing other wildlife conservation issues, is at an advanced stage of preparation and I expect to publish it in the autumn.  Meanwhile, the implications of the High Court judgment are being examined by me and my Department with a view to ensuring that the provisions of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, when introduced, will address all relevant matters relating to the issue of hunting licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard, and as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform mentioned, I recently met representatives of the National Association of Regional Game Councils and listened to their views on this matter.  Having met representative <Col N="1189" /> of the association on a number of occasions since, and before my appointment as Minister, I am very aware of their concerns and of the concerns of their members throughout the country.</P>
    <P>However, while I am anxious to deal with the legitimate concerns of hunters, both Irish based and those resident outside the State, I must be conscious of my statutory obligations as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in regard to nature conservation.  I assured the representatives of the association that the Bill before us today would be of limited duration and that, from the wildlife conservation point of view, the issues raised by them would be considered in the context of the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  In that context, a further meeting between representatives of the association and officials of my Department has been scheduled for next week to discuss further the concerns of the association in relation to that Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: This Bill is irresponsible. It has been hastily drafted and has not been properly thought through.  It is also probably unconstitutional in that it discriminates in favour of EU citizens over and above Irish citizens.  If implemented in its present form, it effectively compromises public safety.  I am sympathetic to the interests of tour operators who promote shooting and hunting holidays and I am appreciative of the people who benefit from the annual 3,000 foreign visitors, as the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands stated, or 4,000 foreign visitors, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated, who they bring here.  Again there is absolutely no consistency here.  However, the safety and security of the individual must take precedence over all other considerations.</P>
      <P>In 1992, handguns were used in the murders of 97 people in Switzerland, 128 in Canada and 13,220 in the United States.  In 1991, 38,317 people were killed by firearms in the US in homicides, suicides and accidents involving firearms. That is more than 100 people per day.  It is also more than the total number of Americans who died in battle in the Korean War.  Firearms kill more people between the ages of 15 and 24 in the US than natural causes.  Those figures were the statistics for six years ago.  I do not have the latest figures, but the indications are that the statistics have increased dramatically and we all recall the horror of the recent spectacular high profile juvenile murders of classmates, teachers and parents. Each death was caused by a single gun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Televising the aftermath of a major tragedy in a small town US high school has again reduced the world to a global village.  I am sure the residents <Col N="1190" /> of Dunblane could never in their wildest dreams have envisaged that the nightmare of a US class hall would one day be transposed to their tranquil corner of rural Scotland.  The unfortunate reality is that what happens in Dallas yesterday can be a reality in Dunblane today or in Dundalk or Dungarvan tomorrow.  Violence is on the increase and there is a direct relationship between the ready and easy availability of guns and the increase in violence, either against others or against oneself.</P>
    <P>We must, therefore, tread cautiously when it comes to amending gun laws, particularly if, by amending, we mean relaxing the rules.  I am also extremely sceptical of Government promises to the effect that this is just a temporary measure to facilitate in the short-term the 3,000 or 4,000 visitor applicants for firearm certificates and hunting licences.  It is worth recalling that a temporary measure introduced in 1972 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Des O'Malley, led to the handing in of thousands of rifles for inspection. The measure is still in force today and the rifles lie rusting in the Department of Defence vaults at the Curragh.</P>
    <P>This Bill would never have been necessary if the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands had discharged the responsibilities imposed on them by the Firearms Act, 1925 and the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The 35 page judgment of Mr. Justice Quirke on 12 June last is a withering denunciation of the manner in which the obligations imposed by both Acts on the respective Ministers have been flouted, ignored and set aside.  Both Acts set down specific stipulations in relation to the competence, fitness and suitability of persons to use guns and ammunition. The Firearms Act, 1925, sets down exactly the same conditions for non-resident applicants for firearms certificates as it does for Irish citizens. Section 8 (1) of the 1925 Act lays down those disentitled to hold firearms certificates as (a) any person under the age of 16 years; (b) any person of intemperate habits; (c) any person of unsound mind; (d) any person who has been sentenced by any court in Saorstát Éireann for any crime to penal servitude for any term which has not expired or has expired within five years previously; (e) any person who has been sentenced by any court in Saorstát Éireann for any crime to imprisonment for any term of not less than three months which has not expired or has expired within five years previously; (f) any person who is subject to the supervision of the police; and (g) any person who is bound by a recognisance to keep the peace or be of good behaviour, a condition of which is that such person shall not have in his possession or use or carry any firearm or ammunition.</P>
    <P>The clear and sensible requirements and safeguards in that Act were virtually ignored.  Instead of a thorough check as required by law, the National Parks and Wildlife Service simply submitted to officials of the Department of Justice, <Col N="1191" /> Equality and Law Reform the name and address of each applicant and a description of the person's firearm whereupon a firearms certificate and hunting licence would be issued without any difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister maintained today that the public safety was well served by the manner in which the existing legislation was enforced.  I wonder if the Minister read the 35 page judgment of Mr Justice Quirke in which he interprets the 1925 Act as imposing a clear obligation on the Minister to be satisfied that the applicant for a firearms certificate &ldquo;can be permitted to have in his possession, use and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace. Clearly this requires some form of investigation or inquiry into the suitability of such a person to be in possession of and to use firearms.  No such inquiry or investigation is or has been undertaken . in respect of non-resident applicants for firearms certificates&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, such carelessness where guns are involved borders on recklessness.  It is particularly so when one considers that nine of the 13 European states referred to in evidence in court have not enacted firearms legislation.  There is, for example, no firearms legislation in either Belgium or Switzerland.  There is a huge variation between requirements and standards in the different European countries.  In many states, whose tourist shooters come here, hunting licences or permits are obtainable without difficulty or detailed inquiry.  Often all the applicants must do is produce a document indicating that he or she has permission to shoot over particular lands and the licence or permit issues.  Yet these permits and licences have been accepted at face value here.  No investigation, inquiry or check was carried out by either the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or anybody on their behalf within the country of residence of the applicant.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling the clarity of the judgment, which states: &ldquo;It is clear that the first named respondent [that is, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform] has not discharged his obligation under those subsections and it is admitted on behalf of the first named respondent that no attempt has been made by or on behalf of the first named respondent to comply with the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (f), (g), etc.&rdquo;. Then Mr. Justice Quirke talks about the Minister failing &ldquo;fundamentally to address the obligations imposed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Quirke is equally scathing about the failure of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to discharge her responsibilities to assess, under the Wildlife Act, 1976, the suitability of applicants, particularly having regard to &ldquo;conservation requirements&rdquo;.  In page 34, Mr. Justice Quirke found: &ldquo;no investigations are carried out or inquiries made by the second named respondent or anyone on his behalf in the <Col N="1192" /> country of residence of an applicant for a hunting licence or elsewhere in relation to such application&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Here two Ministers are failing to discharge their responsibilities in an area fundamental to public safety and wild life conservation.  Indeed, Mr. Justice Quirke puts it in context in page 18 of his judgment, where he states that the statutory obligation imposed by section 4(b) of the Firearms Act, 1925 is clear and unequivocal and has implications which relate to the security of the State and its citizens, yet that onerous responsibility was totally neglected.</P>
    <P>We owe a considerable debt of gratitude to the National Association of Regional Games Council which is one of the most responsible and progressive voluntary organisations in the country.  It has 22,000 members in 875 gun clubs.  It digs deep into its resources to promote wildlife conservation. It has set the highest standards for its members and repeatedly tried to point successive Ministers and their officials in the right direction. Not alone has its advice and pleadings been constantly ignored but it has been denied membership of or access to State boards, bodies and councils which purport to oversee the sporting activities to which it is passionately committed. Had it been recognised and listened to, this debacle would never have happened.  It has been well and truly vindicated by the High Court judgment of 12 June.  It did a valuable service in bringing the case to court and focusing attention on a major deficiency and omissions in the implementation of firearms legislation.</P>
    <P>One would imagine the reaction of the Minister and the Department would be to introduce a regime which would impose in a structured fashion the same checks on shooter tourists that we impose on our own citizens but the direct opposite has been done.  The lack of guaranteed checks, the failure to verify the credentials and suitability of shooter tourists and to apply the standards of the 1925 Act which apply to our own nationals is irresponsible, dangerous, illegal and unconstitutional.  It is only a matter of time before this Bill is struck down by the courts.  For that reason the Minister should withdraw it.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is not possible to check the suitability of non-nationals to carry or use firearms without major difficulty.  A procedure could easily be introduced whereby the seven checks or requirements specified in section 8(1) of the 1925 Act could be incorporated on a standard form which would be signed by the applicant and duly stamped by his or her local police authority in the country of origin.  It could then be accepted as bona fide proof of the applicant's suitability to possess and use a firearm and would meet the requirements of the 1925 Act.  I fail to see how there could be a difficulty with this. Holidays, particularly hunting holidays, are not spontaneous.  They have to be arranged in advance.  The flight and accommodation has to be pre-booked.  Access to the land over which one can shoot has to be arranged in advance.  It should <Col N="1193" /> be possible, therefore, to arrange for official verification of suitability to possess or use a firearm which, after all, is the central purpose of the holiday.</P>
    <P>The 1925 Act has stood the test of time well. Instead of attempting to dilute it to suit non-nationals we should encourage other EU countries to adopt best practice.  Instead of relaxing the firearm provisions we should seriously consider revising our gun laws.  It is anomalous that one can obtain a firearm certificate at the age of 16 whereas one must be 17 to obtain a provisional driving licence.  We should strengthen rather than water down the existing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me.  As someone who represents a constituency which relies heavily on tourism, I acknowledge the importance of fishing and shooting enthusiasts.  The existing controls are inadequate, however, in ensuring the sustainable development of the sector.  Many of those who come here on shooting holidays pay scant regard to the rules of fair play in shooting game.  In recent times a tourist was found to be carrying swans in his baggage.  Many tourists will shoot anything that moves, including our protected species.  This must be stamped out.  I am aware of a case where a tourist attempted to shoot a cock pheasant crossing the road.  When he was informed by his Irish guide that he should not do so as the bird was walking his reply was that he was waiting for it to stop.</P>
      <P>The movement of licensed guns in and out of the country presents a serious problem.  While tourists are checked at the point of entry I am led to believe that no checks are carried out at the point of departure to ensure they take their firearms with them.  Can the Minister give a guarantee that this negligence will be brought to an end and proper controls put in place?</P>
      <P>Local gun clubs, the only groups which restock game, do not receive any funding.  The individuals who organise hunting holidays fail to reinvest in restocking game.  This is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue if the sector is to develop. The funds raised by way of licence fees must be reinvested.  Similar problems are being encountered in the angling sector.  Foreign anglers come here to fish for up to six weeks to catch perch among fish which they sell on the Continent. They are able to take their families on holiday to the Canaries on the proceeds.</P>
      <P>The duck hunting season opens on 1 September whereas the pheasant hunting season does not open until 1 November.  Both seasons should open on the same day on 1 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Bad law is law based on a &ldquo;why not&rdquo; or &ldquo;no good reason&rdquo; test.  The Minister said that, unless there is a good reason not to, a licence will be granted.  It is unbelievable that gun licences are issued on this basis.  The existing legislation has stood the test of time well.  The Minister should withdraw the proposals he has put before <Col N="1194" /> the House as they are both bad and dangerous in favour of the amendment tabled by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left and allow the matter to be considered fully.  There has been only one meeting with the NARGC.  This could not be described as proper consultation.  The desirability of this measure should be demonstrated.</P>
      <P>I welcome the High Court decision which upholds domestic legislation.  It does not preclude the issuing of gun or hunting licences to non-nationals who have been made more amenable to Irish law.  The Bill seeks to create two sets of rules, one for Irish citizens and another for non-nationals who will receive more favourable treatment. I seriously question whether this is constitutional. Unlike John Gilligan, Al Capone would have no problems in obtaining a gun licence here. This is crazy.  If one is denied for a good reason, so should the other.</P>
      <P>Is there a need for this Bill?  Is its purpose to encourage and facilitate foreign shooters to come here?  It is alleged the 3,000 foreign shooters who come here each year make a major contribution to the economy.  I seriously question this.  They make a minimal contribution and do serious damage. Bord Fáilte states their contribution is so small it does not maintain a separate heading. The Minister mentioned a figure of £21 million but that is rubbish, the real figure is closer to £1 million to £2 million.  The average stay is two days and they do not stay in fancy hotels, but in bed and breakfast accommodation.  In the part of the country I come from they do not spend £7,000 or anything like it.  A figure of £700 would be nearer the mark.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the <i>modus operandi</i> of agents and shooters.  The agents acquire a number of small but separate pockets of land comprising between five and 20 acres.  They then organise dawn raids on the general area and they trespass and poach on neighbouring property in respect of which they have no rights.  Everything that moves is regarded as a legitimate target.  In one instance of which I am aware, an operator advertised and sold 2,000 acres of bogland over which he had no rights to a series of shooters, native and foreign, who descended on the area like locusts and the slaughter was frightening to behold.  Many species of wildlife were virtually eliminated.</P>
      <P>As already stated, these people regard everything that moves &mdash; whether it runs or flies, is legal game or is part of a preserved species &mdash; as a legitimate target and it will be shot.  Songbirds, blackbirds, robins, thrushes, finches, linnets, foxes, crows, magpies and hares &mdash; in and out of season &mdash; are shot at every opportunity.  Game birds are shot at even when out of range.  Those unwelcome and uncaring tourists to whom I refer award themselves brownie points for shooting at such birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be better off without this form of tourism.  However, if we are obliged by European directives to allow these so-called sportsmen to enter our country, we should make it as difficult <Col N="1195" /> as possible for them to do so.  There should be no lowering of the standards that apply to Irish gun licence holders &mdash; this is proposed in the Bill &mdash; to accommodate these reckless people and the handful of &ldquo;cowboys&rdquo; who organise their activities. The safety and security standards put in place by the existing Act have stood the test of time.  Many Irish people have been refused gun licences for good reason.  However, such restrictions will not apply to non-nationals if the legislation is passed.</P>
    <P>How will we check the bona fides of foreign shooters?  Tourist shooters are more dangerous than the banished species of bona fide travellers who simply travelled three miles to drink porter. The new version of bona fide traveller is much more dangerous because he carries guns.  If the Minister has his way, these people will be granted what are, in effect, automatic licences and they will be free from legal sanction under the law.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>Irish game clubs &mdash; I am a member of one &mdash; do extraordinarily positive work to enhance and maintain the natural wildlife habitat.  Such clubs are to be found in every village and their work has been endorsed by the world famous naturalist, Dr. David Bellamy.  This good work is regularly undermined if not destroyed by the illegal activities of tourist shooters and those who organise their activities.  The wreckers should be discouraged in every possible way by the law.</P>
    <P>The promoters of this savage trade have come up with the most fantastic fictions.  The first is that Ireland will lose £21 million in tourism revenue per year.  As already stated, the real figure is approximately £1 million to £2 million.  The second fiction is that foreign shooters are essential to control pigeons which attack crops.  I know of no crops that are attacked during the hunting season because they are not grown at that time of year.  Amazingly, a spokesman for the IFA gave credence to this nonsense.  There are approximately 250,000 licensed gun holders in Ireland, many of whom are farmers and landowners.  It is not credible to state that they require 3,000 French and Italian shooters to augment their efforts in respect of pest control.  The shooting of animals other than listed game species is illegal. That includes pigeons.  Foreign shooters can only shoot the game listed on their licences unless they obtain a special dispensation.  However, they are not sanctioned if they shoot other animals.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, non-nationals living abroad are not amenable to the sanction of Irish law unless that law allows for their arrest and detention pending trial by the courts.  For example, if an Italian tourist shoots species which are protected under Irish law, such as blackbirds, thrushes, lapwings or swans, the gardaí can seize the dead birds but they cannot take further action because a summons cannot be served outside the jurisdiction and the culprits cannot be arrested or detained.  Therefore, these individuals will remain immune to sanction under Irish law unless that <Col N="1196" /> law allows for their arrest and detention.  Likewise, a landowner who discovers trespassing French shooters on his property is only empowered to order them to leave.  In this instance, the laws of trespass cannot be enforced because a summons cannot be served outside the jurisdiction and the farmer cannot arrest or detain the culprits.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill because it is unnecessary, undesirable and dangerous.  I request that he take time to examine this matter and engage in detailed consultations.  I suggest that he should not walk into a legal and constitutional quagmire and a political row which will overshadow the famous rod licence war.  People have strong feelings about this issue and a court decision preventing these raiders from destroying our wildlife has been welcomed.  To facilitate these people now would be a serious mistake.</P>
    <P>Legislation in this area should provide for equal treatment of all applicants, be they Irish or otherwise, for gun and hunting licences.  Like traders in game, shoot organisers should also be licensed and made liable under the law for the conduct of their clients.  The law should provide for a mechanism to check the credentials of foreign applicants by the police authorities in their country of residence.  There is no reason the checklist operated by the Garda in respect of Irish applicants should not apply to foreign nationals seeking a licence to shoot here.  The law should allow for the confiscation of guns and other equipment and payment of a deposit in lieu of fine in cases where legislative provisions are breached.</P>
    <P>Licence holders should be confined to shooting on the land specified in their applications and their licences should only be valid for the days specified.  Under the current practice, a tourist applying for a gun licence in March is granted one for 12 months.  This crosses the normal boundary applying to the licence period.  Effectively, these people obtain two year licences while Irish people who apply for licences in March are obliged to reapply in July.  This means that foreign shooters can return to Ireland later in the year without giving notice to anyone and they can shoot to their hearts content.  I assure the Minister that they do so because I have seen them in action.</P>
    <P>Irish gun licence holders are limited to possessing 100 rounds of ammunition at any one time while the limit for foreign shooters is 500 rounds. I suggest that the limit applying to nationals should also apply to non-nationals.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine the points put forward by Members.  I speak from experience on this issue because I have seen the individuals under discussion in action.  It would be good riddance to bad rubbish if they stopped visiting Ireland. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will face major problems in terms of the costs involved if she is to repair the damage <Col N="1197" /> these people, who are not controllable, have done to our wildlife.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition parties have come together to propose this amendment because of the grave public concern, particularly among the members of gun clubs, about this Bill. It is being rushed through and the Oireachtas has not been given adequate time to consider it.  It fails to meet the requirements of the judgment of the High Court and it will mean that the licensing requirements for issuing firearms certificates for non-residents will continue to be significantly less stringent than for Irish residents.  This is undesirable on safety and conservation grounds.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a panic measure from the Minister in response to an inevitable High Court decision. The public is surprised at the laxity with which foreigners can bring guns into the country.  Those without a knowledge of this issue will be appalled at the difference between the attitudes adopted to foreign visitors and Irish residents.  Illegally held guns have caused much death and destruction in Ireland but the stringent measures for Irish citizens with regard to guns held legally have been effective.  However, it is unacceptable to apply a different set of criteria to visitors from other jurisdictions where attitudes to gun ownership can be very different from such attitudes in this country.  The Minister is proceeding with a Bill which will reinforce that gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is attempting to push this Bill through without proper consultation.  One brief meeting with the National Association of Regional Game Councils is not sufficient.  That organisation, which has 22,000 members, has expressed grave objections to the Bill.  We do not need to be reminded of the public safety aspects of this issue.  The events in Dunblane, Scotland, are to the forefront in our minds.  It is wrong, pig-headed <Col N="1198" /> and obdurate of the Minister to proceed to put safety at risk unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>What is the country coming to when we have become craven in the face of the tourism industry? Have we lost our faculties when it comes to making judgments on what is in the public good and what is good for tourism?  There is a down side to tourism which we must face up to and address.  If not, we will lose the country's valuable tourism assets.  This Bill is a knee-jerk reaction from the Minister to try to cope with fears that have been expressed from certain promotional interests which are not regulated.  What does it say about our concern for tourism when we do not regulate for bringing foreign shooters into the country or for the promotion of shooting abroad?</P>
    <P>There are serious public safety and conservation implications.  The Minister must have regard to the concerns about conservation shown by the national association.  It has tried to have improvements and changes made over many years.  I do not absolve previous Governments of blame on this issue.  However, to rush through a Bill which will copperfasten injustice and inadequate procedures is the wrong approach.  It will put the Minister at risk of again being brought to court.</P>
    <P>Members have a duty to protect the legislative process from abuse.  This presentation of this Bill constitutes an unacceptable abuse of the legislative process and I ask the Minister to withdraw it. The Independent Members have been silent on this issue, although they represent thousands of members of the national association.  The Independents should live up to their stated independence rather than being voting fodder for the Government.  Let them protect the interests of those in gun clubs and the game councils and the long-term future of this tourism sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin West</i>): This Bill gives overseas shooters the right to shoot game in this country.  The Minister must be aware of the serious complaints already referred to by speakers. I was not joking when I remarked on the Order of Business that songbirds are in dread of this Bill.  Shooters from the Continent are notorious for roaming the countryside and blasting any feathered creature that crosses their path.  It is environmental vandalism of the most grotesque kind.  Whatever justification there may be for shooting game birds, it is obscene that blackbirds, thrushes and smaller songbirds are fair game for these shooters.  With this Bill the Minister will ensure that this practice will continue and that the celebrated dawn chorus will be replaced by a chorus of shotguns bringing destruction to all species of birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the tour operators have the Minister's ear.  They have grossly exaggerated the economic contribution of the shooting sector to tourism.  They must bear responsibility for the abuses which are rampant.  Visiting shooters are officially confined to certain areas to shoot but in practice the acreage involved is too small and <Col N="1199" /> there are not enough game birds in the areas. Consequently, trigger happy tourists seeking value for what they have paid to come to Ireland extend their sights to virtually every species of bird.  They go outside the designated areas and encroach on areas where voluntary groups have made great efforts to protect and develop wildlife.</P>
    <P>It would do no harm to take the gun out of Irish tourism with regard to live game shooting. Clay pigeon and other such shooting could be developed successfully instead.  In putting forward legislation the Minister should have proposed stringent measures to ensure that the rampant abuse of wildlife and the environment which takes place as part of this industry was outlawed. The same rules should apply to Irish citizens as to visitors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party hosted a press conference recently on the subject of the decline in fish stocks.  The occasion of the press conference was a dispute that had arisen between various groups who, in different ways, depend on the availability of salmon for a living.  The question is how an ever smaller cake is to be divided. A resolution has yet to be found.  Among those who took part in the press conference were men who had fished salmon in the rivers of the south-east all their lives by a technique that was originally approved under the Statutes of Kilkenny in the sixteenth century.  They were firmly of the view that wild salmon, a species that regularly produces specimens of 15 pounds and upwards, is now extinct in Irish waters, and what they fish for, in the season that is in it, is ranched farmed salmon which have been released into the rivers and which, individually, weigh between three and five pounds.  I have no reason to doubt the judgment of these experienced individuals.  It seems remarkable that a species so significant and symbolic as the wild salmon, which even features on our currency, has been put to extinction for commercial gain and has been replaced by a paler, smaller kind of shadow species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that the intentions behind this Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill are fully motivated by commercial considerations.  There will be arguments that visitors from EU member states like to shoot things while relaxing and taking the air on holidays in Ireland, and we like to welcome tourists to our country.  However, visitors from certain EU states in particular have carved out quite a reputation for themselves in rural areas for their keen interest in shooting everything in sight during their forays.  Possibly these are visitors from countries where the gun sport culture has been so prevalent in recent decades that there is nothing left to shoot at.  I doubt that the attitudes and behaviour of such people will change or be affected by the passage of this Bill except in the negative sense that they will now be in a position to claim some legitimacy for their activities because they will have been <Col N="1200" /> licensed by the Irish State.  The signal this Bill sends out has the same effect as running an advertisement campaign in the wealth centres of the European Union stating &ldquo;Wildlife for sale. Shoot on sight.  Apply to the Government of Ireland&rdquo;.  Game shooters and anglers understand the environment and respect it, and we should listen to them.  If certain foreigners have a licence for 500 rounds of ammunition and they adopt this macho-Italian outlook, we will see devastation in our countryside.</P>
    <P>This Bill does allow the Minister to attach conditions to any firearms certificate granted to a person not ordinarily resident in the State.  There is a plethora of regulations and restrictions in many areas of the fisheries industry but with very little means of enforcement.  Are we to have the same scenario in regard to the issuing of firearms certificates to trigger-happy tourists?  What provisions have been proposed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and sanctioned by the Minister for Finance to put resources into this area of enforcement, given the failure to enforce the Firearms Act, 1925?  Although this Bill amends the Wildlife Act, 1976, it allows that a firearms certificate may be revoked only where there is danger to public safety or to the peace. These are two compelling reasons for revoking a firearms certificate.  Would it not be equally worthwhile to allow revocation where a person or a group of persons engage in the indiscriminate slaughter of wildlife?  Do children and adults in rural areas where these shooting-party holidays are popular not deserve to be protected from the likely loss of their songbirds and feathered wildlife?</P>
    <P>As individuals and as a society we define ourselves by how we treat the environment and the landscape.  So far we have been relatively poor at protecting the national environment.  This Bill strips away a measure of protection which has been afforded to other dwellers in the landscape, particularly hedgerow creatures such as songbirds. This legislation is a regrettable decision promulgated by Government for regrettable reasons.  I hope the review group will turn it inside out over the coming year, but I doubt they will.  This is bad legislation and the Green Party opposes it.  Mr. Justice Quirke's judgment on 12 June has created an opportunity to review policy in this area.  The Government has treated that opportunity as a threat, prompted by tourism interests.  That is a bad basis on which to rush legislation through this House on the eve of the recess.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for sharing his time.  There is considerable concern about this Bill.  There is a necessity to be careful and prudent in issuing gun licences and, in this instance, we are not being careful enough.  I agree with the Minister's concern for the many tourists who come here for fishing and shooting, but restrictions must be imposed and great care taken in issuing firearms.  I know that Garda superintendents <Col N="1201" /> and sergeants monitor people who have guns, but these are people who are resident in Ireland.  They will not have a proper opportunity to monitor people driving in here in cars, jeeps etc.  They will not be able to see the number of guns being brought into the country or whether they are left here or taken back out, and that is a very dangerous situation, to put it mildly.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the attitude of many people who are coming here.  Let me give an example.  A Frenchman was out shooting when he saw a pheasant running along a lane.  The Frenchman took up his gun to aim at the pheasant. The person with him asked whether he intended to shoot it while it was running, to which he replied that he was waiting for it to stop.  This shows they have no understanding of sport.  In many instances what they are doing is pure slaughter.  There has to be greater regulation.</P>
      <P>The National Regional Game Council, which brings in tourists, makes an effort to monitor what is happening.  It has gillies, there are bag limits and there are specific shooting days.  However, insufficient care is being taken and many birds and animals are being wiped out.  We have to carefully monitor what is happening.</P>
      <P>Let me appeal to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to have continuous surveys carried out.  If some species are endangered every effort must be made to protect them and legislation introduced if necessary. There should be much greater control on tourists in the context of bag limits.  Such bag limits should be reported and monitored and indiscriminate shooting of birds and animals should not be allowed.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House deals with guns.  We have to be particularly careful.  I regret that I am not satisfied that this Bill has the proper safeguards.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this interesting debate.  <i>Prima facie</i> it would appear that the Opposition wish to take the gun out of Irish tourism.  However, a more detailed examination of the position reveals glaring inconsistencies between what they did in Government and what they preach in Opposition. Deputy Higgins quoted liberally from the High Court judgment of Mr. Justice Quirke.  Other Deputies berated me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, on our implementation of the Firearms Act, 1925 and the Wildlife, Act, 1976, and went on to imply that the judgment was critical of us since coming into office.  It would be helpful to all observers to note that the High Court proceedings in this matter were commenced on 4 March l996 when the critics on the Opposition benches were in Government.</P>

      <P>If that situation were to continue indefinitely, pending consideration of the comprehensive measures needed, companies and individuals who have invested heavily would go to the wall.  Allied to this measure I have made it clear I will be establishing a review group to begin work immediately which will examine the broad implications of the High Court judgment for the granting of firearms certificates.  The review group will consult widely.  My intention is to ensure that a balanced approach is developed with regard to what must be done in the area of firearms which will take account of all interests including those of domestic shooters, tourists, sporting concerns and so on.</P>
      <P>In the wildlife context, the provisions of this Bill which relate to the issue of hunting licences to persons from outside the State will be reassessed in the light of the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill due to be published by the Minister in the autumn.  That draft Bill already contains proposed amendments to the regime which has been operating in the area of hunting licences.  I have already made it clear that the temporary provisions of this Bill cannot be construed as liberalising our controls on firearms.  To say otherwise is merely to scaremonger with a view to some perceived political gain.  Procedures followed under different Governments for some years will continue to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity to provide additional restrictions in this legislation in that I may revoke certain certificates if I believe it is <Col N="1203" /> necessary and I may add conditions to a certificate.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has also been made that a police certificate of no convictions should be submitted by each applicant from his or her country of origin and that provision should be made for this in the Bill.  The position is that the Bill provides in section 1(4) that the Minister may make such inquiries as he or she considers appropriate as to the suitability of any applicant.  There is also provision in section 1(3)(b) for the Minister to treat any document duly issued by an appropriate authority as evidence of suitability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said that an applicant should simply indicate on the application form that he or she is of sound mind and temperate habits and that the police force in his or her country of residence should stamp that certificate with a seal of approval.  That sounds fine but experience has shown that police services throughout the world will not provide certificates of character or vouch for the sanity or abstemious habits of their citizens because they do not regard themselves as professionally qualified to do so.  Obviously that presents us with a serious difficulty.</P>
    <P>The temporary provisions of this Bill will maintain our controls over the use and possession of firearms while at the same time protect jobs. These provisions do not reduce the existing measures in any way.</P>

These matters will come before the Oireachtas when the Bill is published. The regulation of tourist shoot promoters is another issue which has been under active consideration in the context of the same Bill and one the Minister is likely to include in it.  That is to say the Minister would perhaps provide for the licensing of tourist shoot operators.  That is something to which the Minister is giving consideration.</P>
      <P>With regard to the shooting of non-game birds, all these species of birds are protected under the l976 Wildlife Act and this Bill does not affect that protection in any way.</P>

      <P>With regard to the argument about putting the money back into the tourist shooter area, that fee is an excise matter and as such is one for the Minister for Finance.  On the question of the powers to take legal steps in regard to abuses by tourist shooters, the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will include powers in this respect.</P>
      <P>A number of questions were raised about the way the sum of £21 million was assessed as being the benefit to the economy annually from tourist shooters.  The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation furnished that figure to me and he in turn received it from Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>I unequivocally condemn indiscriminate shooting and the Wildlife Bill, l976, is being addressed by the Minister.  A review group will examine the position so that for the first time in a long time meaningful changes will be made in the area of wildlife and the granting of hunting licences and firearms certificates.  Irrespective of the criticisms put forward, a considerable number of jobs would have been lost and a considerable number of people put out of business if this measure had not been brought before the House.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the prospect of the law being flouted but I assure the House that, in so far as it is possible, this legislation will be administered effectively by officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The twin aims of protecting jobs and businesses while ensuring the safety of our community will be achieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>Last week the people of Northern Ireland got the welcome opportunity to fill the democratic deficit that has existed there with the elections to the 108 seat Northern Assembly.  The power and responsibilities of Government will now begin to be transferred from London to the elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland. The elections are the first phase in the establishment of the new institutions to be set up under the British-Irish Agreement, which include the Assembly, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the successful conclusion of the Assembly elections.  The election was keenly fought and I convey my congratulations to the leaders of all the political parties.  The people of Northern Ireland have once again come out to demonstrate their support for the Agreement, with three quarters of the seats in the election going to pro-Agreement parties.</P>
      <P>The Government looks forward to working constructively with all the political parties elected to the Assembly.  The Taoiseach and I have already begun a round of meetings with party leaders to discuss the next steps in implementing the Agreement.  Earlier this week meetings were held with the leaders of the SDLP and Sinn Féin. It is hoped to have meetings with the other party leaders in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the referenda and the election have taken place, the priority must be to continue to move ahead with the full implementation of the Agreement.  It remains the responsibility of all the elected Assembly members to make good on the brighter future for all which has been promised by the Agreement.  It is incumbent on the representatives to set the standards of trust and <Col N="1208" /> partnership which will enable Northern Ireland as a whole to achieve the necessary respect, equality, partnership and mutual accommodation between the two traditions.</P>
    <P>We equally hope that all parties will seek to resolve their substantial differences on political issues only within the framework of the agreed democratic arrangements.  I call on all those who opposed the Agreement to respect the will of the people who voted comprehensively to see the Agreement and its institutions established and working on their behalf.  Yesterday the shadow Assembly met for the first time and elected the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Executive.  I congratulate all the Members of the Assembly, and particularly Mr. David Trimble and Mr. Séamus Mallon, and wish them every success in the future. We expect the shadow Assembly to take a very early decision after the summer recess on the definition of the ministerial portfolios, thereby clearing the way for the appointment of the shadow Executive.</P>
    <P>The Government looks forward to an early meeting with the representatives of the transitional Northern Ireland Executive operating in the shadow North-South Ministerial Council and to working to identify and agree by 31 October at least six implementation bodies to be established, and at least six other areas for future co-operation through existing bodies.  It will fall to the two Governments to complete all necessary legislation to enable the implementation bodies to be established on entry into force of the Agreement, which we expect to take place in early 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in wishing well the new First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the Assembly in Northern Ireland. When one church is attacked it is hatred but ten such attacks is organised hatred.  It is clear on this island that we have a great deal of religion but very little Christianity.  I despair at what happened yesterday in Northern Ireland.  Can I take it that discussions are taking place involving, where necessary, the Irish Government, both communities in the North and the British Government to try to resolve the situation in Drumcree?  Is the Minister hopeful that a resolution to the stand-off will be found before the march proceeds down Garvaghy Road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's response.  Everything that can be done is being done by politicians North and South and in Britain to ensuring the Drumcree situation is calm.  The Taoiseach and I have been in contact with our counterparts.  The Taoiseach has been in contact with the British Prime Minister and a few hours ago the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland contacted me.  That contact will be ongoing to bring about a resolution to this problem. <Col N="1209" /> The problem concerns the accommodation of two different traditions &mdash; the right of the Orangemen to march and the right of the Nationalist community to live in peace and harmony. It is the accommodation of those two traditions we seek to resolve.  Everything that can be done will continue to be done to bring about a peaceful resolution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in calmer times we might return to the question of the whole purpose of a march going down a road in this way to a religious service.  I do not wish to add to the difficulties which exist by commenting further, except to say the organised hatred in Northern Ireland indicates clearly that we all need to reassert that what we have is a beginning and we have a long way to go in ensuring the success of the peace process in Northern Ireland.  A great start has been made.  Have the Taoiseach and the Minister had discussions with the new First Minister or Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland since their appointment yesterday?  Is it intended that the Taoiseach and the First Minister will meet in the near future to discuss the peace process and the ongoing difficulties that exist in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been in touch with Mr. Trimble &mdash; I am not sure whether it was in his capacity as First Minister since that happened only yesterday.  Certainly I have been in touch with Mr. Mallon offering him my congratulations on behalf of everyone.  On a personal note I am very pleased and proud for him.  He made a significant contribution to the peace process and that is agreed among all parties.  His negotiation prowess is unparalleled.  I join with the Deputy in condemning the church burnings yesterday.  What its purpose is intended to be remains a mystery to us except to suggest it is intended to sow the seeds of dissension.  It is clear that the place to bring people's differences is to the Assembly, the democratic process.  I condemn the outrage that occurred in relation to the burning of the churches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not address my question as to whether there will be a meeting in the near future between the Taoiseach and the First Minister.  Was the question of the Drumcree impasse raised some days ago at the meeting with Gerry Adams?  If so, will he indicate whether Mr. Adams is among those working behind the scenes to bring about a resolution of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it everybody is working behind the scenes to bring about a resolution of the problem.  The Taoiseach and I will be meeting with the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the next question perhaps the Chair will clarify an issue for me.  It had been understood I was substituting for Deputy Spring this week on matters of foreign <Col N="1210" /> affairs.  Is it open to the House to agree that I would follow Deputy Spring's priority question?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to inform the Deputy that it is not open at this stage.  Notice must be received in the office in time to allow for the Deputy's name to be printed on the Questions Paper.  I have checked with my office and no notice was received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but my understanding was that it had been received as late as last Monday.  The consequence of this would be that I could not agree to Other Questions being combined.  I could not accept, for example, that discussion on Questions Nos. 13 and 14 on East Timor would be closed off.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the position Ireland took in the discussions at the Cardiff Summit, Wales, on access for the Schengen area by Norway and Iceland.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16639/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Norway and Iceland already participate in the Schengen arrangements through the co-operation agreement of 1996 between them and the Schengen states on the abolition of controls on persons at their common borders.  A new agreement has to be concluded with Norway and Iceland as a result of the provisions in the protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty for incorporating Schengen into the treaties.  It was in the context of the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam that the matter arose at the European Council in Cardiff on 15-16 June.  Ireland joined with other member states in looking forward to agreement at the General Affairs Council on 29 June on the mandate for negotiations with Norway and Iceland and in urging their timely completion.  However, the matter was not finalised at the Council on 29 June and is still under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter one of my three priority questions because it is of concern not only to me but will be of great concern to the public when it becomes clear that Norwegian and Icelandic citizens, who are not members of the EU, will have freer access to travel within the Union than Irish citizens.  Have the Minister and his Department looked at innovative ways of <Col N="1211" /> trying to allay the concerns which citizens here will have?  In other words, is it possible by agreement with the Schengen states, without leaving the common travel area, to agree to allow a lesser document than a passport to be used by Irish citizens travelling to the Schengen area or by people within the Schengen area travelling to Ireland?  In some cases it might suit people to continue to show their passport but driving licences, a social security card and so on might suffice.  We are inclined to say we do not have an identity system in Ireland, therefore, we would have to introduce it if we were to seek such an accommodation.  I do not believe that.  Where there is a will there is a way.  If we continue to grind away at this, some accommodation can be found.  I put down a priority question to ask the Minister to find innovative ways of doing this so that Irish citizens can travel in the Schengen area without a passport while we await the British Government's agreement to join Schengen.  Obviously, we have indicated we wish to join.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a fair point &mdash; which he previously raised at Taoiseach's Question Time on 24 June &mdash; referring to the call by the European Council in Cardiff for progress on the mandate for negotiations with Norway and Iceland.  He voiced concern that, as a consequence of that agreement and the Schengen protocol, citizens of those countries would have greater ease of access to the EU than Irish citizens, and suggested that a concession might be secured on the basis that our citizens could travel using an EU driving licence or a similar document instead of a passport.  He also urged the Taoiseach to instruct the Ministers and Secretaries group to continue to examine the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach acknowledged the difficulties mentioned by the Deputy and took note of his comments.  The matter had already been taken up by the group, which directed the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Environment and Local Government, and Foreign Affairs to consider and report on the possibility of adapting or integrating the existing social services card or EU driving licence into an acceptable identity card specifically for use by Irish citizens when travelling in Europe, thereby eliminating the need to produce a passport at entry points.  The Department of the Taoiseach had already taken part in the exercise and the group, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, noted there would be major difficulties in adapting the EU driving licence for use as an identity or travel card, not least that EU legislation would be required to allow part of the licence to be reserved for national use.  The group also felt that, while it would be possible to adapt the social service card, this would involve significant new administrative measures and extra resources.  It concluded that, irrespective of the document <Col N="1212" /> available to Irish citizens for travelling abroad, this would not affect in a practical way the checks to be undergone when crossing Schengen external borders.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is concerned about this matter and at his request I will try to resolve it.  There appears to be a considerable amount of bureaucracy in the conclusions reached.  I do not say that as a criticism of the officials, quite the contrary, they are doing an excellent job.  In the meantime, however, we could look at this again and I undertake to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The golden opportunity is now, while Norway and Iceland are negotiating their access, and we should use that leverage.  I am not suggesting that Ireland should introduce an identity card system, because I do not see a need for it, but that the Minister seeks a facility which would allow a lesser document or a travel identity card&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I began working last year with my colleagues from New Zealand, Sweden and South Africa on ways and means to rekindle the will of the international community for nuclear disarmament. These efforts have now led to the formation of a new coalition of like-minded countries, including those countries with which we have for many years worked in the field of nuclear disarmament &mdash; Brazil, Mexico, Egypt and, more recently, Slovenia, a grouping now described as the New Agenda Coalition.</P>
      <P>This initiative sets out to try to secure a firm political commitment from the nuclear weapon states and nuclear weapons-capable states to proceed with the rapid elimination of nuclear weapons. Once this commitment has been secured we can put in motion the actions that will necessarily follow, with the objective that in a few years we will have consigned nuclear weapons to history, protecting our future and that of our children.</P>
      <P>Given that there is no agreed EU position on the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and that many of our partners are members of military alliances which subscribe to the doctrine of nuclear deterrence, it was clear from the outset that the declaration could not be an EU initiative. However, partners were informed of the initiative in advance and I am gratified the European Council in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June took special note of it.</P>
      <P>The New Agenda Coalition group has injected a new sense of urgency into efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament.  This initiative, announced through a joint ministerial declaration, is particularly timely.  The work of my colleagues and myself predates the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan but however coincidental these recent developments may be, they can be seen as justifying, indeed validating, the necessity for this declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the declaration has received a broad welcome internationally and the European Council at Cardiff took special note of it.  Its full text has been circulated as an official document of the United Nations, of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and of the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.  The relevant non-governmental organisations such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the Middle Powers Initiative have also welcomed it.  In addition, I have received letters conveying approbation and congratulations from NGOs and members of the public all over the world.  Yesterday, at a seminar in Dublin, I outlined to a number of Irish and international NGOs involved in nuclear disarmament the role they can play in promoting this issue.  In my bilateral meetings since the launch <Col N="1214" /> of the declaration I have used every appropriate opportunity to draw the attention of my counterparts to the initiative.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information</i>
    </P>
    <P>While the declaration can stand on its own merits I hope the New Agenda Coalition can use it further to highlight the issue of nuclear disarmament. In my bilateral meetings with other countries between now and the United Nations General Assembly in September I will seek to build support for the declaration and the principles that underpin it.  With my colleagues, I am examining how we might bring this initiative forward at the United Nations.  This could include the tabling of a resolution at the General Assembly designed to focus international attention on the issue and secure the commitments to nuclear disarmament which the New Agenda Coalition has called for in the declaration from the nuclear weapons states and from the nuclear weapons-capable states.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree we need to concentrate on what is happening in India and Pakistan to discourage not only those countries but others which might be planning to explode nuclear devices?  In commending him on his initiative, I ask him to vigorously pursue new nuclear states.  I am also concerned about former Soviet scientists who appear to be available for consultation and who are selling their services and advice and I hope the Minister's initiative will cover that problem.</P>
      <P>Although the Aiken initiative resulted in the non-proliferation treaty, which Ireland was the first country to sign, the big five nuclear powers &mdash; the US, Russia, China, the UK and France &mdash; have done little to meet their part of the bargain, which was to reduce their arsenal so that zero nuclear capacity is eventually reached.  I therefore ask the Minister to concentrate his efforts not only in the UN, as he has indicated he will, but within the EU, and to seek the support of like minded EU countries.  There appears to be movement in Britain and the same may be possible in France.  In the early 1960s we had a great effect and we can have an effect again.  The Minister's initiative has my full support and I hope he will pursue it in both fora.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The initiative results from an appreciation that there has been a lack of progress on nuclear disarmament since the end of the Cold War.  We recognise that a number of steps have been taken, particularly by the United States and Russia.  These reductions are not premised on any decisive political commitment to <Col N="1215" /> eliminate nuclear weapons, but rather they are designed to take account, albeit at a lower level, of the changed circumstances resulting from the end of the NATO-Warsaw Pact confrontation.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government does not accept the rationale of arguments advanced during the Cold War for not implementing the legally binding commitments of the non-proliferation treaty. Such arguments have even less value today. While we had to recognise that during the Cold War the prospects for the elimination of nuclear weapons was constrained by events, now that the threat of that era has passed we cannot stand on the sidelines and watch helplessly as these weapons continue to be maintained.</P>
      <P>In addition to India and Pakistan, Israel is a nuclear weapon capable state.  None of these three nuclear weapon capable states is a non-proliferation treaty party.  We cannot underestimate the extent to which nuclear weapons capability is contributing to tension in both the Middle East and South Asia.  However, while India and Pakistan have both rejected the test ban treaty, Israel has signed the treaty but not ratified it.</P>
      <P>I raised the issue with President Clinton, in advance of his visit to China, during his meeting with President McAleese in the White House last week.  I also discussed the matter with the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which the Ireland House concept is progressing; and if he will extend the approach to more Embassies.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ireland House concept has been most useful in promoting the consolidation of representative offices abroad, in order to ensure the most effective promotion of Ireland's interests.</P>
      <P>As I told the Dáil in reply to a question on 19 February, there is now consolidated representation involving diplomatic or consular missions and one or more State promotional agencies in New York, Tokyo, Moscow, Riyadh, Beijing, Prague, Budapest, Warsaw, Helsinki, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur.  The latest Ireland House is in Madrid, incorporating the Embassy, An Bord Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte, BIM and Bord Bia.  I was happy to perform the official opening ceremony there last October.</P>
      <P>The possibility of extending the concept to other locations and to new forms of co-operation is kept under review in liaison with the State agencies through the Foreign Earnings Committee, which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt.  Any such arrangements must of course be shown to be both useful and cost effective.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that given the developments in telecommunications with the availability of fax, e-mail, mobile phones and computers, the traditional role of an ambassador as an intelligence gatherer and representative of the State has changed?  It is important as we approach the 21st century that our diplomatic service abroad keeps pace with the changes and that the role of ambassadors evolves.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider a change in the designation of ambassadors to enable them to become, so to speak, the chief executive officers of Ireland House?  This will take account of the traditional diplomatic role of an ambassador but will also ensure he or she represents the totality of Irish interests abroad and looks out for opportunities for Ireland.  Does the Minister see any benefits in this suggestion?  The ambassador would be chief executive officer of the Irish mission abroad and would not just be a representative of the Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs but would take a broader, more proactive interest in international issues which could benefit Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Deputy's experience, I am sure he will agree that ambassadors and diplomats are doing a huge service to the country by involving themselves in the trade and economic area.  Today I upgraded the status of our consulates in the United States of America to give them, as the Deputy seeks, an economic bias.  I hope arising from that initiative that what we seek to achieve will happen.  Deputies travelling abroad have found diplomats to be concerned for, and involved in, the economic life of the country.</P>
      <P>The designation of ambassadors as chief executive officers is a matter for another day.  In the meantime, if they carry out the functions of a chief executive officer, there is no need to change their title from that of ambassador to the title suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>On the question of information technology, all the promotional agencies and the Department of Foreign Affairs are on the network.  The main agencies have developed excellent websites. Those of Bord Fáilte, Bord Tráchtála and IDA Ireland have been particularly highly commended. An Ireland House website has been established in Seoul, South Korea.  The Foreign Earnings Committee is currently reviewing the use of information technology and the Internet with a view to ensuring that co-ordinated and effective use is made of new technology in our overseas promotional efforts.</P>
      <P>When I opened the Ireland House in Madrid, I saw the combination of all the facets of Irish economic life under one roof.  This is spreading to most of our Embassies and diplomatic outlets.  In fairness to our offices abroad, they act in an appropriate and patriotic manner on behalf of their country.  I am sure the rest of the House will join with me in paying tribute to their hard work.</P>

      <P>I did not suggest that the designation would change from ambassador to chief executive officer but that he or she would be <i>de facto</i> chief executive officer of the mission abroad.  Anyone who has served in the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot but be impressed at the level of commitment and the calibre of diplomatic staff.  However, in every organisation there will always be those who do not measure up to the same level of commitment or success as their peers.  Does the Minister have systems in place to measure the success of diplomats serving abroad in promoting Irish interests?  If so, are regular reviews carried out to ensure that the activities of our diplomats meet the objectives set by the Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Since the British-Irish Agreement was concluded on 10 April, we have seen two endorsements by the people of the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Ireland.  On May 22, the Agreement won the backing of 85 per cent of all those voting on this island in the referenda, North and South.  This overwhelming endorsement indicated a widespread willingness on the part of the Irish people to set aside the divisions of the past and to seek to resolve their differences on political issues by democratic and exclusively peaceful means.</P>
      <P>On 25 June, the people of Northern Ireland went to the polls to elect their representatives to the 108-seat Northern Assembly.  Once again the people of Northern Ireland have come out to support the British-Irish Agreement with three quarters of the seats going to those political parties which support the Agreement and wish it to work.  I hope that even those who opposed the Agreement will respect the democratic verdict of the people and will make the Assembly work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, the shadow Assembly had its first meeting and elected the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Executive.  It has also set up a Standing <Col N="1218" /> Orders Committee to examine the working practices of the Assembly.  We expect that, after the summer recess, the shadow Assembly will quickly define the portfolios of the Ministers in the new Executive, thereby allowing the very early allocation of the ten ministerial posts to the individual parties.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Northern Ireland transitional administration and the Government, operating in the shadow North-South Ministerial Council, will meet to undertake a work programme to identify, and agree by 31 October, at least six areas in which implementation bodies are to be established, and at least six areas where co-operation will take place separately through existing bodies.  It will then fall to the two Governments to complete all necessary legislative and other arrangements to enable the implementation bodies to be established on the entry into force of the agreement.  Intensive consultations are taking place between Government departments in preparation for our forthcoming discussions with the shadow Executive.</P>
    <P>All of the new institutions set up by the agreement reached on Good Friday will be formally established on the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement.  The timing of this is dependent on the enactment in both the Irish and British jurisdictions of all the necessary legislation.  The legislative process may not be completed until early next year, though we shall do our utmost to accelerate matters.</P>
    <P>The Government has also established an interdepartmental steering group of senior officials, chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, to co-ordinate and actively move forward the implementation of all aspects of the agreement, which remains the overriding priority of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Andrews, and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, on their tremendous success in the peace process.

When will the implementation bodies be set up and will they have initiation powers?</P>

      <P>A very active committee, headed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is examining those matters.  Work in ongoing on all the areas required to be implemented under the British-Irish Agreement.  I support the thrust of the Deputy's question.  It is important that we concentrate on the interparliamentary aspect of the multi-party agreement.  I am sure the Deputy will agree the interparliamentary body set up under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement worked exceptionally well.  It brought together British and Irish parliamentarians to break down suspicions.  It brought together groups of people who did not know one another.  I was a founding member of that interparliamentary body which did, and continues to do, magnificent work.  I would like to think this would be an addition to, rather than a substitute for, that body.  I am glad the Deputy asked that question.</P>

      <P>Given the need for inclusiveness in Northern Ireland, I am sure the Minister will agree the PUP and the UDP made an important contribution to the peace process to date.  While I join the Minister in welcoming the meeting of the shadow Assembly yesterday, it was a poor day because of the absence of representatives of the UDP, in particular, Mr. Gary McMichael.  Will the Minister try to find a role in the process for him as he represents an important strand in the process?</P>

      <P>I agree Gary McMichael made an enormous contribution to the peace process. On a personal note, I am disappointed David Adams was not elected.  I do not wish to ruin his political prospects in the North, but I got on extremely well with him.  I also had very good relations with the so-called loyalist political parties who were present.  It is unfortunate Gary McMichael was not elected.  I will take account of what the Deputy said and continue to bring him within the atmosphere of the process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the Department's promotional role, the SMI Strategy Statement of the Department of Foreign Affairs for the period from 1998 to 2000 states that its task is &ldquo;to promote and protect the interests of Ireland and its citizens abroad and to pursue peace, partnership and reconciliation on the island of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the mission statement makes clear, the Department has an important responsibility for the promotion of Ireland internationally, and this is a matter of the utmost priority for the Department and its missions abroad.  This overseas promotional role influences every aspect of the Department's work.  My official visits abroad have a significant promotional dimension.  For example, the first overseas visit I made as Minister for Foreign Affairs in October last was to Madrid for the opening of an &lsquo;lreland House&rsquo; there.  This brings the embassy and the various State agencies together under one roof with a view to optimising Ireland's impact in Spain.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic and consular missions are devoted to the overall pursuit of Ireland's interests abroad.  They work with others in the public and private sectors to expand trade and tourism and to attract inward investment to Ireland.  Embassies and consulates strive to enhance Ireland's profile in their host countries, for example, through information work and media briefings.  Recent examples include our embassies' active involvement in promoting the British-Irish Agreement and the Government's recent nuclear disarmament initiative, which contributed to enhancing our image internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the second part of the Deputy's question, the Tour de France in Ireland comes within the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  However, the Irish Embassy in Paris has been very active in promoting the Irish aspects of the Tour de France 1998 in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the organising company for the Irish portion of the tour and other State agencies.  The embassy's involvement has taken the form of hosting, and participating in, promotional events and providing briefing for the media.  The embassy was involved in the following events: 4 April 1997, the announcement of Irish stages of the tour by the Minister for Tourism and Trade at a lunch hosted by the Ambassador in Paris, Mr. Patrick O'Connor, at the embassy.  There were 70 guests, including journalists; 4 and 5 July 1997, the Ambassador in Paris participated in the prologue and opening events at Rouen of the Tour de France in 1997 to promote the Irish opening in 1998; 27 July, dinner at the embassy in Paris hosted by our Ambassador in honour of the Minster for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, to mark the conclusion of the Tour de France 1997 and to promote the Irish aspect of Tour 1998.  Sixty <Col N="1221" /> people attended including journalists; 23 October 1997, Ambassador and embassy officials involved with Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Bord Fáilte and Bord Bia in launch of Tour de France 1998 at the Palais de Congre s, Paris; 6 November 1997, Ambassador O'Connor hosted Bord Fáilte's presentation of its 1998 holiday programme to the French travel trade, with an emphasis on the Tour de France and the Year of Sport in Ireland.  It was attended by 80 members of the French travel trade; 2 March 1998, lunch at embassy hosted by the Ambassador for key personalities involved in the Tour, including the director general of the Tour de France, Monsieur Jean-Marie Leblanc.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above specific events, the embassy is involved in an ongoing basis in briefing journalists and others, and in the promotion of the tour in co-operation with the organisers and State agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree Ireland has suffered greatly over the years because of the violence in Northern Ireland which constantly sent out the vibe internationally that somehow this was an unattractive location to visit or in which to invest?  Every time a bomb went off in Northern Ireland a picture of Ireland went up on the television screen and people who did not know the scene here got this bad message. One way of counteracting that is to ensure that major social, political and cultural events are held here and reported on from here so that the international community can see Ireland for what it really is.</P>
      <P>When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin I set up the Dublin international sports council with a view to bringing major sporting events here.  Mr. Pat McQuaid and I sought the Tour de France as one of those events.  Does the Minister see a role for our embassies in pursuing that objective and, in particular, in trying to bring events like the European and World Athletic Championships here? People say we will never be able to host them, but would the Minister agree that cities like Gothenburg, which is half the size of Dublin, have put on these events because every organisation in Sweden, including Government Departments, is organised to seek such events and bring them to Sweden.</P>
      <P>We seem to think it is a good idea to send representatives off on trips abroad, which I have no particular objection to, provided they bring something back.  Does the Minister see a role for the Department of Foreign Affairs in seeking to secure these major events for Ireland because it helps to counter the 30 years of negative advertising we have had?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I see an enormous role in the Department of Foreign Affairs for bringing about what the Deputy seeks.  However, in fairness, this country is not barren of conferences of one sort or another across a broad spectrum, for example, medical and agricultural conferences. The Deputy will agree that at this very moment <Col N="1222" /> it is difficult to get a bedroom in a Dublin city or county hotel or other hotels in the main cities.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland problem impinged on the image of this jurisdiction in the sense that people looking at the North did not realise the difference between North and South and, consequently, we suffered.  However, all is now well on that front.  As far as the Department of Foreign Affairs is concerned if a request comes to bring a sporting event to Ireland the door is always open. There is enormous co-operation, as I have just indicated, in relation to the Tour de France and the central part played by the Irish embassy in Paris.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will remember, in his time as a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, the enormous success and key role played by the Department of Foreign Affairs in the <i>Imaginaire Irlandais</i> exhibition in 1996 which was a huge success and raised Ireland's profile not only in France but on the Continent generally. I take the Deputy's point.  It is certainly something we will continue to pursue</P>

In the course of her speech, the Tánaiste mentioned that she always encourages our diplomats to involve themselves in trying to extend business links and encourage companies to come here.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to question the magnificent contribution the Department of Foreign Affairs and its officials have made over the years.  Will the Minister agree, however, that at a time when global has become local, there might be a role for former politicians or high profile sporting personalities to take up the role of ambassadors in some countries?  I am not purporting to find a role for him, but I am thinking of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who has said he will stand down at the next general election.  Would the Minister agree that Deputy Reynolds would make a fine ambassador to the United States?</P>

      <P>The question of career diplomats arose in the past and it has never been pursued. On balance, I do not see a future for it.  We have very highly trained and motivated people in the Department of Foreign Affairs who, when they are asked to take on a job as ambassador on behalf of the country, do it extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the economic drive and trade continues to be addressed in the Department of <Col N="1223" /> Foreign Affairs.  Only today I raised the status of consulates in America in the very context which Deputy Mitchell raised &mdash; developing economic links and trade with the areas these consulates operate in.  Some of them on the west coast of America, for example, preside over part of America which is even bigger than some of the countries which have diplomatic representatives to Ireland.  That is the reason I upgraded their status.  In anticipation of that, those people who will be appointed to those consulates will be given training with ABP, Bord Bia and Bord Fáilte before they take up their functions and duties as managers, chief executive officers or diplomats.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 25, 33, 36, 48, 49 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>The deteriorating situation in Kosovo is a matter of grave concern for the Government and our EU partners.  Armed conflict is spreading with an increase in the already serious loss of life.  Ethnic cleansing, involving both communities, has become widespread, creating greater numbers of displaced persons within the province and refugees in the adjoining countries, particularly in Albania and to a lesser extent in Montenegro. Hostage taking on both sides is occurring with greater frequency; the number of undisciplined, armed militias is on the increase and there are reports of the rounding up and detention of persons.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International has drawn attention to widespread abuse of human rights on both sides. All of this provides grim reminders of Bosnia. Apart from the enormous human suffering involved, the spread of armed conflict makes it increasingly difficult to put in place what is urgently needed, namely negotiations and political dialogue between the sides.</P>
      <P>On 23 June the House heard a report on the deliberations of the Cardiff European Council of 15 June as well as a report on the meeting which took place in Moscow on 16 June between Presidents Yeltsin and Milosevic.  The Contact Group of six countries has been playing a key role in efforts to persuade Belgrade to co-operate and, in this context, the influence which Russia, as a member of the Contact Group, can bring to bear on President Milosevic is extremely important.  At their meeting on 16 June, Presidents Yeltsin and Milosevic reached agreement on a number of points.  These, with some notable exceptions, corresponded largely to the demands set out in the Cardiff Declaration relating to the resumption of dialogue, greater access to the province by international observers and humanitarian organisations and the return of refugees and displaced persons.  The notable exceptions did not cover the withdrawal of security forces engaged in the repression of civilians nor the involvement of international mediation in negotiations, as demanded by the European Council.</P>
      <P>In the period since 16 June the situation on the ground has considerably deteriorated.  At the same time, intensive efforts have been made by the United States, through their representative Mr. Holbrooke, to bring about meaningful negotiations. Unfortunately, these efforts have not yet produced results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the grim background against which the deliberations of the GAC1 took place last Monday. With the moderates being eclipsed by more militant elements, the common ground on which negotiations can take place becomes more difficult to find and the demands more extreme.  It is clear that the escalation of conflict could have horrendous consequences in human terms, not <Col N="1225" /> only in Kosovo but also in terms of spillover effects in the neighbouring countries of Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
    <P>The Council deeply regretted the Serbian leader's refusal to accept an increase in the size of ECMM &mdash; the European Community Monitoring Mission &mdash; in Kosovo, especially as he had earlier undertaken to allow full freedom of movement in the whole territory of Kosovo as a confidence building measure.  We will seek to achieve this through increasing the diplomatic personnel of member states' embassies in Belgrade.  We also reiterated the need for a comprehensive approach to the refugee issue and our intention to work with international organisations to promote the early return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes.  This is another issue on which President Milosevic gave a clear commitment at Moscow, which he should now honour.</P>
    <P>On the humanitarian side, the Government has already provided £50,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for Kosovar refugees in Albania.  The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has announced a package of aid worth ECU 1.5 million for Kosovar refugees and their host families in Albania. Other donors have also responded generously to appeals for assistance.</P>
    <P>While the initiative in recent days seems to have passed to the advocates of violence, the promotion of peace and justice in Kosovo still depends on the establishment of genuine dialogue between the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians. It is, therefore, equally incumbent on all those in a leadership role in the Kosovar Albanian community to unite responsibly in making clear their commitment to dialogue and a peaceful resolution of the problems of Kosovo.  They must also reject violence in all forms.</P>
    <P>I and my EU colleagues also firmly believe that the OSCE has a vital role to play in this process. Deputies will be aware that Mr. Felipe Gonzalez has been appointed as Special Representative of the Chairman in Office of the OSCE for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and that he has in that capacity taken over the role of the High Commissioner for National Minorities.  The Council reiterated its full support for Mr. Gonzalez and called for the early return of the OSCE long-term missions to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  I hope that President Milosevic will now honour the undertaking in respect of the OSCE which he gave in Moscow.</P>
    <P>As regards the status of Kosovo, the EU position remains that the Union supports a special status, including a large degree of autonomy for Kosovo, within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is a question which must ultimately be agreed between the Serbs and the Kosovars.  Mr. Milosevic's rejection of any role for the EU or other international bodies in promoting negotiations on this issue has resulted in a situation in which if the militant Kosovars succeed in achieving <i>de facto</i> independence for all or most of <Col N="1226" /> Kosovo, the basis for further consideration of Kosovo' s status will have changed radically.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Security Council also remains seized of the question of Kosovo.  I expect that after the next meeting of the Contact Group, scheduled for 8 July, it will be in a position to consider further the situation.  I also expect the next meeting of the General Affairs Council under the Austrian Presidency on 13 July to consider further the response of the EU to developments.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that Kosovo was left aside in all the formal negotiations up to now and that there is now a great deal of guilt?

      <P>I am concerned that Kosovo is a powder keg which could explode and cause huge problems outside its territory.  While accepting that we need to make every effort to find a peaceful solution to this problem, does the Minister accept that one can only deal with bully boys, such as President Milosevic, by force?

      <P>Does the Minister agree that what is happening in Kosovo may give rise to the need for peacemaking as distinct from peacekeeping? Does he also agree that Ireland's position <Col N="1227" /> in influencing these events is retarded by the fact that we continue to insist on not participating in Partnership for Peace?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's involvement in peacekeeping and peacemaking and our non-membership of PFP will not prejudice whatever role it may be called on to play.  We have not been found wanting in the area of peace.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald wanted to know if everything was being done to resolve this issue.  Every time this issue is raised within the EU, I make a contribution and will continue to do so in a moral context.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe suggested, President Milosevic is a war criminal and is less than a nice person, to put it mildly, who should be tackled under an EU resolution.  In the meantime, the EU has taken a number of initiatives, including an arms ban and a ban on equipment that could be used for internal repression or terrorism. These measures also have the force of a United Nations Security Council resolution.  The EU has imposed an additional ban on visas for senior former Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbian officials involved in oppression, a ban on Government financed export credit, a freeze on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's assets abroad, a ban on new investment and a ban on flights to the EU by Yugoslav Airlines which was adopted by the European Union on 29 June last.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins raised a good question. He suggested that Felipe Gonzalez should take on a new persona.  He has been offered by the Chairman in Office of the OSCE as a mediator, which was refused, and the EU has offered him as an interlocutor.</P>

In the meantime all I can do, and no doubt the House will join me, is condemn the problem of the arms industry.  Those who operate it have very little morality.  I can only surmise that if people pay the highest price they will get the best weaponry.  I will leave it at that.  Some member states might look into their hearts in regard to the point raised by Deputy De Rossa.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;section 3(2)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subsections (2), (3) * and (4) * of section 3&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are contingent on favourable recognition of amendment No. 4 and I will concentrate my comments exclusively on amendment No. 4 which deals with what does or does not constitute a qualifying prisoner for the purpose of the Act.  I sought some clarification from the Minister on Second Stage and I take it he did not have an opportunity during his five minute reply to that Stage to respond in sufficient detail.  In his opening address he referred to the Agreement.  If he did not say it, he implied that he did not wish any aspect of the Bill to go beyond the Agreement.  From my party's point of view, there is no suggestion Fine Gael would seek to go beyond what is contained in the historic Agreement.</P>
      <P>Regarding the section on prisoners in the Agreement, the section the Minister included in the Schedule is far from specific.  Paragraph 4 was included in the Agreement to allow the Governments put a greater amount of detail into the Bill before us and, while we are supportive of it, it is weak.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 attempts to define a qualified prisoner for the purpose of the Act.  I hope the Minister will deal with my concerns on this matter.  The definition needs to be specific.  Will the Minister confirm if we are dealing with an amnesty, early release, a commutation or a licence?  It is of extreme importance that we get this right.  As a precondition of any release, there should be a method by which the prisoner involved has an opportunity to renounce violence and give an undertaking to that effect.  It is only fair and reasonable in the circumstances that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about people who will be released, having been convicted of the most <Col N="1230" /> serious terrorist offences the law recognises.  If there is to be an amnesty, it is only right it should incorporate a disavowal or a renunciation of violence by the prisoner concerned.  Does the Minister envisage these releases will be undertaken on a collective basis or will there be an individual prisoner release mechanism?  He might deal with that when we come to discuss the commission. As a minimum, we should deal with people who, having spent some time in prison and who will benefit as qualifying persons, should have renounced violence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of amendment No. 4 deals with the organisation that persons may at some stage have been associated with, affiliated to or supporters of.  The Schedule goes some way towards dealing with that point, but it is not sufficient.  I hope there will be no provision under which persons, who are members of an organisation which has not established a ceasefire, would be considered for early release.  That relates to a problem that I briefly addressed on Second Stage on which I wish to press the Minister, that of persons who may wish to be considered as qualifying prisoners and who may have departed from the organisation to which they were at some previous stage affiliated. There are a number of such people, who have declared that they have left the INLA.  How does the Minister propose to deal with them on the basis that the organisation in question has not declared a ceasefire yet an individual who may have been involved wishes to extricate himself or herself from the membership of that organisation? If there is no appropriate method employed, it will mean these people will not only be prisoners of the State but of the organisation and they will not benefit under this Bill.  I hope the Minister can deal with that in his reply.</P>
    <P>The latter part of amendment No. 4(4) deals with the specific regard the Minister should have when deciding on a release, which again is contingent upon whether the Minister will employ an individual, case by case, release mechanism or a collective release mechanism.  If it will be on a case by case basis, will the Minister consider the seriousness of the crime?  Will he examine in detail whether the person is involved in an organisation which is now committed to the use of democratic and peaceful means?  That is important in the context of having appropriate safeguards.  This morning Members from all sides of the House recognised and acknowledged that this is a difficult question.  It is a serious and sensitive matter.  Therefore, it is important that the Bill includes the type of safeguards envisaged in amendment No. 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments seem to be based at least to a significant extent on provisions in the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill, 1998.  What I have to say should not be interpreted as a comment or criticism of that legislation. It must be understood that that legislation arose in the context of a requirement to introduce <Col N="1231" /> legislation in that jurisdiction so that the release powers would be available to enable effect to be given to the provisions of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>However, the position in this jurisdiction is very different.  As I explained on Second Stage, the release powers already exist in law to enable us to give effect to the contents of the Agreement in relation to the accelerated release of prisoners, and that point has been generally accepted.  It should not then surprise anyone that the approach we are taking in this Bill should differ substantially from that which was taken in the UK legislation.  What we have done is introduce legislation appropriate to the legal environment in which we operate in this jurisdiction.  It is not appropriate to attempt to transplant to that structure some of the provisions of the UK legislation.</P>
      <P>The central approach taken in this Bill is quite straightforward.  In effect, it provides that in considering cases for release regard must be had to the relevant part of the British-Irish Agreement, and that part of the Agreement is included word for word in the Bill.  It seems to me that approach keeps faith with the people here who voted overwhelmingly in favour of the terms of the Agreement and, as far as I can see, no case has been made to add a gloss in this Bill to the terms of the Agreement.  The dangers inherent in attempting to do that are clear from these amendments.</P>
      <P>For example, the amendment seeks to define a qualifying prisoner as a prisoner who has renounced violence and undertakes by way of declaration not to engage in any unlawful activity in the future.  I know that it is not the intention but, on the face of it, the amendment would mean that any armed robber in Mountjoy Prison, for example, whose actions had nothing to do with the northern conflict, could purport to renounce violence and make a declaration not to engage in unlawful activity in the future.  Under the terms of the amendment, that person would qualify for release under the British-Irish Agreement.  I know well that is not the intention but it illustrates the difficulty of putting a gloss on the Agreement by putting forward well intentioned but needless amendments.  There are dangers in seeking to put a gloss on the Agreement.</P>

    <P>The amendment goes on to state that any person affiliated to or supportive of any organisation which has not established or is not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire shall not be a qualifying prisoner within the meaning of this Act, but the relevant part of the Agreement, which is scheduled to the Bill, states that &ldquo;Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from the arrangements&rdquo;.  It is difficult to see what advantage there would be to that part of the amendment given the approach taken in the Bill.  Under the Bill, it will be a matter for the Minister of the day to deem whether a prisoner is a qualifying prisoner for the purposes of the Agreement.  Such <Col N="1232" /> a matter is clearly a matter for the Executive and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day is uniquely well placed to have regard to all of the relevant considerations which fall to be considered under the terms of the Agreement.  There is no legal requirement or advantage in this jurisdiction in seeking to enshrine in law what would, in effect, amount to an interpretation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>I will make the general point, with which I am sure everyone will agree, that the legislation is not about raising fences or moving goal posts, or even about being perceived to do that.  It is intended to, and must as a matter of necessity, reflect the terms of the Agreement.  In this context, it must faithfully reflect the terms of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there is any great difference between any of us as to what we are trying to achieve in giving effect to the Agreement.  I fully accept the bona fides of everybody in the House in this respect, but I hope Deputy Flanagan will accept in turn that the approach taken in the Bill is the correct one and that the amendments which he tables are undesirable for all of the reasons I outlined.</P>

      <P>One of the issues underlying this amendment is the concern that once a prisoner is released under the Offences Against the State Act or the Criminal Justice Act, there is no basis on which that person can be rearrested unless he or she commits another crime or is found guilty in the courts of committing another crime.  I do not remember the details but I recall an incident when in Government where a released prisoner was found in suspicious circumstances and the Garda Síochána were not in a position to rearrest him and bring to an end the release procedures which had been implemented. This raises the question of the conditions to be attached to the release of prisoners in these circumstances. Is there a way in law under the Offences Against the State Act or the Criminal Justice Act to rearrest a person who may be in breach of the conditions set for his or her release?</P>

      <P>I agree with the line taken by the Minister.  The Agreement which may not be perfect &mdash; I presume it has its limitations &mdash; has been accepted.  To reinterpret, qualify or modulate it would not be desirable.  That is the reason I, on behalf of the Labour Party, have not tabled amendments to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed my concerns.  Is he prepared to provide the House with the methodology he will employ in determining who is a qualifying prisoner?  He appears to suggest this is an executive function and that he will be the exclusive arbiter.  I am not certain that is what was envisaged by the Agreement. There is a need for transparency.  Are we talking about an individual or collective release <Col N="1233" /> mechanism?  Will the Offences Against the State Act or the l960 Criminal Justice Act or both be employed?  The seriousness of the crime and the political motivation of the individuals involved should be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he is happy to deal with the matter under the Agreement which states that an organisation should maintain a ceasefire.  What methods will he employ to assure the public that he is happy an organisation is maintaining a ceasefire? Between Christmas and 10 January when there were a number of murders committed the situation in Northern Ireland was precarious, delicate, sensitive and appalling.  They were terrorist offences, yet organisations were maintaining a ceasefire.  There has been an outbreak of terrorist activity in the Border area.  Will the parties involved claim they are maintaining a ceasefire? Can one maintain a ceasefire while engaging in horrific punishment beatings on a daily basis?</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to make a judgment on whether an organisation is maintaining a ceasefire to allow members of that organisation to go free.  Is it freedom without conditions and sanctions? On Second Stage the Minister rejected the notion of licence.  What safeguards is he prepared to introduce to meet a fair degree of public concern which would be met by amendment No. 4 which he regards as inappropriate because what it proposes is unknown in this jurisdiction?  He should specify the aspects he deems to be inappropriate and unnecessary and state why.</P>
      <P>What mechanism or approach will the Minister employ to facilitate members of an organisation who have renounced violence and wish to extricate themselves from it to avail of the status of qualifying prisoner?  The difficulty, as I understand it, is that they will not be given what has become known as non-aligned status.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Upton, that there is no alternative but to follow the terms of the Agreement faithfully.  This has not been stated by other speakers but it is what they think. That leads us to the question of the method to be employed and the safeguards which require to be inbuilt.  The Agreement refers to the release of prisoners convicted of scheduled offences in Northern Ireland or similar offences outside it. Amendment No. 4 reads:</P>
      <P>(3) Qualifying prisoners shall be prisoners who have renounced violence and who have undertaken by way of declaration not to engage in any unlawful activity in the future.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 of the Schedule to the Bill is specific. It states:</P>
      <P>Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from the arrangements.  The situation in this regard will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be a matter for the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1234" /> Equality and Law Reform of the day, who will have access to the relevant information, to decide whether prisoners qualify for early release.  In answer to Deputy Flanagan's point, a prisoner does not have to be a member of a particular organisation to benefit from the procedures.  To use the Deputy's words, a prisoner will not become a prisoner of a particular organisation under the terms of the legislation as drafted.  In any event an individual would have had to have been convicted of a scheduled type offence.  A prisoner would not be excluded on the basis that he or she was no longer a member of an organisation.</P>
    <P>Blanket consideration will not be given to a collective number of prisoners' cases.  Each case will be considered individually.  The agreement excludes from the scope of the scheme only prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire.  I hope this will help to allay people's concerns about this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa raised a number of interesting points in respect of this unique legislation. He asked whether an individual released pursuant to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, can be rearrested for breach of a condition or conditions of his or her release.  That raises the question of whether a condition or conditions can be imposed under the terms of the 1939 Act in the first instance.  These are interesting questions. However, there is no jurisprudence which I regard as settled in respect of this matter.  Deputy De Rossa will be aware that the issues to which he referred have not been tested in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, have been used by successive Governments to release prisoners at different points in the history of the State.  It must be stated, however, that the exercise of the power of release under the 1939 Act is the Government's prerogative.  Releases under the 1960 Act are the function of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day.  The relevant provisions allow for conditions to be placed on release.  I will consider whether release under the 1939 Act or the 1960 Act is appropriate. However, that consideration will have to take place on a case by case basis and, in that context, I will take the advice of the commission I propose to establish pursuant to the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flanagan and De Rossa inquired whether we will use the 1960 Act or the 1939 Act. The 1960 Act will be used in the majority of cases because the majority of prisoners at issue have been repatriated and, therefore, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, would not be applicable to them.  In those circumstances the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, will apply.  Cases involving repatriated prisoners or capital cases cannot be considered under the provisions of the 1939 Act and they will have to be dealt with under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa and I could embark upon a <Col N="1235" /> philosophical discussion on the provisions of the 1939 Act but such a debate would have no great effect because, as already stated, I am unaware of any settled jurisprudence in that area.  I assure him there is no doubt in my mind that a breach of conditions under the 1960 Act could lead to a legitimate arrest.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of numbers, etc., the majority of the prisoners under discussion have been repatriated.  When one excludes these individuals and those imprisoned for capital offences, only a small number of prisoners' cases would come under the terms of the 1939 Act.  I hope I have addressed Deputies' concerns.  If not, I will try to deal with further queries as they arise.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to amendment No. 4.  I do not want to seek a division on this issue.  I regret that the Minister does not see fit to incorporate the amendments in the legislation.  Is he prepared to give an undertaking that, in the context of making a decision, he will have regard to the points included in the amendments, particularly in respect of the renunciation of violence? The agreement refers to prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a ceasefire.  This means that the organisation of which prisoners are members must have declared a cessation of violence before early release will be granted.  What is the Minister prepared to consider as far as individuals are concerned? Is there a method he proposes to use to assess the individual involved rather than or as well as the organisation of which he or she is a member?</P>
      <P>In the context of the second part of amendment No. 4, will the Minister give an undertaking that he will have regard to the status of paramilitary organisations and ensure that they are committed to the use of democratic and peaceful means to achieve their objectives?  Having regard to the fact that the Minister does not consider the amendment to be of sufficient importance to be incorporated in the Bill, is he prepared to say that in the context of securing a method to define &ldquo;qualifying prisoner&rdquo; he will take the import of the amendment into consideration?</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Commission may, if it considers it necessary to do so for the purpose of performing its function under this Act, request the Minister to furnish to it information specified in the request, being information that is in the possession of the Minister or may reasonably be procured by him or her, and the Minister shall comply with such a request.</P>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 3 in response to amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy De Rossa. Deputy De Rossa's amendment provided that in considering a request for advice, the commission may request from the Minister or the Garda Commissioner such information as it considered necessary in regard to any qualifying prisoner, and went on to give an indication of some of the types of information at issue.  It is implicit in the Bill that, where the Minister sought advice from the commission on prisoners, it would be incumbent on the Minister to provide the commission with all the information it needed so as to be in a position to respond to the Minister's request.  It has to be borne in mind too that under the Bill one member of the commission would be an officer of the Minister and another a member of the Probation and Welfare Service, and it would be expected in practice that they would be able to obtain or supply whatever information was needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I saw Deputy De Rossa's amendment I recognised that it might be best to put the matter beyond doubt, and I consulted with the parliamentary draftsman.  Accordingly, my amendment provides that the commission may, if it considers it necessary to do so for the purposes of performing its functions under the Act, request the Minister to furnish it with requested informationwhich <Col N="1238" /> is in the possession of the Minister or may reasonably be procured by him, and the Minister shall comply with such a request.  I believe this meets the point raised, through his amendment, by Deputy De Rossa.  I am grateful to him for tabling the amendment.  In the circumstances I hope he will be in a position to withdraw amendment No. 8.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I move amendment No. 4a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) In requesting the Commission to give advice regarding qualifying prisoners, the Minister shall request the Commission to have regard to whether the crimes of which the qualifying prisoners were convicted were inspired by sectarian hatred.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a natural part of the peace process that follows civil conflict of the scale and intensity we have had on this island for many decades that the release of prisoners would be integral to it.  It is characteristic of any conflict that the release of prisoners who are in prison as a result of the conflict, for whatever reason, will always be part of the settlement.  I agree with that process, and I agree with the proposals coming forward that advancing the peace process has to involve the release of prisoners.</P>
      <P>However, we should not uncritically accept legislation putting this into effect without looking more closely at the nature of the prisoners because they can be of different character and have differing motivation.  In general wartime situations, there may be people who were dragooned into the service of their armed forces and felt they had to serve in that regard, and there may be outright war criminals.</P>
      <P>Regarding the situation we face here, from the socialist perspective that I bring to this Dáil, the 30 year paramilitary campaign was unjustified in every sense.  There was no political or other justification for it.  It was always to be politically doomed.  It should have been clear from the republican viewpoint that, apart from the morality of it, one million Protestant people could not be bombed into a united Ireland.  However, we recognise that young people, North and South, did get dragged into the conflict, many of them as a result of overwhelmingly political motives. From the point of view of youth with republican views, the civil rights experience and the nature of the repressive regime that obtained in the North was a motivating factor.  Their motives were well meaning, even if the means they adopted were wrong and doomed.  These are the people for whom a prisoner release programme would be designed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the republican paramilitaries there were <Col N="1239" /> also those who are guilty of nakedly sectarian atrocities.  The Whitecross massacre of nine or ten Protestant workers in the late 1970s is one atrocity that stands out dramatically.  Similarly, people from a loyalist paramilitary background had different motivations.  Some felt they were protecting civil rights, but others were guilty of nakedly sectarian atrocities of the most horrific kind. In reviewing the situation of prisoners, that motivation has to be looked at with a view to ascertaining what role released prisoners will play in society in the future.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that people can change. There are people now leading the peace process in the North on both sides who have changed very much in 20 years in their political viewpoint. They regret deeply many of the actions they or the organisations in which they were involved carried out, and they are attempting to play a positive role.  We have to allow that some have not really changed.  I would be particularly worried about people who were motivated mainly by sectarian hatred which is what gave rise to terrible suffering in both Protestant and Catholic communities over the past 30 years and affected this State as well.</P>
    <P>The release programme has to assist a continuing peace process.  Therefore, people will need to be reassured and be confident that anybody who may have been motivated by sectarian hatred has changed and will not hold the view that at some stage they may take up that line of action again. For example, when there are heightened sectarian divisions, even in the situation that obtains in the North at present, people want to be reassured that none of those who are convicted of sectarian crimes will, when released, again foment sectarian crimes because it is communities, working class communities in particular, which have suffered and which will suffer again. The commission should take these issues into consideration when advising the Minister under this Bill.  That should be a factor in the release of prisoners to ensure that crimes committed against ordinary people will not be repeated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to take up a point made by Deputy Higgins. I do not make the distinction he makes between murders carried out by paramilitaries, allegedly for political reasons, and those carried out by people who went out and killed others, choosing their targets simply on the basis that they believed them to be Catholics or Protestants. The sad fact is that most of the people killed by the Provisional IRA were Protestants and it is very difficult to distinguish between one motivation and another.  I might add that some of the most horrific sectarian killings were carried out by some of the people who participated in the <Col N="1240" /> negotiations.  They played an important role in those negotiations and have moved away from the type of activity they were involved in during the 1970s.  It is difficult in the first instance to distinguish the motivations behind these killings and it would be important not to seek to do that.</P>
    <P>It is important that the commission would have regard to the mental state of the prisoners who will be released into our society.  I do not know whether any of these people are in Irish prisons but I have no doubt that some of those involved in these killings were psychopaths.  We will need to be extremely cautious about the judgments we make with regard to releasing prisoners who may have a mental disturbance in addition to using the cover of political motivation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>The purpose of the commission is to give advice on release of prisoners by reference to the provisions of the relevant part of the Agreement which is included in a Schedule to the Bill.  This amendment would require the commission, in addition to taking into account whether crimes of which the following prisoners were convicted, were inspired by sectarian hatred. It is not appropriate to require the commission to do any more or any less than have regard to the relevant terms of the Agreement and in the circumstances I cannot support the amendment.  The commission will take into account in line with the Agreement the seriousness of the offence and the need to protect the community.</P>
      <P>While no one would disagree with Deputy Higgins's views about the despicable nature of sectarian crimes, it would be wrong to see this Bill as an opportunity to seek to qualify what is provided for in the Agreement by reference to the motive for a particular offence.  In any event, that is something on which it would be impossible for the commission to decide.</P>
      <P>I emphasise again that the Schedule is quite specific in so far as the point raised by Deputy De Rossa is concerned.  The question of the mental state of an individual and whether he was a psychopath, while not specifically set out in the legislation, is nonetheless covered by the Schedule which states categorically in the text, which is taken from the Agreement, that account would have to be taken of the seriousness of the offences for which the person was convicted and the need to protect the community.  Deputies will accept that the fact that the need to protect the community is included in the Schedule to the legislation offers reassurance that people with the capacity which Deputy De Rossa outlined would not be released.  I hope that sufficiently explains the position.  I trust that in regard to Deputy Higgins's points he will understand and withdraw his amendment.</P>

The unity of working class people and the coming together of communities across the sectarian divide is the only way forward.

      <P>&ldquo;(2) In assessing cases for release the Minister shall have regard to</P>
      <P>(a) the nature and seriousness of the offence,</P>
      <P>(b) the likely impact of the release on the community, and</P>
      <P>(c) the behaviour and characteristics of the qualifying prisoner.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Some of the points raised by Deputy Higgins in the debate on his amendment could be met by part (c) of my amendment which refers to the behaviour and characteristics of the qualifying prisoner.  Indeed, I agree with much of what Deputy De Rossa said in regard to that amendment.</P>
      <P>Obviously the definition of the qualifying prisoner will allow for the accelerated process under the Agreement.  As the Minister stated, that will be a difficult decision and one that will cause great concern for those victims who have been on the receiving end of the most appalling violent activity, some of which was perpetrated in this jurisdiction.  I hope the Minister will have regard to the points made in the amendment.  It is important that such an amendment would be enshrined in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the nature and seriousness of the offence is concerned &mdash; this point was referred to earlier by Deputy Higgins &mdash; the reality is that the Sinn Féin Party, with which most if not all of the qualifying prisoners have had an association, has not expressed any remorse or apologised to the victims.  That is in stark contrast to the comments made by the people representing loyalist terrorist groups.  I am thinking in particular of the manner in which Gusty Spence conducted a press conference announcing particulars of the loyalist ceasefire.  His behaviour and the content of his utterances on that occasion were in stark contrast <Col N="1242" /> to the colleagues of Deputy Ó Caoláin who was in the Chamber this morning.  For that reason, it is important that the import of the amendment would be taken on board by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the nature and seriousness of the offence, and the likely impact of the release on the community, not long ago we had a public statement from the Sinn Féin representative, Mr. Martin Ferris, who expressed confidence about the release at some future stage of certain individuals who have yet to stand trial.  I ask the Minister, in the context of the amendment, how he proposes to deal with persons convicted of capital murder.  Will they be treated the same as those who have not been convicted of such an offence?  How does the Minister propose to deal with the likely impact on the community of the release of a person convicted of capital murder?  Is he prepared to consider the behaviour of such a qualifying prisoner within the prison regime or the attitude of that individual, for example, towards the ceasefire?  Given the Minister has not clarified to the extent I would have wished what he will take into consideration in determining whether a person is a qualifying prisoner, and the fact that the commission is merely an advisory body and may not take this into consideration, it is important the Minister allows his Office to be charged with the specific duty of care this amendment imposes on him. Anything less could give rise to serious concern within the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which crystallises what is happening in regard to prisoners. The Minister recently had a visit from the representatives of a family affected by the capital murder of a garda and he is aware of the sensitivities involved.  That family recently broke its silence to a local paper and outlined its concerns. With much emphasis on the prisoners issue in the past, not enough has been spoken about the victims of horrific tragedies.  The Minister issued a letter &mdash; I appreciate the way he expressed his views &mdash; stating that no category of prisoner will be excluded from consideration as part of the review process.  The reason is that it was quite clear during the very intensive discussions that took place on prisoners' issues that if those convicted of capital murder had been excluded completely from the review process there would have been no Agreement.  I am surprised at the contents of that letter which was sent to the family involved.  I am surprised Sinn Féin could have such a degree of clout that the overriding concern as to whether the Agreement would be delivered seemed to hinge on the capital murder of four gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that people are awaiting trial for the horrific murder of Garda McCabe in the Limerick area, much will depend on how we approach the release of prisoners and equate the seriousness of the crimes with the release.  It is important to bear in mind the genuine concern of the family involved.  In his amendment, Deputy Flanagan <Col N="1243" /> refers to the likely impact of the release on the community.  How would any of us feel if a person who had murdered a father, as in this case, returned to the community and lived two miles from the victim's married daughter?  That would have a traumatic effect on a family.  While Sinn Féin may have said that if this was not included there would be no Agreement, it must have been very difficult for the Minister, and the officials, to agree to such a request in the context of past events involving gardaí, particularly Garda McCabe.</P>
    <P>How can we consider prisoner release in isolation given the signals that would send to the people who, in the case of Garda McCabe, are waiting to be sentenced?  I fully endorse Deputy Flanagan's comments.  The commission, and the Minister, should take into consideration the nature and seriousness of the offence as well as the effects such release would have on the immediate family.  The family who met the Minister outlined their concerns about the release of the person who murdered Garda Seamus Quaid.  The Minister is aware of how those people feel.  They also arranged a meeting with our leader, Deputy John Bruton, to outline their position.  I often wonder whether the victims are taken into consideration. As I said at a parliamentary party meeting, the people we are talking about are not in prison for stealing sweets from an old lady's shop but for very serious offences.  For that reason I support the amendment.  It makes good common sense that it should be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this amendment primarily because it is important there is discussion about these aspects of the possible release of prisoners.  It is not an attempt to rewrite the Agreement reached on Good Friday. This House is dealing with the methodology of putting in place the Agreement.  A number of matters require to be dealt with in that regard.</P>
      <P>I was appalled at Deputy Ó Caoláin's contribution this morning.  He had a golden opportunity, when speaking about the release of prisoners found guilty of the most horrific crimes, to say sorry on behalf of the Republican Movement, but he did not take that opportunity.  The furthest he was prepared to go was to say; &ldquo;I acknowledge the hurt caused by us&rdquo;.  That is fine, but it does nothing for the relatives of the victims in terms of acknowledging the pain caused which, unfortunately for the people concerned, does not go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin indicated that there ought to be no preconditions, which is one of the Sinn Féin mantras, but in recent years Sinn Féin set many preconditions to its ceasefires and its involvement in the political process, and all those preconditions have been met.  The least we can expect in terms of the release of prisoners, some of whom will be released shortly after they have been sentenced, is that they should be obliged to comply with criteria for common decency.  I ask <Col N="1244" /> the Minister whether one of the conditions that might be applied to a prisoner's release is denial of that person's right to live in proximity to the victims or relatives of the victims of their crimes. This is one aspect of a condition that might be applied to a prisoner release.</P>
    <P>The other is that no contact would be made by the released prisoner with the victim or relatives of the victim unless he was invited to do so.  Those are basic common decency provisions in light of the extremely generous way in which the State is dealing with the issue.  We, as a democratic parliament, are in an invidious situation where people have been arrested in this jurisdiction and others and transferred to prisons in Ireland as a humanitarian gesture.  People in this jurisdiction are serving sentences for relatively minor offences compared to the offences for which these prisoners were convicted and they will serve their full sentences.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for a democratic parliament to maintain the independence of the Judiciary and the courts system and take legislation through the House in this manner.  We are treading on eggshells and it is important, therefore, to give all the reassurances necessary to the victims and the public that these are extraordinary circumstances, but that concern will be had for the feelings of those who suffered at the hands of those who will be released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  We have asked on numerous occasions in the House for a humanitarian approach to prisoners.  On this occasion we ask for such an approach to victims and those who have lost relatives and friends, who will probably see those convicted released within two years.</P>
      <P>I know the family of Séamas Quaid in Limerick, referred to by Deputy Finucane, and they have grave concerns about the proximity of the prisoner to them when he is released.  I agree with Deputy De Rossa that there should be protection and conditions laid down whereby prisoners do not live adjacent to victims or their families or have uninvited contact with them.  The hurt involved for those who have lost loved ones runs deep and it is stressful and distressing for them.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that a concession was made in this area.  It appears it is a <i>fait accompli</i> and the arrangement is agreed, but it is important to stress the feelings, sensitivities and distress of the families.  I spoke earlier to a brother of Séamas Quaid and he and his family are extremely distressed. They have been in contact with families of other gardaí who have died and they feel similarly. It is important to put on record the implications and the outcome of the decision made at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we should seriously examine and support what Deputy Flanagan proposes in ensuring that the nature and the seriousness of the offence is taken into consideration.  No offence is more serious than the taking of human life, especially the lives of gardaí who died on <Col N="1245" /> duty.  Séamas Quaid was off duty when he died but as with many other professions, once a garda, always a garda.  He responded to a situation and lost his life in the defence of the right of society to order.  The likely impact of the release of prisoners into the community will be significant in this case.  It is important in that the effect on a community of somebody who is seen not to have served a full sentence and paid his duty to society is profound.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiments of my colleagues from Limerick West and other Deputies regarding a person or persons convicted of capital murder in this State, I draw the attention of Members to the situation in the North.  A total of 299 members of the RUC lost their lives over the past 30 years and we, in this jurisdiction, do not appreciate the level of trauma and hardship for many families of these victims arising from these premeditated murders.  It is only when we hear the sentiments expressed by Deputies Finucane and Neville relating to a member of the Garda that we begin to appreciate the fact that 299 members of the RUC lost their lives and I regret that we have not appreciated that to such an extent as we might.  There is nothing in the amendment that would cause the Minister difficulty in terms of contravening or interfering with the Agreement and I hope he accepts the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this extremely sensitive and difficult matter.  I have the same difficulties in a general sense with the amendment tabled by Deputy Flanagan as I had with that tabled by Deputy Joe Higgins earlier.  As I explained, the general approach of the Bill is to require regard to be had to the relevant part of the Agreement in considering particular cases for release.  The Agreement specifically provides that the review process will allow account to be taken &ldquo;of the seriousness of the offence for which the person was convicted and the need to protect the community&rdquo;. That is set out in the Schedule to the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those factors fully reflect the issues mentioned in the amendment, but, for reasons I outlined earlier, it is more sensible to stick with the wording of the relevant part of the Agreement contained in the Schedule.  In those circumstances I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  In introducing this legislation, I am giving effect to that portion of the Agreement which relates to prisoners.  In doing that I am giving effect to the wishes of all parties, Members and the overwhelming majority of the people, North and South.  I sympathise with the situation in which the families of victims and the victims find themselves. I had meetings with the families of gardaí who lost their lives.  There was nothing I could say that would in any way ameliorate the sense of hurt and grief which they felt.  The unfortunate human dilemma, with which we are all faced here, <Col N="1246" /> is that it is of fundamental importance that future generations of Irish men and women should not be subjected to the nightmares of the past and that Ireland would grasp the opportunity which presented itself.  In that context difficult decisions had to be taken &mdash; decisions which have a farreaching effect and which reach into the human condition.</P>
    <P>Many people on this island are being asked to pay a far higher price than others for this peace. Unfortunately I have to ask them to pay that price and obviously it gives me no great pleasure. We had to try to prevent further death and destruction in our society and we had to ensure we would not replace a segment of a generation which was bereaved with a new segment of a future generation, and generations, which would also be bereaved.</P>
    <P>We are trying to ensure future generations, including this generation, will not be imprisoned by the past, confined by history and dictated to by what had gone on before.  In those circumstances difficult decisions had to be &mdash; and were &mdash; taken. The sympathies of all the people of this island go out to those families of victims and victims of violence.</P>
    <P>I have in the past gone on the record in relation to the case of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe.  I do not believe it would serve any useful purpose to repeat what I said then other than what I said then stands.  I have also gone on the record in relation to the position of people convicted of capital murder.  I do not believe it would serve any useful purpose to repeat what I said in relation to those matters.  Ireland owes a great debt of gratitude to the Garda Síochána who died in duty and who served the State so well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As with previous amendments in my name, I am reluctant to divide the House on the issue.  The Minister's reasons, as put forward, seem to indicate he is prepared to leave it to the text of the Agreement which states: &ldquo;The review process would provide for the advance of the release dates of qualifying prisoners while allowing account to be taken of the seriousness of the offences for which the person was convicted and the need to protect the community.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This deals in some form with paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amendment.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that paragraph (c) &mdash; the behaviour and characteristics of the qualifying prisoner &mdash; will be taken into consideration in the context of any formula used by him to determine whether a person is a qualifying prisoner within the meaning of the Act?  Will he agree there is no great difference between subsection (2) (a) &mdash; the nature and seriousness of the offence &mdash; and (b) &mdash; the likely impact of the release on the community &mdash; and that that would appear to be incorporated in the text of the Agreement?  If the Minister is prepared to give a commitment to consider paragraph (c) I will not divide the House.</P>

      <P>The text of the Agreement <Col N="1247" /> as set out in the Schedule to the Bill is clear.  I have outlined my view previously.  The text of the Agreement encompasses the amendments tabled by Deputy Flanagan.  There is a difference between deciding who is a qualified prisoner and the whole question of release.  These are two separate and distinct questions.  Earlier there was the whole question of what kind of conditions would be imposed and if conditions could be imposed. In deference to the exercise of the statutory power conferred on me by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, and on the Government, pursuant to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, all cases and the circumstances surrounding them, will be considered pursuant to those two Acts.</P>

I outlined also in what circumstances the 1939 Act could not apply.  I cannot go further than that.  I am satisfied from my reading of the Agreement and the text in the Schedule that the factors which Deputy Flanagan put forward in his amendments are already addressed in the Agreement.  In the circumstances I hope he will see his way to withdrawing his amendment and I trust I have allayed his concerns in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I move amendment No. 3a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall put in place appropriate procedures to ensure that a firearm in respect of which he has issued a certificate or licence to a person ordinarily resident outside the State is inspected against the details on the certificate or licence which has issued in respect of the said firearm, on the arrival of the licence at any port, airport or point of entry in the State and the same procedure shall apply on the licencee's departure at any port, airport or point of exit in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Stagg, we found three subsections of section 1 quite acceptable.  You said, a Cheann Comhairle, that we could achieve the same result by opposing certain provisions but we could only do that if we were allowed to oppose individual subsections rather than the section <i>in toto.</i>  We would like to support certain subsections because they meet some of what we seek to achieve, so in voting against the section we would strike down provisions we want to retain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment endeavours to ensure that the laxity which has applied up to now as regards bringing arms into the country will no longer prevail, so that as and from the enactment of this legislation there will be stringent regulations concerning the bringing of firearms into the State by people who are not ordinarily resident here.  Until now a person coming to Ireland for a shooting holiday could enter and leave the jurisdiction <Col N="1249" /> through any port or airport without being subject to a check as to whether he or she brought in a firearm.  There was also no check as to whether the firearm conformed to the licence or permit granted.  There was a major hullabaloo a few years ago about rod licences but here we are not talking about fishing rods but lethal weapons. There has been such laxity and non-implementation of rules in this area that it borders on criminal carelessness.  This amendment provides for a cross-check at the point of entry between the document authorising a person to bring a firearm into this jurisdiction and the gun itself, to see whether the two conform.  Of equal importance, there will be a similar check when the person leaves the jurisdiction to ensure first, that the weapon also leaves the jurisdiction, and second, that the weapon leaving is the one which was licensed to be brought in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment for the reasons stated.  It is self-evident that there should be a requirement that the weapons are checked against the licence at the point of entry.  I do not blame the Minister for the old regime because he inherited it but I am not satisfied with his reaction to it.  Under the previous regulations a person coming from abroad received a licence for one year from the day he received it.  That effectively gave him a licence over two licensing periods because it did not have to be renewed in July, as a licence held by an Irish person must be.  This meant the person could bring his gun into Ireland, leave it here, return at any time during the year and be licensed to use it.  I appreciate that the Bill gives the Minister power to do something about this but the provision is unclear &mdash; it says the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make inquiries, and it would be more satisfactory if it were specified what the inquiries might be and whether they will concern the entry of the gun and the method of ensuring the gun leaves the country when the person does.  Perhaps the Minister is happy to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the other speakers. This is a reasonable proposal and in view of the considerable public concern and unease about the Bill, the Minister should at a minimum accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that Opposition amendments have been ruled out of order even though they do not involve a financial charge.  As Opposition Members we have a right to put down amendments as we consider appropriate and those amendments should be allowed to be debated in the House, as far as that is practicable &mdash; I do not insist that the Minister should always accept them but I insist on my right, as a Member of this House, to be heard.  It is neither fair nor of value to rule out amendments in this way and to refuse to allow them to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment outlines certain safeguard and procedures which the Minister should accept.  As he said earlier, this is an emergency Bill dealing <Col N="1250" /> with an issue which is difficult and could even be dangerous if not handled properly, but it has not been given enough thought.  The additional safeguards proposed in the amendment can only be of assistance in tracking firearms brought into this country.</P>
    <P>We live in a more dangerous world than 25 or 30 years ago, although when the Firearms Act was introduced in 1925, it was a time of instability. In that regard the provisions of the Bill were difficult to get right, although it was achieved.  Our difficulty is that those provisions have not been enforced fairly across the board. This amendment provides a possibility to ensure that firearms which are brought in from outside are subject to safeguards and that the public are given the protection to which they are entitled. Under this Bill, Irish citizens will be subject to far more stringent regulation than overseas visitors. This position is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with one aspect of containing risks as regards people who are not known in this country and who come from jurisdictions with very different attitudes towards the ownership of guns.  The amendment is the minimum we should consider.  It is well thought out and must be included in the Bill if it is to have any credibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I also put down this amendment with my Opposition colleagues.  There is no control on people arriving and leaving the country with a firearm.  They are not being checked going out to ensure that they bring the firearm out of the country.  It is a back door method of importing guns.</P>
      <P>I will give the Minister an example of what happened in County Kerry.  Two individuals came over from England with two pellet guns.  They went shooting in County Kerry, missed the train back and had to rush for a subsequent train to get to the airport.  They left one of the pellet guns behind and did not think any more of it until five years later when the gardaí approached the uncle of one of the individuals with whom they had stayed.  He was asked for a licence for the gun and he told them it was not his but belonged to his nephew.  The gardaí eventually contacted the nephew and clarified this.</P>
      <P>It is ludicrous that someone can bring a gun into the State, yet there is no check to ensure it is brought out.  I am sure there are numerous examples of the same occurrence.  There is no control.  This amendment is necessary if the Bill is to be passed.  This Bill is a liberalisation of the law and should not be passed.  However, if the Minister is intent on pushing the Bill through, this amendment must be made.  Either the controls are not there or they are not being enforced.  This has been a problem for numerous Ministers and is not recent.  Now that we are introducing a Bill which deals with visitors, this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that there is more control over visitors.  Many of them do not give a damn what <Col N="1251" /> they shoot &mdash; protected species or not.  The Minister must regulate guides who show people around.  They should be prosecuted if a tourist shoots a protected species or breaks the law. People are exporting swans or shooting pheasants at the side of the road.  This is not right and should not happen.  They have no regard for Irish wildlife.  There is no game or wildlife in some countries.  In Italy, posses are out looking for rabbits to shoot because they have annihilated everything in their path.</P>
    <P>The same will happen here if we do not have proper controls in place.  Sadly this Bill will only encourage more of these people to come to this country and blatantly slaughter our wildlife.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Naughten raised an aspect of this Bill about which I am extremely concerned. I wish to encourage visitors and sportsmen to come here to enjoy themselves.  However, we must be careful about the type of sportsmen we encourage.  Deputy Naughten outlined some of the activities in which these people are involved and scenes from the wild west are nothing compared to what some people have witnessed. Drinking parties leave guns lying around late at night and early morning in woodland and on river banks.</P>
      <P>I am aware of parties of ten or 15 visitors, two of whom may carry gun licences, who share guns. There is no control over or restriction of this. Anyone applying for a gun licence here must have the signatures of a garda and a landowner who gives them a right to shoot on his or her land only.  However, visitors can fax their application for a gun licence.  They are not vetted and there is no background knowledge of their experience with guns.</P>
      <P>In my county, we had a tremendous problem with continental fishermen who cleaned our lakes of stock.  The best sportspeople in that regard were English fishermen who had a high regard for fishing rights.  All fish, apart from prize fish, were returned to the lakes.  The continental visitors brought fridge freezers and blackmailed guest houses into giving them freezer space.</P>
      <P>These are not the type of people we want.  They will kill our stocks of wildlife and leave nothing for anyone to enjoy.  A short-term gain will have long-term consequences.  A fishing rod is a harm-less implement but a gun is lethal.  We must be careful.  People will spread the message that they had a great time here with wild parties and late night shooting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to encourage all aspects of tourism, including shooting in a controlled manner. However, we must ensure there is strict legislation so that if visitors commit a misdemeanour they can be traced easily to pay damages or whatever. In one case, a farmer found one of his cows dead and no one was accountable.  I understand where the Minister is coming from but I ask him <Col N="1252" /> to think twice.  Rushed legislation is never good legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  It is important to control the level of firearms because the availability of the means of committing suicide is a factor in its level.  It is well researched, especially in the United States, that the availability of firearms can have an effect on the level of suicides by shooting.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the strictest regulations are made to ensure the control of firearms.  In doing so, we must recognise our major suicide problem.  Last year the rate increased by 14 per cent, to 433, more than one person per day.  We must introduce a suicide prevention programme and controlling the means of suicide should form part of that.  Control of firearms is one way to control the means of suicide.  In the United States one of the main ways males commit suicide is by the use of firearms, because of their availability.  Strict guidelines on the maintenance and use of firearms when granting a licence would play a small part in reducing the suicide rate.</P>

The principle and focus of the Bill is deliberately narrow in that it is concerned with the limitations and restrictions that apply to the consideration of an application for a firearm certificate.  It is also a temporary measure which is intended to expire within 12 months.</P>
      <P>The essence of the Deputy's proposal is more permanent and is, therefore, not suitable for an emergency interim measure such as this. Although I see some sense in the substance of the proposal, it is a substantive proposal that would require consideration by the review group.  The full implementation of the procedure suggested by the Deputy would require the imposition of entry and exit checks for firearms brought in and out of the country by tourist shooters at all ports and airports.  That would involve considerable administrative and resource difficulties.</P>
      <P>It must also be noted that such persons would have been the subject of consideration when their firearm certificate applications were being processed. At the same time, the idea of spot checks has some merit, but I would want the expert review group to give it full consideration.  I would particularly want the Garda authorities, who would have to implement such procedures, to examine the proposal.  There are implications for them in terms of manpower and so on.  I am not convinced it would be necessary or appropriate to establish a statutory basis for the implementation of such procedures, particularly in a temporary measure such as this Bill.  Even if they are considered worthwhile, following their full consideration, an administrative basis for their implementation could be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been suggestions to the effect that we are liberalising the law.  At times I wondered whether contributors were being deliberately mischievous or whether they simply did not read the <Col N="1253" /> legislation as presented to the House.  I again stress that the Bill does not liberalise the law. Non-resident shooters will be subject to any checks considered necessary to ascertain the application is bona fide and there is no good reason not to grant the firearm certificate.  The measures in section 2(5) and (6) considerably strengthen existing controls on tourist shooters. The Minister may revoke a certificate if he or she has reason to believe the holder presents a danger to the public safety and to the peace.  This power was not clearly defined in the Firearms Act, 1925. The Minister may also attach conditions to a certificate. The Bill, therefore, augments existing controls on firearms.  I disabuse Members of the notion that the legislation lacks credibility or that it will liberalise the law.  That is not true.</P>

      <P>The procedures, which Deputy Stagg described as nonsense, have been operated under various Governments, including one of which he was a member, for many years. This legislation is an interim response to a serious matter which has placed the future of a very significant sector of the tourist industry in some doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the review group has made its recommendations, substantive legislative and administrative changes will follow.  Safety and security considerations are uppermost in the provisions of the Bill and in the substantive changes that will inevitably follow the review group's consideration <Col N="1254" /> of the matter.  The group will take on board the views of those with an interest in this important subject.  It is my intention that it will conduct a root and branch review of all aspects of our firearms legislation.  It will consider the broad implications of the court judgment on the legislation and the procedures for the granting of firearm certificates to residents and non-residents alike. It will consult a wide range of interested parties, including the National Association of Regional Game Councils as well as tourist, wildlife and conservation interests.  The group will receive and consider submissions dealing with the legislative and administrative changes required in the areas of wildlife shooting and firearms regulation generally. Naturally it will give careful consideration to the safety and security implications of any proposed changes in this very sensitive area.  The conclusions and recommendations of the review group will not be allowed to gather dust, they will form the basis of the legislation that will follow. That is a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>With regard to the concerns of Members about checks on foreigners, a European firearms pass will be required from all applicants from the member states of the EU that issued the document. This pass is issued by the authorities to persons who are legally in possession of firearms and who wish to travel with them to other EU states. The pass contains information on the holder's identity and all firearms held by him or her.</P>

      <P>If the application is successful, the pass is amended to show the date during which the holder may enter the State and specifying the firearms he or she may bring.  Residents of other states will be required to provide sufficient documentation to show they satisfy the requirements of the Act.  Due to the differences in firearms legislation between various states, this documentation can take a variety of forms.  Firearm permits and hunting licences will be sought if they are issued by the applicant's home country.  The Bill entitles both me and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to make any inquiries considered appropriate to the term and suitability of an applicant.</P>

      <P>The legislation being put forward in the House does not liberalise the law on firearms which, incidentally, are among the most restrictive in Europe.  There are very good reasons for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Neville referred to the possibility of firearms being used in tragic cases of suicide and this matter was also raised by his Party Leader on the Order of Business last week.  The question is whether an opportunity will be taken to see if any improvements could be made through this Bill in the context of the alarming and disturbing growth in the level of suicide.</P>
      <P>The principle of the Bill is deliberately narrow in its focus.  It is confined to the limitations and restrictions for granting firearm certificates and hunting licences to non nationals visiting as tourists. The Deputy will be interested to know that the report of the national task force on suicide, which was launched earlier in the year by my colleague, the Minister Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, called for the relevant authorities to produce and make available for distribution a code of practice for the safe storage and disposal of firearms.  While such a code of practice has been produced by the Garda authorities for distribution to Irish shooters, and is in the course of being revised and updated, no similar code is distributed to shooter tourists.  In light of this, I have asked my officials to produce a similar code in consultation with the Garda authorities for distribution to visitors as soon as the reissuing of firearms certificates commences.</P>
      <P>That is as far and as well as I can put it.  Suggestions to the effect that the law on firearms and the issuing of certificates and hunting licences are being liberalised are wide of the mark.</P>

I am extremely surprised that he has allowed himself to be stampeded into this by his colleague, Bord Fáilte and vested interest groups.  The figure of £21 million is spurious.  As Deputy Stagg said in his contribution, one only has to do simple maths to see that the figures do not add up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Absolutely.  There is an inconsistency in the figures.  Just over ten days ago, the first press statement put out jointly by the Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, had two contradictions within it.  One, from the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said 4,000 people, while the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands <Col N="1256" /> referred to 3,000.  That was repeated today so, obviously, there was no co-ordination.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of someone who vaunted himself in Opposition as being the Minister for zero tolerance, it is appalling to bring about a fundamental relaxation in gun laws, of all things, which will allow a dilution of laws that have stood us in good stead.  The Minister will be singularly culpable if anything disastrous happens, as could well occur in the kind of global village the world has become.</P>
      <P>It is there in black and white.  The Minister is saying that notwithstanding anything in sections 4 or 8 of the Firearms Act, 1925, he will dilute the legislation that has stood us in good stead. Section 4 of the Firearms Act, 1925, states:</P>
      <P>Before granting a firearm certificate to any person under this Act the superintendent of the Garda Síochána or the Minister (as the case may require) shall be satisfied that such person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) has a good reason for requiring the firearm in respect of which the certificate is applied for, and</P>
      <P>(b) can be permitted to have in his possession, use, and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace, and</P>
      <P>(c) is not a person declared by this Act to be disentitled to hold a firearm certificate.</P>
      <P>Section 8 of the Act sets down the categories of people who would be disentitled, including any person under the age of 15, of intemperate habits, of unsound mind, who has a criminal conviction, who is subject to the supervision of the police, or is bound to keep the peace.</P>
      <P>The Minister is effectively watering this down. One only has to look at the wording in section 1(1) of the Bill:</P>
      <P>the Minister, before granting a firearm certificate to a person not ordinarily resident in the State, shall be of the opinion that the application is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate.</P>
      <P>How will he form the opinion on whether the application is bona fide?</P>
      <P>If I come into the country from Brussels and apply for a firearm certificate for five days shooting rights in County Mayo, what check will be carried out on me in this jurisdiction by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925? What consultation was there with the Garda Síochána?  Was there any meeting with the Garda Commissioner as to whether the Garda authorities are satisfied with this relaxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has vaunted the European pass as one of the qualifications for getting a certificate. Has he read the judgment of Mr. Justice Quirke when he spoke about such passes in the most disparaging terms?  Such a pass is obtainable on request by citizens of many European states <Col N="1257" /> which have not even enacted firearms legislation and where hunting licences are readily available without any investigation.</P>
    <P>This is the documentation the Minister is talking about as allowing somebody to come here and qualify under our existing stringent legislation. Section 1 is a dilution of the existing law &mdash; a watery, imprecise requirement which is both ineffectual and a nonsense.  It is a fig leaf to provide 3,000 or 4,000 people with firearms certificates and save the tourist season that is under threat because the Minister will not set out a simple questionnaire that we sought as a means of establishing whether somebody is qualified to hold such a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 1(3)(b) states:</P>
    <P>In any case, any other permit, licence, authorisation or other document duly issued by an appropriate authority or body outside the State which the Minister considers acceptable.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister not inserted the words, &ldquo;any other document authorising the carrying of a firearm&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Any other document&rdquo; could be a television licence, a dog licence or a dipping certificate. I have never come across more rushed, ineffective and careless legislation than this.  It should state in clear and unequivocal terms &ldquo;any other document authorising the carrying of a firearm&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said that this would be open to a constitutional challenge and it is.  We are enacting legislation which sets down so-called specific requirements for non-residents.  It could be a non-resident Irish person.  An Irish person working in Brussels could decide to come to this jurisdiction and avail of the new lax regime the Minister is introducing.  However, the same person's brother who is domiciled in this jurisdiction would have to be rigidly bound by the provisions of the Firearms Act, 1925.  The Minister is introducing two different regimes, not alone between European and Irish citizens but between Irish citizens living in this jurisdiction and those living abroad.  The Minister can rest assured this will be challenged and it will be struck down.  What Deputies Stagg, McManus, Naughten and I have said will be fully vindicated.  The Minister is going down the wrong road in this regard.  It is a foolish, careless and dangerous road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has rejected this reasonable amendment, particularly when our other amendments were ruled out of order.  He indicated his belief that it is reasonable but he said it is not required because this is emergency legislation and the matter will be considered in the substantial Bill.  However, this is not a temporary measure.  The Bill has an automatic life of one year and the Minister may extend it for another year, which is a long time. Many people could get into this country with guns in that period and use them to destroy wildlife in the way described on Second Stage.  I would like strong restrictions so that we could vet and corral <Col N="1258" /> these people when they come into this country to stop that happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister keeps repeating <i>ad nauseam</i> that he is not liberalising the law when he is.  He is deliberately reducing the qualifications for people who do not live in Ireland to get a gun licence.  If he is not doing that, he does not need to do anything because the rules for getting a gun licence are in the Firearms Act and they are clear and onerous, as described by the judge.  The Minister is removing these strong safety measures and accepting in their stead a pass from an authority.</P>
      <P>I take the example of a US citizen who can buy anything from a machine gun to a hand gun by walking into a shop.  He will automatically get licences for up to 30 weapons at a time.  In most states his criminal record is not required to be checked, yet he has a pass.  He can come here, present his pass and get a licence to bring guns into the country.  I know one American who came here and brought in 24 guns.  I am sure the Department is aware of him as well.</P>
      <P>The Minister is deliberately differentiating between the tough regime which exists for issuing licences to Irish citizens and the softer regime for people from other countries.  I know he is not confused because he is intelligent and clever and a capable lawyer and he is not confusing me. However, he is trying to confuse the House by saying he will now have a regime for issuing licences where previously no regime existed.  The law was ignored by people with whom I and the Minister were in Government and Governments the Minister supported when he was not in office and anyone who applied for a licence got it.  That was in breach of the law and the High Court has established that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact the Minister is putting a régime in place because that is an improvement. However, in doing so, he is diluting the law so that it will be legal for people from Italy who shoot songbirds and people from France who shoot protected species, both the fur and feathered variety, on a regular basis to get licences. That differentiation in our law will be seen by the courts to be unfair, unbalanced and probably unconstitutional.  I will support the organisation to which my local game club is affiliated, NARGC, if it takes the Minister to court on this law and I urge it to do so.  The Minister will use his majority in the House to bludgeon this measure through.  I will speak later about other provisions in section 1 which are not directly related to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that even if this amendment was passed, he would not have the resources to police the holding of guns.  We cannot afford not to have the resources to do that.  We must provide the resources to the gardaí to ensure that they can do proper checks on guns held in this country. The Minister is encouraging people to flout the law by saying he would not have the resources to do the checks which this amendment would require.  Resources will be available to record and check guns held by our citizens, but a handful of <Col N="1259" /> people &mdash; 4,000 a year if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is right and 3,000 a year if the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is right &mdash; will be entitled to bring guns into this country and sell them illegally. Most of the other things they do are illegal as well but there is no sanction against them.  The Minister has not dealt with the fact that these people have breached the Wildlife Act.  Sanctions have not been imposed on them because they do not live in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There will now be two forms of gun registration, of which one will not require records to be kept.  The gun will be allowed into the country without being checked at the point of entry and there will not be checks to ensure it is taken out again.  I am sure a trade will develop in illegal Italian, French and German guns.  It is unlikely a trade will develop in British guns because they are so expensive.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine his attitude to this two year Bill.  My experience is that if it is possible to let a Bill run for two years because of the pressure on the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for space for other Bills, it will be allowed to run for two years and an order will be made for the second year.  I ask the Minister to examine the consequences of doing so and to stop telling us he is not diluting the law.  It is patently obvious that the purpose of this Bill is to dilute the law so that the Minister can give licences to foreigners to come to Ireland. If that is not the case, why is he not diluting the law or making the same rules for Irish citizens? The list of people who are exempted from getting gun licences will not be included in the new regulations because the Minister says he has no way of checking it.  He is diluting the law and introducing a two way system, one for Irish citizens and one for non-resident people who wish to come here.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister will not accept this important amendment.  Without it, the Bill would be more aptly called the cowboy liberalisation Bill because it encourages people to come here and flout the law.  We have no control at the point of entry, while these people are in this country or on when they leave it.  They can bring in whatever guns they wish and shoot whatever they like while they are here and then leave it behind or sell it before they go.  We are talking about approximately 15,000 to 16,000 guns which will not be regulated and will be freely available.  The 4,000 people who come here every year each bring three or four guns with them.  No one has any control over whether they leave the State.</P>
      <P>Gardaí can guarantee the credentials of a resident but there are no controls on anyone coming into the country because they are not checked in this State or in the vast majority of EU member states.  There are four EU member states in which there are no licensing requirements for firearms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> The Bill will give foreigners similar liberties here. Non-nationals can get a gun licence abroad without requiring any credentials and bring them in here and use them freely.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the restrictions in the Bill, but it will encourage an abuse of the law as stated by the other speakers.  The Minister has been forced into this position by his ministerial colleague.  In Opposition the Minister spoke of the need to be strong on crime, for which I commend him, but he has failed in that regard since he came into office.  He is liberalising the legislation on firearms in this country for non-nationals. They can bring in more than 500 rounds of ammunition, yet a national can only hold up to 50 rounds of ammunition.  Instead of liberalising the law, we should restrict it for foreigners because there are fewer controls in other EU member states.  We should make the law more restrictive by ensuring guides are licensed.  They should be liable to prosecution in the same way as the individual involved if they are caught doing anything illegal, whether shooting a protected species or whatever.  There is mass slaughter of wildlife here.  Licensing guides would bring in revenue which could be used to protect wild fowl and ensure there would be a greater number of them in future.</P>
    <P>As a result of this legislation and the lack of resources being put into gun clubs, in a few years time we will end up like Italy, with ten out of 12 people running after one rabbit.  All the wildlife in Italy has been shot.  That will happen here if the Minister does not restrict the current practice. I am disappointed he will not accept this amendment. He agrees with it in principle and he should reconsider it between now and Report Stage and accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am disappointed the Minister has refused to accept this amendment.  I am also disappointed with the line he has tried to sell us, that he is not liberalising the law.  I expected more of him.  I would have preferred if he had been honest and said it is expedient that he creates a two tier system and that Irish people will be at a disadvantage compared to overseas visitors.  That would have been a more honest approach, but he has consistently denied the fact that he is weakening the current law and, in effect, liberalising it for overseas visitors, who will be treated differently from Irish citizens under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who follow this debate will find it hard to stomach that the Minister, who made his reputation on calling for zero tolerance, saying he would ensure the law is always held in high regard and that there should be compliance with the law on a mass scale, is putting himself in a position where he is likely to be back in court and again found in the wrong.  I would have thought once is enough.  The judgment of 12 June related to a range of subjects and, on the specific question of the assessment carried out in respect of overseas visitors bringing in firearms, it states that <Col N="1261" /> the procedures adopted by the Minister and his Department are not in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>If zero tolerance means anything, it means ensuring everybody is the same before the law. We cannot have a system upheld in our courts whereby people who live abroad, Irish or not, can easily get access to a firearm and bring it in here to use for sport or recreation.  That is an untenable situation for any Minister, but particularly for one who places such virtue on the principle of the fundamental importance of the law.  He is changing the law to make it more liberal for particular individuals who live overseas and no one can say otherwise.  He may say he is not doing that, but it is clear he is; if he was not we would not be having this debate and there would not be a Bill under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was unable to accept this amendment because of a lack of resources.  I put it to him that under section 1(4) which states &ldquo;The Minister may make such inquiries as he or she considers appropriate as to the suitability of any applicant&rdquo; he is putting all the responsibility on the Department to do the donkey work, that of making the necessary inquiries to determine whether somebody is suitable.  Why should the applicant not provide the necessary information and the evidence required by the Department before a licence is granted?  Under the approach adopted in the Bill the Department will have to carry out the necessary checks and balances to trace the information required.  Who will it approach?  I presume it will contact the police in other countries, the police who the Minister said were unable to give satisfactory guarantees in respect of people coming here.  How will that system work?  It will create problems for the Department and the Minister will have to depend on the source of information which he said could not provide satisfactory guarantees.  The responsibility in this regard must lie with the applicant. Nobody is forcing anyone to come to Ireland. Strenuous efforts are being made in the Department to stop people coming here.  If they come here fleeing from persecution, they are refused the right to work, to dignity and to independence, but those who come here with money in their pockets are given immunity.  They can bring weapons in here that can kill humans as well as bird life, but the checks and balances we expect as of right and that apply to our citizens, who are no more venal than people in any other European country or elsewhere, do not apply to visitors from other countries.</P>
    <P>We are nearing the point where we have lost the run of ourselves in respect of tourism.  We must establish fundamental protections that apply in any area of tourism.  I cannot think of any area more fundamental than this because it relates to weapons that can kill.  I pay tribute to the Fine Gael Deputies who are primarily responsible for this amendment.  Deputy Stagg also played a part in drawing up this carefully phrased amendment. If accepted, it would send out an important signal that we will not provide a haven or wide open <Col N="1262" /> spaces where people can misbehave as they choose and not act in accordance with the best standards and practice in relation to wildlife, that we will set down the parameters for conduct and put in place the necessary controls to ensure those are adhered to.</P>
    <P>In Opposition the Minister made many speeches to the effect that zero tolerance is about ensuring that the law is upheld in respect of aspects of law breaking, which individually do not constitute major criminal acts, to ensure there will be less major crime as a result of a general standard of good behaviour.  In this instance, the Minister is enabling bad behaviour.  He is providing for it in ensuring that overseas visitors do not have to prove anything, as far as I can see, except that they can apply for a licence.  Where there is a difficulty the onus will be on the Department to ferret out the details and chase the police in Belgium, the US or wherever to find out about the person.  At what stage will that be done?  Will it be when it is too late?  People were shocked by the laxity which pervaded the Department which was evident in the judgment.</P>
    <P>I give no excuses for any Government because it is clear it is not a practice which lies solely at this Minister's door.  We all recognise that and we do not need to be told.  However, it is the Minister's responsibility to deal with it now and not have to face a judge at some future time to argue that it is right to treat Irish citizens who live here differently and to discriminate against them as in this Bill.  Will the Minister reconsider this amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister, who is a reasonable man who takes his position extremely seriously, to listen to what is being said with sincerity on this side of the House.  I believe he is acting under pressure from Bord Fáilte.  Bord Fáilte is reckless in its claims about the benefit to this country of this type of tourism.  I will not decry Bord Fáilte because it has done an excellent job in promoting Irish tourism worldwide, but it sometimes gets it wrong.  It is getting it seriously wrong here in attracting coarse fishermen from the Continent, to which I referred in my last contribution, to the extent that the coarse stocks were nearly wiped out in the general area of my constituency, the catchment area of the Erne waterways.  The stocks were practically wiped out by irresponsible continental fishermen arriving with fridge-freezers, cleaning out the stocks of eel and perch, and bringing them home and making a profit on their holidays.  Legislation had to be introduced to curtail this activity.  The Minister is now introducing legislation to make it a free for all, to do in the game shooting area exactly what was done in the coarse fishing area. The stocks will be wiped out.</P>
      <P>The Minister should place an embargo on new licences for visitors for 12 months or two years. Genuine people are concerned with protecting wildlife and increasing the stocks of wildlife will breathe a sigh of relief and nothing will be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> However, everything will be lost if the Minister rushes this Bill through the House tonight.  He will make it easy for people, of whose background we have little knowledge, to come to Ireland, get guns and shoot willy-nilly at anything which comes in their path.</P>
    <P>The dangers of this practice has been well debated.  I accept what Deputy Stagg stated, that the Minister intends to review it in 12 months but that it will drift to two years.  The Minister will be aware that, with the amount of legislation from his Department which is backed up waiting to be introduced to this House, that review could be in three or four years.  When the Minister gets around to it, all will be lost.</P>
    <P>I have met tourists who come here for the shooting season and they are responsible people. However, once the word gets out, as it did to the continental fishermen, it will be a different matter. The English fishermen are gentlemen and they always respect the fish stocks and ensure they play their part in maintaining those stocks. No doubt excellent sportsmen come here, but what if the message gets out that it is easy to get a gun licence in Ireland, that people should come over for a wild weekend party, drink plenty of booze and hand around the guns?  If a party of ten people comes here and two members have gun licences, can the Minister tell me who will use the guns?  Are people restricted from shooting during the hours of darkness?  I am aware of high-powered battery lamps being used to spotlight wildlife.  The danger to farm animals, farmers tending their stock or anybody walking around the countryside whenever the shooting takes place must be taken into account.  There are responsible people from foreign gun clubs who come here, but this Bill will open an avenue to the type of people we do not want.  Bord Fáilte will be negligent if it forces the Minister into this and encourages him to introduce legislation from which we will not gain any great reward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister reconsider the Bill, withdraw it and introduce it at a later stage when he has properly amended it?  This is the daftest Bill to be brought before this House.  I agree with all the previous speakers, every one of whom made valid points.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boylan spoke about Bord Fáilte and I am sure it is playing a major part in advocating this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>If Bord Fáilte is involved, it will probably count the guns and dead animals and use the numbers at the end of the year to say there were so many visitors to this country.  That is the way Bord Fáilte operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am totally opposed to this Bill.  When we see how violent society has become and what has happened in America in recent months, where young children of 12 and 13 brought guns into <Col N="1264" /> schools and shot their colleagues and teachers, we should tighten up the law rather than relax it.</P>
    <P>There cannot be a two-tier system.  There are too many of them already.  This Bill is dangerous. If visitors, about whom we know nothing, know it is easy to bring guns into this country, a business will be set up to sell on imported arms to people here.  The Minister must remember that there are enough criminals here who can get arms and murder people without people coming from other parts of the world giving them more powerful guns and weapons.  The Minister should accept the amendment tabled by many Deputies.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Boylan, I see visitors regularly because I come from a tourist town.  There are two things people hate about the tourist season. They hate to see American drivers.  I assure the Minister, between now and the end of the summer, two or three people will be killed in my constituency with these fellows driving on the wrong side of the road.  Such people are brought to court the following morning and fined and that is the last we hear of it.  The other people we hate to see arrive are those who, on a fine morning at 6 a.m. or late in the evening, get out of their cars to go into hotels in the west looking like US Army men with all their equipment and guns.  It is dangerous and off-putting and I am very worried about it.  For many years people have been complaining about the way these people hunt.  They shoot anything which moves or flies, be it a pigeon or whatever.  If the Minister put his head above ground they would take it off too.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled by reasonable people and was carefully thought out.  I ask the Minister to reconsider it.  I know he said he would look at it in two years but he and I know what will happen.  It will be addressed by ministerial order.  It will not be looked at again and this legislation will be in place for the next 20 years.</P>

    <P>Departmental officials are as concerned as any Member to ensure the risk to the community is minimised in so far as is humanly possible in making decisions about issuing licences and firearms <Col N="1267" /> certificates.  Any suggestion to the contrary is disingenuous and untrue.  In deciding whether a firearms certificate should be granted an individual is required to submit a firearms permit from the country of his or her residence, checks are carried out to ascertain if there have been convictions in this State, and an individual's age is checked.  The licence is confined to a category which is acceptable, that is, a shotgun or rifle.  If necessary, a reference can be asked for such as a police document stating that the individual has not been found guilty of a criminal offence in the country of his or her residence.</P>

      <P>Deputies asked what precisely is meant by the reference to any other document which the Minister might require.  This would allow a statement or reference to be sought from a reputable person. In other words, it would not be a permit or authorisation but could be acceptable to verify the bona fides of the applicant.  It could include a statement from the police or other authority. Deputy McManus suggested that the onus of proof should be placed on the applicant.  Police forces throughout the world may give confirmation that an applicant has no convictions but the experience of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicates that they will not guarantee that an applicant is of sound mind and temperate habits.  It is difficult to blame them for that because police forces do not have professional expertise in these areas.</P>

      <P>As a Dáil colleague of mine &mdash; he also lives in County Kerry &mdash; often says &ldquo;It makes no sense at all only nonsense&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our fellow Irishmen in Northern Ireland, who make regular visits to the Republic for shooting purposes, have not been able to obtain firearms certificates since 12 June 1998.  The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have refused to issue hunting licences and firearms certificates in the past.  Everyone who applies does not always obtain a firearms certificate.  Where applications for hunting licences are refused, it follows as a matter of course that firearms certificates cannot issue.  In addition, applications for firearms certificates have also been refused in their own right.</P>
      <P>The review group will consult widely with everyone interested in this important subject. This will lead, in turn, to comprehensive change in legislation dealing with firearms certificates and hunting licences in this country.  The review of the Wildlife Act, 1976, will lead to fundamental changes in the law relating to this area.  In short, the recent High Court judgment will be a catalyst for major change in these important areas.  I have sought to bring forward legislation to regularise the position &mdash; in so far as that can be done &mdash; while showing the greatest concern for public safety, the protection of wildlife and the protection of people's livelihoods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: It is important that this matter should be pressed to a vote.  The people must be made aware of the Minister's opposition <Col N="1270" /> to a sensible safety procedure in respect of checking the bona fides of foreign nationals, establishing the identity of the firearms in their possession and ensuring that such firearms conform with the certificates that have been granted, and likewise at the point of exit.</P>
      <P>What consultations were held with the Garda Síochána in respect of the legislation?  Was the Garda Commissioner consulted?  If a resident of The Hague applies for a firearms certificate to shoot in this country, can the Minister guarantee that thorough investigations will be made into their suitability to hold such a certificate under the seven qualifying subsections of the 1925 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that if the Minister was not changing or diluting the law he would not be doing anything at all.  The High Court decided that the 1924 Act, as amended by the 1964 Act, is perfectly good law.  We are diluting that law to allow foreigners to obtain licences to shoot in Ireland without the imposition of proper controls. I have sincere sympathy for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the departmental staff who will have to pick up the pieces when the hoards of foreign nationals have been encouraged to come to Ireland to shoot anything they can find.</P>
      <P>Section 1 is the essential section which provides &ldquo;no good reason&rdquo; as the basis for decision.  It is the essence of bad law.  There is not a worse reason for making a legal decision than that there is no good reason not to.  That theme runs through the Bill. Any action that the Minister should take is qualified to death, so to speak, so that if he does nothing he is in the clear.  An example is section 2(3) which provides that &ldquo;The Minister may make such enquiries as he or she considers appropriate as to the suitability of any applicant .&rdquo;. It is double qualified in case there is any chance of error.  It is as if the draftsman read it only once and the Bill was cleared with all possible qualifications to safeguard the Minister and the Department.</P>
      <P>What sanction will the Minister, the Department or the Garda have against a French person who is licensed to shoot if that person shoots songbirds?  Does the Minister agree that Irish citizens will demand that he concedes to them the same regulations as will apply to foreigners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to intervene at this point but having heard some of the hysteria from the Opposition I felt it important to do so.  As a Minister I had some responsibility in this area. Many people come to shoot in my constituency every season and a lot of the business is repeat business from professional people who have been shooting for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business to which I refer is run by a hotel which has its own lands for shooting, rears its own birds, organises the shoots and employs a fully professional shooting expert to organise the business. The company imports about 110,000 eggs <Col N="1271" /> each year from the US and it rears the birds which feed on about 14 to 15 tonnes of wheat a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of that.  We are not in favour of shooting blackbirds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>This concern rears birds for shooting, including partridges, pheasants and mallards, on its own lands in a controlled environment.  It is a lucrative business which is highly organised and specialised.  Deputy McManus will be aware that there is a similarly organised concern in County Wicklow.  The gun clubs which have been at loggerheads with some of the companies which rear the birds buy birds from them.  It is an established practice.</P>
      <P>It is a worthwhile business which employs many people.  The estate in County Clare imports eggs, rears birds, organises shoots and has a trained, professional guide in charge.  In the last 11 years there has not been an accident there. Those involved are very skilled and highly professional. There is no fear of mass suicide arising from this skilled operation.  There is no record of accidents or anything of that nature.</P>
      <P>There have been complaints about indiscriminate shooting and the cases of which I am aware involve only a small minority of shooters.  Nearly all have been at the behest of a local gillie or guide&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be unfair to send out a message that this business is irresponsible because it is not.  The regional game councils should settle their differences with the business operators because, in most cases, they depend on them for the supply of game for their shoots.  I cannot accept a situation in which a vested interest will try to damage this lucrative business.</P>

This amendment will ensure that if we do not supervise the import and export of firearms we can supervise them while they are here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Daly was talking about the exclusive, super-rich clubs attached to some of the more prosperous hotels with private grounds. There may be a similarity with the passports for sale mess which we are trying to tidy up.  These clubs should also be investigated because they have guns on the premises which are handed out to those with buckets of cash to spend.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is concerned about this issue but he is getting bad advice.  Bord Fáilte has done excellent work but it has been wrong in the past and it is getting it wrong now by promoting this aspect of tourism.  It needs to be handled very carefully, otherwise we will wipe out the industry we are trying to promote.</P>
      <P>If the word gets out that they can get a licence we will attract the wrong type of groups.  If one or two people get a licence and the guns are available they can be passed around the group, perhaps to people who have taken drink.  I am not referring to exclusive clubs but to groups of people.  We have seen it in other aspects of sport throughout the world.  We saw soccer hooliganism in which professional people were involved.  We should not be fooled, and we should be very careful. What power has the Minister to prevent other members of a party of ten or 12 people, two of whom have a licence to handle guns, availing of the use of those guns at all hours of the day or night?</P>

      <P>In this world one can only do one's best.  It is not possible to give absolute guarantees about what might happen in the course of a day, a week or a year.  The procedures in place will remain.  They are the same procedures as before, and they will continue to be operated with the additional two restrictions. Should there be a tragedy, it will not have been brought about by this legislation.</P>

    <P>The law is being changed in that the restrictions in the 1925 Act are being replaced by the provisions in this Bill.  The law is being changed <Col N="1273" /> because of the High Court action, but the procedures remain the same.  Some people here have decided, for reasons best known to themselves, that change means liberalisation, even if it is temporary.

      <P>If people feel there should be further restrictions, they should put those proposals on the table in the context of a review, then we can talk about doing something constructive.  This legislation, because of its fundamental importance to so many people, is not something with which Deputies should play politics.</P>

      <P>The Minister partly answered the question.  If a Frenchman shoots a blackbird, which is illegal, is it possible for the Garda Síochána to issue a summons and bring him to court?

That is why I said earlier it is possible that certain provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, may not have worked very well.  If it is Deputy Stagg's view that this legislation needs to be strengthened, he is free and able to put forward his view to the Minister with responsibility for the new Wildlife Bill which will be produced in the autumn.  It is also open to him to put forward any views he may hold &mdash; as other interested parties may &mdash; to the expert group which will review the issuance of firearms certificates and hunting licences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Any release under this Act shall be by way of licence revocable by the Minister and in the event of such powers of revocation being exercised, the prisoner shall be returned to custody without warrant or court proceedings.</P>
      <P>(3) A prisoner's licence under this section shall be subject to the following conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> (a) that he or she does not support a terrorist organisation,</P>
    <P>(b) that he or she does not become involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and</P>
    <P>(c) that he or she does not endanger the public.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Conscious that we did not have an opportunity to debate this matter in detail on Committee Stage, I hope the Minister can clarify certain matters. What are the consequences of the release, the type of release and the power, if any, the Minister may have to introduce sanctions or conditions that affect that release?  The Minister stated earlier the release procedure will be that practised under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, but was not in a position to say which would be employed in any given case.  It is important that a scheme is put in place that will allow for clear and unambiguous conditions to be attached.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a licence operation for release.  The Minister stated on Second Stage this was unknown in Irish law and because of that he would not accommodate it now.  Because it is unknown to Irish law does not mean it is inappropriate to Irish law or that it has nothing to offer Irish law.  Such a system would ensure the Minister could revoke the licence, thereby reinaugurating the sentence at some future time.  That future time would obviously be in a situation where terrorist activities would be undertaken by either the individual or the organisation to which he is affiliated.</P>
    <P>The amendment is reasonable, meets a public concern and acts as an important safeguard.  I do not wish to deal with it on a line by line basis as it is self-explanatory.  If the Minister is not in a position to accept it will he apply the conditions he can apply in the matter of an early release or temporary release or will it be a pardon or an amnesty?  I have asked this question on a number of occasions today and have not got a straight answer as to the type of release period and whether conditions will be attached.  Will it be contingent on a certain amount of good behaviour? Will there be provision for supervision by probation and welfare services?  Will there be a requirement that certain visits be made to a Garda station at any time?  What conditions, if any, does the Minister envisage building into the legislation or the methodology he will apply? Does he envisage co-operation with, for example, the decommissioning body and has he anything to say on a form of relationship with that body? To allow an unconditional release may give rise to difficulties in the future.  These are the safeguards which we, as legislators, have a duty not only to consider but to ensure.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.  If the Minister is not in a position to accept it &mdash; he indicated earlier he was not &mdash; I hope he can give certain assurances along the lines suggested as to <Col N="1280" /> the conditions he will apply as the releases take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue (Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform) Mr. O'Donoghue (Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue: (Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment provides that any releases under the Bill shall be by way of licence revocable by the Minister.  This is unnecessarily trying to follow the law in another jurisdiction.  We do not, as a matter of law, have release by way of licence.  That concept cannot simply be transplanted into our law in the way the amendment seeks without further legislative infrastructure to support it.  In any event we have a system of release parallel to the United Kingdom licence system, which is release subject to conditions.  Therefore, there is no need to try to import this concept.  While the concept of release on licence was a United Kingdom concept we have a release in this jurisdiction subject to conditions.  To that extent we have a parallel system of release.  It is important that this is said in case anybody should think our system is radically different.  It is different but parallel and conditions can be attached in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The conditions which should be attached to particular releases fall to be considered on a case by case basis.  In exercising existing release powers in the context of the Agreement, the standard condition to the effect that a person keeps the peace and be of good behaviour will apply.  It will be generally accepted that that condition encompasses what we wish to achieve and that there would be no advantage &mdash; there could be disadvantages &mdash; in seeking to define it more specifically.  A further basic difficulty with the amendment is that it refers to releases made under this Act when in fact releases would fall to be made under release powers in other legislation. For the reasons outlined I do not believe the amendment is appropriate or necessary.</P>
      <P>With regard to conditions generally, we already discussed the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  It would not be productive if I were to rake over those coals and I doubt Deputy Flanagan wishes me to do so.  As to making reference to the decommissioning body, I gather the British legislation as first presented states that the body should be satisfied that an individual has co-operated with it, but that is not provided in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I outlined to the House that releases under our legislation would be pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, under which the Minister has the power, and the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, under which the power rests with the Government.  It is not possible to give an accurate answer to the interesting questions raised by Deputy Flanagan because every case must be considered individually.  I indicated that the vast majority of releases would be pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, because we are talking about repatriated prisoners &mdash; the 1939 Act does not refer to such prisoners and does not encompass cases of capital murder, which leaves <Col N="1281" /> the minority of prisoners to be dealt with under either Act.  I assure the Deputy that each case will be carefully considered and dealt with by the Government or the Minister as the case may be, according to which Act applies in a given case.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are related and may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.  &mdash; The Minister shall provide a statement containing information for victims of interested parties, provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) he or she receives a written request for such statement, and</P>
      <P>(b) the provision of such statement does not create a danger to the safety of any person.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I expect everyone in the House would agree with the Minister's remarks on Second Stage about the importance of victims.  The Government must take a difficult decision and it will have a great impact on those victims.  This amendment will ensure they or their relatives will be aware of the circumstances of prisoner release.  It concerns a small number of people and, if accepted, will cause few if any problems.  Should a victim or a relative of a victim request from the Minister in writing the particulars of a release, such information should be furnished.  As Deputy De Rossa said, the manner of a release may impact on victims and we should ensure no greater hurt, trauma or anxiety is perpetrated or revisited on them.</P>
      <P>Doubtless many people will not make such a written request and if that is the case so be it.  The proposed section 5(b) contains a safeguard for the prisoner, which is important.  This is a reasonable, balanced provision and if the Minister will not accept it, perhaps he will indicate that he will consider it favourably in the context of the machinery he will put in place to consider each release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong case for accepting these amendments.  They would not create an administrative burden for the Minister's Department.  Not many prisoners will fall to be released under this scheme and some will be released through the normal remission period on their sentences in any event over the next two years.  It would demonstrate yet again a sensitivity to the feelings of the victims of those in prison, some of whom have been convicted for serious crimes against individuals, including murder of members of the Garda Síochána.  I can think of no worse scenario than being a victim of crime and meeting the perpetrator on the street, not having known that he had been released.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> There are people who will not want to know this but would rather put it behind them and forget about the circumstances.  That is why my amendment No. 3 provides that a written request must be received &mdash; in other words, not everyone related to or associated with a victim of a crime will automatically receive information about a prisoner's release, only if a written request is made by a victim or a victim's relative will the information be provided.</P>
    <P>The information involved would include whether the advice of the commission has been sought about a qualifying prisoner, because under this Act it is not necessary for the Minister to seek the commission's advice in all cases; it is optional but I am sure in most cases he will seek it.  Nonetheless, it is important that this information be available.  If the Minister has received such advice, a person inquiring should also be told whether the Minister intends to exercise a power of release &mdash; that is, if he intends to release a prisoner.  The proposed date of release and any terms and conditions attached to the release should also be made known, and details should also be given in the case of a person who has already been released.</P>
    <P>Of all those conditions or information which might be sought, the most important for the victims and their relatives would be the proposed date of release and the terms and conditions attaching thereto.  Earlier I asked the Minister whether he could apply a condition as to the area where a released prisoner might live &mdash; whether he had the power or intended to use the power to preclude a person from living near his victim or a relative of the victim.  Different criteria would apply in different parts of the country &mdash; for instance, it would be problematic if a released prisoner lived in the same small town as his victim, whereas it might or might not be as much of a problem if they lived in different parts of Dublin.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted by the Minister, those who are concerned about this matter will have an opportunity to convey that concern to him.</P>
    <P>We must further demonstrate our understanding of the trauma through which many will go as a result of this legislation and the Agreement.  I have argued since the acceptance of the Agreement that we cannot pick measures from it <i>a la carte</i> and say &ldquo;we like this and do not like that&rdquo; or &ldquo;we will implement this but not implement that&rdquo;.  It must be implemented in totality.  In doing so, this House must have regard to the victims of those we will release in the next two years.</P>
    <P>The Schedule quotes a section of the Agreement &mdash;&ldquo;. any qualifying prisoners who remained in custody two years after the commencement of the scheme would be released at that point&rdquo;.  What is the date for the commencement of the scheme?  Is it when this legislation is signed by the President or the date of the Agreement?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1283" /> I sympathise with the thinking behind these amendments.  I accept that, to the greatest extent possible, victims should be informed in relation to the release of prisoners.  However, for reasons I will explain, this matter should be addressed by appropriate administrative arrangements rather than by enshrining amendments of the kind proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an inherent difficulty in defining a victim of an offence.  This is clear in many cases, for example where a person has sustained a direct physical injury as a result of the commission of an offence.  Where a person is a victim in a wider or more remote sense, difficulties arise in assessing whether the amendment would confer on those people a right to certain information. The amendments make no attempt to define the term &ldquo;victim&rdquo;.  The terms &ldquo;a member of his or her family&rdquo; or &ldquo;interested party to&rdquo; are unlikely to be sufficiently legally precise.</P>
    <P>There is also the practical consideration that the majority of qualifying prisoners in this jurisdiction have been transferred from the United Kingdom and even if a satisfactory definition of victim was included in the amendment, there could be significant difficulties at this remove in establishing the bona fides of an applicant.</P>
    <P>There are also problems with some of the detail the Minister would be obliged to supply under amendment No. 3.  This would require the Minister to indicate whether he or she intends to exercise any power of release in regard to the qualifying prisoner.  The request could be made at a time when no decision had been made in the particular case so the Minister would not have the information which, under the amendment, he or she would be obliged to supply.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that in all cases it would be appropriate for a victim to be aware of all the conditions of a prisoner's release.  It could prove the case that a condition of release relates to the personal circumstances of an offender which would be relevant to the interests of a victim.  The amendment would require this to be revealed.  I am not suggesting that this would be the norm in releases, but we must plan for every eventuality.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is very vague and refers to the Minister providing a statement containing information for victims or interested parties but gives no indication of what is to be contained in the statement.  Because of the type of issues I have outlined, I have grave doubts about the wisdom of trying to deal with this matter on a statutory basis.  I can give a commitment we will put in place whatever administrative arrangements are appropriate to address the legitimate interests of victims in this area.</P>
    <P>The former Tánaiste, Mr. Wilson, may have specific recommendations to make in his examination of the needs of victims.  I am pleased that Members welcomed his appointment.  The situation is more complicated in the case of repatriated offenders where victims do not live in this jurisdiction.  I will be in contact with the Home <Col N="1284" /> Secretary in relation to the release of prisoners who have been transferred here from the United Kingdom.  In the light of our discussions I will raise with him the relevant issues <i>vis-a -vis</i> victims in that jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We all accept the need to address the needs and rights of victims.  For the reasons I have given, I do not believe this will be best done by legislative measures.  However, I assure Deputies it is the intention to address these matters as effectively and appropriately as possible on an administrative basis.</P>

      <P>As the summer has finally reached us, there will be increased use of our sea, lakes and beaches and safety must be a priority in all these areas.  A major source of concern is the indiscriminate use of jetskis.  They are known as &ldquo;personal watercraft&rdquo;&mdash; the essential accessory like a mobile phone or personal stereo.  However, a jetski is not a toy but a dangerous motorbike which can travel at speeds of over 50 mph on water.  Unfortunately, there are no restrictions or safety guidelines for their operation and these are urgently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would not put a ten year old on a motorbike on the streets.  Yet any person of any age with no experience, licence or insurance can drive <Col N="1285" /> a jet ski which is as powerful as a motorbike.  Due to the lack of regulations a jet ski was given away last week as a prize on a radio station.  Who knows what age the winner is or how he or she will use that prize?  I have no doubt there will be a tendency for that person to zoom along the water with scant regard for swimmers, bathers, anglers or other boat users.  In Dun Laoghaire, the harbour master and council have made great efforts to control this by orders and by-laws, but it is an increasing problem in every area where there is water.</P>
    <P>A man died last year in Dublin through the use of a 650cc double cylinder water bike and the jury at the coroner's court made recommendations which, sadly, have been ignored.  Local councils have taken responsibility on themselves to introduce by-laws, but this should not be left to them. We also have a responsibility in this.  Seventy four of our beaches have qualified for blue flag status. Are we putting those blue flags in jeopardy because our beaches may not be safe?</P>
    <P>I will make a number of suggestions.  The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992 is flawed in that whereas it protects the user of the jet ski, it offers no protection to the swimmer who may be hidden under the water, to the fisherman, the bather or any other boat user.  This Act is in urgent need of amendment to extend protection to such people. All jet skis must be registered and insured for third-party cover to the value of £1 million at a minimum.  I recommend that users must hold a licence, that those licence holders, like motorbike users, must be over the age of 16 years and that strict speed restrictions should be set for our coastlines and lakes.  One man has already died here, three have died in England and other accidents are waiting to happen due to the misuse of jet skis on our waters.  I ask the Minister to take action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy aired her concern about the indiscriminate use of jet skis and other recreational fast power craft.  While power craft sports are a legitimate form of marine leisure activity, there is clearly an onus on participants in these sports to behave with the utmost regard for the safety of other water users.  The level of concern expressed by Deputies, public agencies and members of the public suggests there are instances where, perhaps inexperienced operators of these craft, have shown scant regard for safety.  Safety must be a primary and integral part of water sports activities, particularly where power craft are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jet skis, which are also known as personal water craft, together with speed boats, are the most commonly cited craft which have given rise to public concern.  My overriding concern, as Minister with responsibility for the prevention of loss of life at sea and the promotion of sustainable development of marine tourism and leisure, is to ensure such craft are operated in a safe and responsible manner.  I have identified the <Col N="1286" /> need for action on a number of fronts.  A marine safety working group operates under the chairmanship of the director of the Irish marine emergency service of my Department, with the aim of creating and communicating marine safety information and messages to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent loss of life in Irish waters. The safety working group meets regularly and has produced a number of Safety on the Water booklets, leaflets and posters for widespread dissemination.</P>
    <P>I have asked this group to prepare urgently a safety code which will address the safe operation of jet skis and other fast recreational power craft in Ireland.  The purpose of the code will be to heighten awareness of the requirement to operate such craft in a safe manner, with particular regard to the safety of other users of our water based leisure resource.  In drawing up the code, the group will draw on the existing Irish and international experience in this field.  I have asked the group to produce an interim code for dissemination in a matter of weeks.  I intend to ensure this safety code is communicated to purchasers and users of jet skis and fast craft.  Suppliers of such craft will be asked to assist in disseminating such information, whether purchased or hired. Local authorities will be requested to post the code in areas where jet skis and fast craft are used.  Deputy Hanafin is correct in stating that any person of any age can own and use a jet ski.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Marine Institute, whose functions include the promotion of the sustainable development of the marine leisure resource, to immediately examine, with the benefit of independent expertise as necessary, the options for the management of the operation of such craft.  I intend the examination will, among other things, look at appropriate statutory and non-statutory models for management and promotion of the safe use of such craft.  The institute will liaise closely with my Department in the matter and will draw on management models at a number of locations in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I intend to explore further with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the appropriate role for local authorities in the control of recreational power craft, with particular reference to local authorities' functions in the development and management of water based leisure in their areas.  In any event, the Marine Institute's examination of the matter will involve assessing the most appropriate local authority input.  It is also worth noting the published coastal zone management report and discussion document, commissioned by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands which was prepared by Brady Shipman Martin.  The discussion document identified that, within the tourism and leisure area, policies of limitation and curtailment on tourism and leisure development and use are likely to be necessary to deal with the increasing <Col N="1287" /> pressures, possibly coupled with a greater emphasis on quality rather than quantity.  The proposals in the report and discussion document for zonation of coastal areas will clearly have to address the use of the coastal zone for marine leisure, including the operation of recreational fast power craft.  Accordingly, proposals for regulating such craft must take cognisance of the context in which wider proposals are being considered for coastal zone management.</P>
    <P>It is clear the control of recreational fast power craft must be addressed on a number of fronts. My immediate concern is to ensure progress is made as a matter of urgency in raising safety awareness among the users of such craft.  The use of statutory mechanisms to regulate such craft is complex from both safety and legal perspectives, but I am determined that, if statutory measures are identified as being necessary, the various public agencies will agree on a plan of action to implement them.</P>
    <P>As one who lives in possibly one of the most beautiful places in the country, the Hook Peninsula in County Wexford, I am well aware of the concerns raised by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking time out of a busy schedule to come in to deal with the matter.  I propose to share time with my colleague, Deputy Wall.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute on this important matter.  During the past year or so, a large number of retired military personnel have contacted me because they feel aggrieved at the anomalous and discriminatory position created by the Departments of Defence and Finance, whereby a decision was made to limit the payment of the additional military service allowance retrospectively from 1 August 1990, clearly discriminating against those military personnel who retired on or before this date.</P>
      <P>The military service allowance scheme was intended as compensation for the special conditions associated with military life, for example, long unsocial hours, no provision for the payment of overtime and other unique features of employment. It was first introduced for all enlisted personnel and junior officials, up to and including the rank of captain, effective from 1 May 1979.  In 1988, commandants became eligible for payment of MSA and the allowance was extended to senior officials with effect from 1 August 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the matter is that in 1990 the Gleeson Commission on remuneration and conditions of service in the Defence Forces considered that MSA constituted an integral part of military pay and recommended that the Departments of Defence and Finance should give early and positive consideration to the question of making the allowance fully reckonable for superannuation purposes.  It also recommended that the pension <Col N="1288" /> scheme be amended to reflect this recommendation. Subsequently, as a result of discussions &mdash; which I do not think included any members of the Defence Forces pensioners' association &mdash; the military service allowance was introduced as a part of reckonable income for superannuation purposes for personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990.  Surely the Defence Forces pension scheme should be based on the principle of parity, that is, the relationship between the person and the remuneration of his or her successor performing substantially the same duties as those previously discharged by the person in the same employment should be maintained.</P>
    <P>In 1995, a total of 5,600 pensioners, which included officers, enlisted personnel and widows of deceased personnel, were estimated by the Minister's Department to have been excluded from the MSA payment.  At that time it was estimated it would cost about £4 million per annum to pay this group.  However, recent official figures from the Department of Defence have indicated that the total number of pensioners excluded from the MSA additional payment has fallen to 5,060.  So, in less than three years about 550 retired pensioners have died and the number will decline steadily over the coming years.  Therefore, the annual cost of paying the allowance will diminish significantly and will continue to decrease.  I know the Minister has many areas to cover in his Department but he is not being burdened with an ever increasing cost; the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>The decision to limit the payment of the additional military service allowance retrospectively from 1 August 1990 does not stand up when examined on any basis of equity.  The principle of accepting MSA as an integral part of salary does not change in practice by choice of dates and those excluded are clearly being unfairly treated. I urge the Minister to change it now.  Personnel who retired prior to 1 August deserve no less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter concerning discrimination against military personnel who retired before 1 August 1990 with regard to the military service allowance. I thank the Minister for personally taking the matter.</P>
      <P>Consistently, throughout the years, successive Ministers for Defence and other esteemed politicians have referred to the devoted service which our military forces have displayed, not only in Ireland but throughout the world.  In particular, their role in peacekeeping has been commendable. In the Congo, where some of our forces lost their lives, our military personnel did an excellent job.  The anomaly which exists for those retired personnel who retired prior to August 1990 with regard to the military service allowance is effectively a kick in the teeth to those people who put their lives at risk for the good of others.</P>

    <P>Because of disability and other damages inflicted through the type of work in which our Defence Forces have engaged, many have found <Col N="1289" /> that upon having to retire or on reaching retirement, they are left to live in poverty.  This is particularly so for those who leave at quite a young age and who, because of a work inflicted disability, are unable to participate in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The high mortality rate among retired members of the Defence Forces speaks for itself. Each year the numbers in receipt of the military service allowance decreases steadily.  In 1995 a total of 5,600 pensioners were excluded from the MSA.  In 1996 that number had fallen to 5,400.  In the space of 12 months 200 of those had died.  I understand that the trend for more recent years is similar.  Because of this, the cost of extending the MSA, which was estimated to be £4 million in 1995, is dropping all the time.</P>
    <P>Next year is the European Year of the Elderly. Today, the CSO released further evidence that our economy is booming.  Given the valuable service which our forces have provided, I request the Minister to merge these two facts and extend the MSA to those military personnel who have been unjustly excluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Penrose and Wall for raising this matter. The Defence Forces pensions code is unique in the public sector in that provision is made for the payment of immediate pensions and gratuities after unusually short periods of service and regardless of age.</P>
      <P>The minimum service required for a pension and gratuity is 12 years in the case of commissioned officers and 21 years in the case of enlisted personnel.  Maximum pension can be attained after 24 or 25 years' service by officers and 31 years by enlisted personnel.</P>
      <P>Military service allowance, known as MSA, was introduced in 1979 as compensation for the special disadvantages associated with military life and was not reckonable for pension or gratuity purposes.  The inclusion of MSA in the calculation of superannuation benefits for military personnel arose from a recommendation made in 1990 by the commission on remuneration on conditions of service in the Defence Forces &mdash; the Gleeson Commission.</P>
      <P>The agreed arrangements provide, subject to certain conditions, for increases in pensions and gratuities to take account of MSA in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990 &mdash; the day following publication of the Commission's report.  MSA has been reckoned in the calculation of the pensions of all qualified persons who retired since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implementation of the Gleeson Commission's recommendation was the subject of detailed and lengthy discussions with the military representative associations.  In that context, the various arguments in support of the view that MSA should be reflected in the pensions of personnel who retired before 1 August 1990 were fully considered.  However, having regard to the established practice followed in other areas of the <Col N="1290" /> public service and the considerable cost involved, which is not confined to my Department alone, it has not been possible to extend the scope of the commission's recommendation to personnel who retired before 1 August 1990.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson Commission concluded that the overall value of the superannuation benefits provided for the Defence Forces is considerably in excess of those available under other public service schemes.  Deputies may be aware that a commission on public service pensions was established by Government in February 1996 against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging cost of existing public service pensions. The Commission has very broad terms of reference to examine and report on the occupational pension arrangements of public servants, including claims for improvements in existing superannuation benefits.  In that regard, I understand that pensioner groups such as the association of retired commissioned officers and the Irish UN veterans' association were among various groups which made submissions to the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission is an independent body and is scheduled to make its final report to Government in 1998.  In its interim report, published in November 1997, the commission lists the pensionability of overtime and allowances as one of the main issues raised by parties who made submissions. The Government will consider any recommendations the commission may make in this regard.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputies, the pension payable to an NCO or private on retirement consists of: (a) a basic flat rate in respect of 21 years' service, which ranges from £102.59 a week for a private to £152.57 for a sergeant-major; (b) an addition to basic pension of £16.11 a week in respect of MSA, which is 40 per cent of the rate of that allowance; (c) where pensionable service is 31 or more years, there is an increased addition in respect of MSA of £20.14 a week, which is 50 per cent of the rate of that allowance; (d) an additional increment of £3.92 a week in respect of each year of pensionable service in excess of 21 years, but not exceeding 31 years.</P>
    <P>The minimum pension payable to a captain retiring with 12 years' service is £5,218 a year, while the maximum pension for a lieutenantcolonel with 25 years' service is £16,830 a year, inclusive of MSA addition in each case.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that this matter, among other things, is under active consideration.  When the report is made available the Government will be prepared to back positively whatever recommendations emerge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for selecting this item.  I also thank the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, for taking the matter.  I regret the fact that neither the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, nor his Minister of State is available.</P>
    <P>The Western Health board has had to introduce severe and cruel cutbacks in nursing supplies in County Galway.  This was done without consultation or agreement with the people charged with the responsibility of delivering that service to the community &mdash; the public health nurses and carers in their homes.</P>
    <P>Not long ago, an Opposition spokesperson for health stood beside huge hoardings throughout the country declaring that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  Today he is the Minister for Health and Children, yet basic services, such as care for the elderly in their own homes or in nursing homes, are being denied to the very same people.  Is it fair and will the Minister allow this situation to continue?  For example, the carers of an 18 year old girl &mdash; handicapped since birth, epileptic, suffering from severe excema and totally incontinent &mdash; have been told that there is a 50 per cent cutback in incontinence wear, availability has been reduced to five pads per day.</P>
    <P>Changes have taken place in the delivery of a modern caring health service to the community. High technology equipment, such as hoists and hi-lo beds, must be provided for people caring for their loved ones in their homes or in public health nursing homes.  There is a 13 months waiting list for these basic items in the Western Health Board area.  Basic medical supplies are not available in some district nursing care areas.  Nurses are working in difficult, if not impossible, conditions to maintain proper standards.  The chronically sick, the old and the handicapped are suffering as a result.  Will our health services deny people bandages for their wounds or the incapacitated their wheelchairs?  People in County Galway want their parents, the aged and the handicapped to live with dignity in their homes.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to provide adequate funding to the Western Health Board to restore and develop basic public health services in County Galway.  Must we neglect this section in our society at a time of economic boom?  I ask the Minister to act now to alleviate the hardship of people in greatest need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, who is unable to be here tonight.  On his behalf, I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister is conscious of the valuable work done by the public health nurses in the Western Health Board area and appreciates this service. Public health nurses play a vital role at community level in the delivery of a wide range of services, including antenatal and postnatal services, child health services and services for older people, the travelling community and the sick and infirm.  Many in this wide range of client groups are among the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1292" /> In responding to the needs of its client group, the Western Health Board's public health nursing service has expanded considerably in recent years and this has been to the considerable benefit of patients.  Recent expansions to the services being provided include a public health nurse liaison service between the hospital and the community in each of the three counties of the Western Health Board; the introduction of a specialist palliative care service which involves an increased input from public health nurses; considerable development in services designed to promote the breastfeeding of infants and the establishment of a regional public health nursing post to focus on travellers' health needs.</P>
    <P>The introduction of other programmes has placed further demands on the public health nursing system.  In particular, the introduction of a five day postnatal programme for all mothers following discharge from hospital, which I understand is the first of its kind in Ireland, has brought with it extra service requirements for public health nurses.  The introduction of geriatric screening programmes has been a valuable development in the service provided to older people. These extra services are to the value of patients and clients in the community, but these improvements make further demands on public health nurses.  It is an indication of their professionalism that public health nurses have extended their range of services, while continuing to provide high quality, committed care to persons in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The limited resources available throughout the health service means that health boards may at times have to make choices as to what items they can fund.  To contain expenditure within previously agreed levels, I understand the Western Health Board public health nursing service was obliged to prioritise requirements for June, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of nursing supplies ordered for that month.  However, I am informed by the Western Health Board that cutbacks in nursing supplies were not near the level of 50 per cent as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I know the Western Health Board is conscious of the possible hardship that these cutbacks in nursing supplies may have caused some people. It is currently examining ways of meeting the demand in this area to see how best it can be achieved in an equitable and efficient manner. The board is committed to providing the best possible service for all its patients and clients and it will address the issue in this context.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I assure him the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, his Department and the Western Health Board will continue to work closely together to address the concerns he has raised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke will be aware that the greatest increase ever was provided in both the Estimates and the budget this year for health services throughout the country.  The comprehensive capital programme and the extension of services I have listed indicate the Government's commitment <Col N="1293" /> to ensuring we have the best possible health service we can afford.  Problems arise from time to time and these must be addressed carefully, while ensuring that individuals are not neglected because priorities must be maintained.  An exhaustive commitment to finding additional resources in the succeeding years will continue to be the Government's priority in this area.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, is here to respond to our concerns.</P>
      <P>The primary school is the focal point of any community, particularly in a rural community. Those of us who are honoured to be Fianna Fáil public representatives are proud of the excellent track record our party has had in Government over the years in investment in education.  We are also proud of the central role played by our party and by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Education who have given us a system which is the envy of many other countries.  I compliment the Minister on his progressive work and on the many innovative programmes he has introduced since he took up office 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue tonight because problems have arisen in some rural schools as a result of a temporary drop in enrolments.  Two schools in my county, Killoughter and Castletara, will lose teachers for the coming academic year because of this decline.  There is a need to examine closely the needs of multi-class schools.  One of the primary schools I mentioned will have an enrolment next September in excess of what is needed to retain a teacher, but the determination of staffing schedules is based on the enrolment for last September.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister introduce a flexible approach to staffing schedules to ensure that these schools &mdash; there are many others throughout the country &mdash; are not deprived of the extra staff members they need and which they have had over the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the decline in rural Ireland, which is outside the control of most of us, is a factor in the loss of teachers in schools such as Boyle, Castlerea and Enfield in County Roscommon.  It is unfortunate that our children's education suffers as a result.  A number of children attended the school in Boyle last year and it was able to retain its teacher.  However, although it has the same number this year, it is likely to lose a teacher.  There is one more student in a school in Enfield this year than there was last year, yet the assistant teacher has been put on the panel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> An assistant teacher in another school has only one year left before she retires, but she is also being put on the panel.  A new school was built with three classrooms, but two of them are overcrowded while one is closed.  It is difficult for teachers to educate our children in such circumstances. That is not acceptable in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Brendan Smith in thanking the Minister for Education and Science for being here this evening.  I compliment him on the amount of work he has done and the progressive attitude he took last year towards the retention of teachers in two teacher schools.</P>
    <P>Some schools which have had two teachers are likely to lose one and, in many instances, will have only a male teacher.  We know the difficulties that can cause.  We heard the arguments and the debates in this House about mandatory reporting and about legislation to protect persons reporting.  It is not acceptable to expose anybody to that risk and place a person in such circumstances. The confidence and expectations of a local community should not be destroyed, the future of a school put at risk and the likelihood that children will go elsewhere because a second teacher cannot be retained.</P>
    <P>I earnestly request the Minister to reconsider the position and ensure in the short term until the situation improves that teachers will be left where they have been for the past 12 months and can make a progressive contribution to the education of the children in those schools over the next 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this matter.  Retaining staffing levels is becoming an increasing problem, particularly on the western seaboard and, I am sure, in the Chair's constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  It is also a problem in County Louth where demographic change is leaving small rural schools seriously exposed.  It goes without saying that two teacher or three teacher schools have an in-built disadvantage as far as the pupils, their parents and the schools are concerned.  Larger schools have advantages in that they have greater flexibility and focus in the teaching process. There is not much we can do about this by speaking on this matter tonight.  We must face the reality that small schools are at a disadvantage and that will be exacerbated with the passage of time.</P>
      <P>The Minister has a special interest in smaller schools generally, particularly those in danger of losing teachers because of decreasing numbers. My colleagues, Deputies Brendan Smith and Doherty, mentioned schools in their constituencies and I wish to mention Mullaghbuoy national school in the Cooley Mountains.  Will the Minister take this opportunity to examine the position there, having regard to the projected enrolment for next September and the special needs of that school, which the principal has highlighted to the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> Department?  The Minister is dedicated to ensuring equality in the education system and I have no doubt he will apply his mind to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The staffing of our national schools is a very important issue which concerns every community and I thank my colleagues for giving me an opportunity to address it this evening.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, student numbers provide the basis for staffing and funding of national schools.  The staffing allocation of each school is specifically determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  That accords with an agreement on staffing which has been entered into between the Government and the INTO and which has been in place for a number of years. This agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since its introduction.  While it leads to many issues concerning projected enrolments, it is the fairest and most objective way of determining staffing on a nationwide basis.  That said, flexibility is shown in that an additional allocation can be made where a school can show that it would not be able to comply with maximum class guidelines without an additional teacher.  In relation to Deputy Smith's point, every September if schools show an increase in enrolment and show that they cannot adhere to maximum guidelines, we will inspect them, reassess the situation and see if we can be of assistance.</P>
      <P>Arising from the agreement referred to above, a staffing schedule is drafted annually.  The schedule sets out the relevant enrolment which schools must have attained on 30 September of the previous year in order to qualify for extra staffing. Likewise, the schedule specifies the minimum enrolment required to have been attained in order to retain posts.</P>
      <P>It is important that I emphasise that the withdrawal of teaching posts in primary schools arises in virtually every case because of enrolment decline.  The unfortunate reality is the schools which are losing posts are those which in September 1997 failed to achieve a specified enrolment level.  This year 393 teaching posts are being lost by schools because of falling enrolments.  This is significantly smaller than the 603 posts which were lost last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the policy initiated by my predecessor as Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, over ten years ago, it has been policy to use these surplus posts and redistribute them in the primary system.  Through this, there has been an improvement <Col N="1296" /> in the basic staffing schedule and the provision of teachers for special needs over the years. That is the policy I am following this year.</P>
    <P>Of the 393 posts, over 200 will be redeployed as normal class teachers because of an improvement in the staffing schedule from this school year.  It is my intention to use the remaining posts to address specific educational needs, including the particular problems of small rural communities, embracing remedial teaching posts and resource posts.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the commitment contained in the programme for Government to give an extra teacher to every one teacher school with ten pupils or more.  I began the implementation of that policy soon after appointment when I allocated 24 posts to schools which were due to fall to one teacher.  We will go further in the coming year and will have completely implemented the commitment well within the lifetime of the Government.  This policy will make a direct impact in some of the smallest communities in the country.</P>
    <P>On the specific point mentioned by the Deputies, I recognise that difficulties are caused in places where there are only small declines in enrolments.  However, the only way in which this can be addressed is through a general improvement in staffing schedules.  This could not be achieved without a move away from the idea of a staffing schedule as an improvement in the basic numbers for retention of teachers would still lead to hard cases.  In any event, there are only limited resources available to me in any one year.  Were I to use all of the posts to change the staffing schedule, I would not be able to make any improvements on tackling special needs, providing for one teacher schools or for additional resources for remedial teaching posts.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that additional teaching resources are needed, but I must have regard for the overall level of resources available to me and the fact that this Government is committed to protecting our economic growth through a responsible fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>This year I succeeded in securing an 11 per cent increase in the funding available to the primary sector.  This was an important start and the Government is fulfilling its promise to prioritise primary education.  This funding is already making an impact in schools throughout the country. However, I assure the Deputies I appreciate the points they raised and the issues they articulated and I hope to address them in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Troika of EU Heads of Mission from Jakarta visited East Timor from 27 to 30 June.  The purpose of the visit was to demonstrate the EUs continuing concern about the situation in East Timor, to improve the EUs understanding of the issue and to support the efforts being made under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to promote an agreed settlement which will be acceptable to all sides.</P>
      <P>A full account of the visit has not yet been received from the EU Presidency but it is our understanding that much of value was achieved during the visit and that several important contacts were established which will be helpful in the search for a negotiated settlement of this long-standing problem.</P>
      <P>It was with great dismay, however, that I learnt of the incident which occurred when the Troika of Ambassadors was visiting the Bishop of Baucau, Monsignor Nascimento.  It appears that the Indonesian security forces shot dead one demonstrator and wounded several others in the course of disturbances outside Bishop Nascimentos residence while the meeting was taking place inside. There have also been distressing reports of at least one death in Dili during clashes on 27 June between pro-independence and pro-Indonesian demonstrators.</P>
      <P>The Government very much regrets these tragic deaths in East Timor over the last week and urges that the utmost restraint be exercised in order to avoid further bloodshed.  The EU has asked the authorities to carry out a full investigation into the shooting in Baucau to make sure that those responsible are made accountable.  The close involvement of Bishop Nascimento in the investigation has also been requested.</P>
      <P>These deaths highlight in a tragic way the underlying problem &mdash; namely the repression exercised by the Indonesian security forces and the tension to which this has given rise.  They reinforce the importance of resolving the issue in a peaceful manner at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to stress once again the Government's commitment &mdash; and that of our EU partners &mdash; to achieving a peaceful negotiated settlement of the East Timor problem which will be internationally acceptable and which will fully respect the interests and legitimate aspirations of the Timorese people. <Col N="1298" /></P>

      <P>On a number of occasions, the Government has decided to admit groups of people, known as programme refugees, into Ireland who have been displaced from their homes as a consequence of war. In recent years, these groups have mainly consisted of Bosnians.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, different groups of Bosnians, including a number of medical evacuees, have been admitted from the former Yugoslavia.  The Government decisions in relation to these persons were taken following appeals from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These Bosnians have been allowed to remain in Ireland indefinitely.  In addition, a repatriation programme operates to facilitate those Bosnians who wish to return to their own country.  The Refugee Agency, under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, is responsible for the co-ordination of reception and resettlement services for persons brought to Ireland following a Government decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 20, 35 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>The political and economic situation in Indonesia has been changing rapidly in recent months. The European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15/16 June encouraged the new Indonesian President, Mr. B. J. Habibie, to implement his commitment to political and economic reform and his stated intention to hold early elections next year and to honour all foreign commitments.  Similar conclusions, stressing the need for reform, were previously agreed at the General Affairs Council meetings held in Brussels on 25 May and in Luxembourg on 8 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that recent developments in Indonesia will have an important impact on the situation in East Timor.  A window of opportunity may therefore be opening up which may allow the longstanding problem of East Timor to be dealt with in a fair and equitable manner.  Every <Col N="1302" /> encouragement must accordingly be given to the Indonesian Government to meet its obligations under the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and to grant the East Timorese people their rights under international law.</P>
    <P>On 27 May I issued a statement calling for the release of the jailed East Timor resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, and all other political prisoners in Indonesia.  Shortly afterwards, the British Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Derek Fatchett, travelled to Jakarta on behalf of the EU Presidency and succeeded in securing a meeting with the prisoner himself. There are no plans at present, however, for a visit to be made to Mr Gusmao by the EU Ambassadors in Jakarta.</P>
    <P>The question of Mr Gusmao's release has also been raised at the EU Council of Ministers and at the European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15/16 June.  The European Council called on Indonesia to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and sought the release of all political prisoners, including Xanana Gusmao and others from East Timor.</P>
    <P>Ireland and our partners in the EU would very much favour the disengagement of Indonesian military contingents from East Timor.  President Habibie has in fact already indicated a willingness to engage in a phased withdrawal of troops but it is not clear precisely when and under what conditions he may be willing to proceed with this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Indonesian authorities can be in no doubt about the strength of the Governments views on the question of East Timor and on the deplorable human rights situation that exists in the territory. While I have no plans at present to make a visit to the region, I intend to avail of every appropriate opportunity to raise the issue with my colleagues from the EU and other countries on all suitable occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 70 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directly prior to President Clinton's visit to China, I had the opportunity to accompany President McAleese to a meeting in Washington with Mr. Clinton and his Secretary of State, Madeleine <Col N="1303" /> Albright.  I was fortunate to have a brief exchange of views with President Clinton on that occasion regarding his forthcoming trip.</P>
    <P>I am aware that certain pro-democracy activists were arrested last month by the Chinese Government. This is an action which I very much regret and I can only hope that they will be released without delay.  There is reason to believe, nevertheless, that the human rights situation in China has improved somewhat as a result of the increased level of dialogue which has been undertaken with China by the European Union, the United States and other countries in recent times. This week's official visit by President Clinton to China can be regarded as part of this process and is to be welcomed.  The public remarks made by the President on the question of human rights can only have a positive impact on the appropriate development of Chinese society and the promotion of civil liberties.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped and expected that the ongoing EU-China human rights dialogue &mdash; at which individual cases of human rights violations are regularly raised &mdash; will lead also to a genuine commitment on the part of China to promote the conditions where full respect for human rights will be possible.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1994.  The adoption of the Convention reflected the widespread concern felt at the growing number of deaths and injuries resulting from deliberate attacks against UN and associated personnel. Attacks against, or other mistreatment of, personnel who act on behalf of the UN are unjustifiable and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The current international position is that the Convention is not yet in force and will not enter into force until 30 days after the deposit with the UN Secretary-General of the instruments of ratification, acceptance or accession of 22 countries. As of 1 July 1998, there were 43 signatories and 19 states parties to the Convention.</P>
      <P>Given that the Convention remained open for signature only until 31 December, 1995, Ireland is not now in a position to sign the Convention. In order to become party to the Convention, Ireland will have to proceed by way of accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from an examination of the terms of the Convention that domestic legislative measures will have to be enacted in order to give effect to the provisions of the Convention in Irish <Col N="1304" /> law.  I wish to assure the House that, once the legislation has been put in place, there will be no delay on the part of the Department of Foreign Affairs in taking the appropriate steps to lodge Ireland's instrument of accession.</P>

      <P>As the Government's representative, I accompanied President Mary McAleese on the Washington leg of her five day official visit to Washington and New York last week.  This was the Presidents first visit to the United States since she became President last year.</P>
      <P>One of the highlights of the visit was the meeting with President Clinton at the White House, where the occasion was used, <i>inter alia</i>, to brief the US President on developments in Northern Ireland.  We also took the opportunity to thank the President for his continuing personal interest in and commitment to the search for peace in Ireland.</P>
      <P>During the visit to Washington, President McAleese addressed the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the National Press Clubs Morning Newsmaker Session.  She received the Presidents medal at Georgetown University and made a major address at the awards ceremony. She attended luncheons as the guest of honour at the US Supreme Court and the House International Relations Committee on Capitol Hill.  The President also did a number of television, radio and newspaper interviews during the visit to Washington.</P>
      <P>After Washington, President McAleese proceeded to fulfil a number of appointments in New York, while I travelled to Poland for official talks with the Polish Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 26, 65, 69 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>At the Cardiff European Council, Heads of State or Government held a wide-ranging luncheon discussion about the future development of the European Union, against the background of the important policy developments during the past year.  The European Council agreed to deepen discussion at an informal meeting of Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission, probably in late October, and to consider how best to prepare for these issues to be considered at the Vienna European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commission and Council initiatives to improve their own effectiveness and functioning were among the elements in the discussion at Cardiff. The Council and the Commission were invited to report on progress on these issues in the next Presidency.  One of the major concerns identified by member states at the European Council, and <Col N="1306" /> indeed a recurring theme at the General Affairs Council (GAC) itself over the past year, has been the need to improve the workings of the GAC. One idea floated as a means of assisting the General Affairs Council with its extensive workload was that of splitting the GAC so as to separate external relations issues from its co-ordination functions.</P>
    <P>The working arrangements of the Council, notably the General Affairs Council (GAC), will be discussed by Foreign Ministers at the informal ministerial meeting in Salzburg in September on the basis of an interim report by the Secretary-General of the Council.  Foreign Ministers deliberations on this issue will, no doubt, constitute a useful input to the informal meeting of Heads of State or Government in October.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the operation of the GAC could be improved and Ireland is open to proposals for reform of its working methods.  A number of reports on the functioning of the GAC are in preparation by the Council Secretariat.  We will study these carefully when they become available as well as all other proposals put forward and we will then take a view on how the working methods of Council and in particular the General Affairs Council might best be improved. However, we would see a continued clear need for one single body to take a strategic overview of the ongoing EU agenda.  I believe the General Affairs Council is best placed to exercise this co-ordinating role in addition to its external relations function.  I am not sure therefore that the way forward is to consider the creation of another Council or Committee.</P>

      <P>In his six monthly report on 10 June to the UN Security Council on the UN operation in Cyprus the UN Secretary General indicated that the situation along the ceasefire lines was relatively calm, despite minor violations.  Both sides continued to respect the ceasefire arrangement of 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tension increased on the island in early June after six Turkish warplanes landed in the north of the island two days after four Greek military planes visited the south.  This came against the background of the recent opening of a military airstrip at Paphos on the southern part of the island and indications earlier from the Cypriot Government of their intention to deploy a number of Russian S-300 ground to air missiles.  The warplanes are reported to have left the island and there are reports that the Cypriot Government is considering postponing deployment of the ground to air missiles until October-November.  President Clerides has also written to the UN Secretary General putting forward concrete proposals for the demilitarisation of the island.  These issues will be among those addressed by Mr. Diego Cordovez, the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, who is scheduled to begin a visit to Cyprus on Thursday 2 July to try to restart <Col N="1308" /> talks between both sides, aimed at an overall political solution.</P>
    <P>The Government shares the concern expressed by the UN Secretary-General, and the wider international community, at the military build-up on Cyprus including the high level of Turkish forces in northern Cyprus.  We fully support the efforts by the United Nations to address these issues and to try to restart the direct talks between both sides aimed at achieving an overall political solution to the Cyprus question.  The UN framework of a bi-zonal, bi-communal, federal approach remains, in our view, the appropriate one for an eventual settlement in Cyprus.  The Government will continue to monitor the situation there closely and to offer the UN every support.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Group on Agenda 2000 has met four times in 1998.  The role of the group, which is chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is to consider Ireland's overall strategy in relation to the Agenda 2000 negotiations and to report in that regard to the Ministers and Secretaries General Group on EU policy chaired by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Much of the co-ordination between the Departments concerned takes place, of course, on a more informal day-to-day basis within the overall policy approach agreed by the Ministers and Secretaries General Group.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 negotiations are set to run for some time.  The aim established by the Cardiff European Council is that political agreement be reached on the Agenda 2000 package no later than March next year.

      <P>It will be important to maintain a co-ordinated approach to the Agenda 2000 negotiations.  I am satisfied with the arrangements established in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 68 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>Because of the small size of our foreign service, Ireland is not in a position at the present time to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba. However, the lack of formal diplomatic relations does not inhibit the maintenance and development of friendly contacts and relations with that country.</P>
      <P>The Government wishes to see an end to the US economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.  We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners. Ireland, along with all our European Union partners, has voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of calls for an end to the embargo.  The US Administration has been made fully aware of Irelands concerns, and that of our EU partners, about the embargo and its extraterritorial effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have placed on record in this House the Government's welcome for the statement by President Clinton on 20 March which announced <Col N="1310" /> a number of openings in US contacts with Cuba, primarily of a humanitarian nature.</P>
    <P>The Government also wish to see the Cuban Government undertake sustained action to respect human rights and promote democracy within Cuba.  Along with our EU partners, Ireland has voted in the UN General Assembly in favour of calls on the Government of Cuba to bring its observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba into conformity with international standards and to end the violations of human rights, in particular, the detention and imprisonment of human rights defenders.</P>
    <P>Following the Papal visit earlier this year, a number of prisoners of conscience were freed by the Cuban authorities.  I hope that these releases will be followed by those of other prisoners of conscience, including the four members of the Dissidents' Working Group.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the implementation of the European Union's Common Position on Cuba last month, the EU General Affairs Council reiterated that the Union's objective towards Cuba remained the encouragement of a process of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and a sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.</P>
    <P>In line with these objectives, the General Affairs Council, at its most recent meeting on 29 June, decided to accede to Cuba's request for observer status at the forthcoming negotiations on a new Lomé Convention.  However, the granting of observer status is without prejudice to any future decision on Cuban membership of the Lomé Convention.  In this connection, the General Affairs Council recalled that full co-operation with Cuba, including Cuban membership of the Lomé Convention, will depend upon substantial progress on human rights, good governance and political freedoms in accordance with the provisions of the EU Common Position on Cuba. In particular, the EU wish to see an end to the obstruction of the Havana Ambassadors Human Rights Working Group, and the release of the four members of the Dissidents Working Group.</P>

      <P>In the context of a wide-ranging discussion about the future development of the European Union, the Cardiff European Council agreed on the need to bring the EU closer to people and to focus it on the issues that matter most to the European <Col N="1311" /> citizens.  As a first step, it is intended to convene, probably in October, an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission to deepen their discussion and to examine how best to prepare for these issues to be considered at the Vienna European Council.</P>
      <P>Television and radio coverage of Council meetings was not discussed at Cardiff.  The broadcasting of Council meetings and debates is part of the wider efforts being made by the European Union in the interests of transparency and of bringing the EU closer to its people.  The meeting of the European Council in Edinburgh in December 1992 approved the transmission by audiovisual means of certain meetings of the Council of Ministers, in an effort to enhance transparency, and a Council decision of May 1995 extended the practice. As the Deputy will be aware, the present practice is that the Councils policy debates on the six-monthly work programme submitted by the Presidency and, if appropriate, on the Commissions annual work programme, are retransmitted audiovisually.  In addition, certain debates relating to important issues affecting the interests of the Union or significant new legislative proposals may be broadcast on television and radio.</P>
      <P>Ireland is committed to transparency in the work of the European Union institutions and has welcomed the measures taken to date to make its decision-making processes and deliberations more open and better understood by the public.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 31 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of profound regret that an agreed accommodation was not found before the Parades Commission had to make its determination on the Drumcree parade.  Successive Governments have accepted that the most effective way forward on contentious parades is for those most directly involved to engage in dialogue.  In the absence of an agreed outcome based on dialogue, the rule of law should be respected.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that the Government has left no stone unturned in its efforts to encourage dialogue and agreement.  Obviously, our contacts and exchanges with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and with the British authorities generally will continue and intensify over the coming days.  The Taoiseach, for example, discussed the matter most recently with the British Prime Minister in Frankfurt.  We remain in contact with the parties on the ground in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach and I met during the week with the leadership of the SDLP and Sinn Féin and Drumcree obviously featured in our discussions.</P>
      <P>As the day of the march fast approaches, time is obviously running short in terms of the search for dialogue and local agreement.  We will continue to encourage such local agreement. However, the determination of the Parades Commission is in effect a statement of the law of land in regard to the Drumcree parade.  I would urge everyone to respect that determination.  To those who would wish to dissent from it, I would urge that they do so peacefully and with restraint. Confrontation and the perpetuation of conflict over this parade is clearly contrary to the real interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have previously stated in this House my belief that Ireland's policy of military neutrality has a positive and constructive value.  It is an important element of our foreign policy, reflected in our approach of active engagement with key international issues.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality has been in keeping with the desire of Irish people to see Ireland play a constructive and honourable role in international efforts to address the causes of conflict, to respond to international crises and humanitarian disasters when they occur and to contribute to the efforts of the international community to manage and bring to an end such crises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 47, 64, 73, 75 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is very concerned about the humanitarian situation in southern Sudan where the cumulative effects of war, insecurity and erratic rainfall have led to immense human suffering. The UN World Food Programme, WFP, now estimates that 1.2 million people in southern Sudan are in critical need of food assistance.  In addition, some 1.4 million are considered to need food aid in the north.  The worst affected areas include parts of northern Bahr el Ghazal, Eastern Equatoria and western Upper Nile.  Large numbers of people are displaced and have little or no access to food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifteen years of civil war resulting in continuous displacement of people and increasing law-lessness has exhausted the coping capacity of the civilian population in southern Sudan.  The humanitarian crisis has been ongoing for a number of years but deteriorated significantly this year in part because of a very poor harvest last year and in part due to the intensification of hostilities in 1997 and in early 1998.  Prospects for the coming harvest are not encouraging due to delayed and erratic rainfall.  In addition, there are indications that the persistent conflict and looting has resulted in a much smaller area under cultivation. This, together with a shortage of seeds <Col N="1315" /> and tools, points to a much longer-term food crisis.</P>
    <P>From 1994-97 the Government donated £2,246,000 to address the ongoing humanitarian emergency in Sudan and we have responded immediately to the present crisis by allocating over £884,000 for urgent humanitarian assistance in the past two months.  Further assistance is under active consideration.  At the same time, we acknowledge that humanitarian aid cannot be a substitute for political action and an end to the civil war offers the only long-term solution to the appalling conditions the civilian population is enduring.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I have worked continuously to keep the situation in Sudan on the international humanitarian and political agendas.  At Irelands request, Sudan was discussed at a number of EU ministerial level meetings including the last meeting of Development Co-operation Ministers, the Cardiff European Council and the most recent General Affairs Council which took place on Monday and Tuesday of this week.  The Council noted the substantial assistance provided by the EU over recent years and the continuing and increasingly urgent need for humanitarian assistance.  The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, and the European Commissions Food Aid Directorate have made substantial contributions to the relief effort in the past and are considering further contributions.</P>
    <P>The recent General Affairs Council also reaffirmed EU support for the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, peace process. The Council welcomed the proposal that the IGAD Partners Forum send a mission at ministerial level to Khartoum and Nairobi to explore the possibility of enhanced and secure access for the delivery of badly needed humanitarian assistance. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, participated in the IGAD Partners Forum in The Hague on 17 and 18 June which made this proposal and is actively engaged in taking it forward.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also been active on a bilateral basis and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, visited Khartoum on 7 June to convey the Governments concerns to the Sudanese authorities.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, had an intensive round of discussions with members of the Government of Sudan and with UN officials leading the relief effort and pressed for urgent action to address the humanitarian crisis through better access and increased resources and to make concrete progress on an early ceasefire and an agreed framework for negotiations.</P>
    <P>The main response by the international community to the emergency is managed by Operation Lifeline Sudan, OLS.  OLS is a UN-led consortium of international humanitarian agencies <Col N="1316" /> including the UN World Food Programme, UNICEF and 35 non-governmental organisations. A number of NGOs operate outside but in complement to the OLS arrangement.  It was established in 1989 as a result of the impotence of the international community in the face of a similar war-related famine in Bahr el Ghazel in 1988 and through agreement with the Government of Sudan delivers humanitarian aid to those communities most affected by conflict and drought in rebel held and Government controlled territories in southern Sudan.  OLS also provides humanitarian assistance to needy people in the north.  Within Operation Lifeline Sudan, the World Food Programme takes the lead role in the delivery of food aid.  Ireland and other donors are working with OLS to increase the effectiveness of the relief operation and to try to ensure that the targets are met regarding the delivery of food aid to the most needy.</P>
    <P>In February this year OLS warned that &ldquo;During the next twelve months, large parts of Sudan are expected to experience the worst humanitarian conditions since 1994 when similar conditions destroyed hundreds of Sudanese communities and put hundreds of thousands of Sudanese at risk.&rdquo; Despite this warning, the international response to the OLS appeal for funding was relatively poor, continuing a pattern established over recent years.  At around the same time a major rebel offensive took place in the Bahr el Ghazel region resulting in further large scale displacement of people.  The Sudanese Government banned humanitarian relief operations thus disrupting the delivery of essential humanitarian supplies.  Following international protests, OLS has been allowed to increase the number of aircraft and flights and the rebel forces have been co-operative in ensuring access in the areas under their control.  Current relief efforts are aimed at meeting the most immediate food needs and at supplying essential non-food items, where feasible.</P>
    <P>With increasing access, WFP was in a position to review the scale of the humanitarian problem and revised upwards the number of people in critical need of food and the amount of food to be provided per person.  There has been concern that OLS/WFP has not been moving fast enough and this has been acknowledged by WFP. However, the bulk of food supplies has to be transported by air because roads and bridges have been destroyed by warring parties, washed out by rains or are heavily landmined.  In addition, road transport is particularly insecure due to attacks by bandits.</P>
    <P>WFP has been working steadily to increase the size of the airlift and announced last week that the Government of Sudan has agreed to the doubling of the number of aircraft in use which will allow WFP to transport about 10,000 metric tons of food a month by air.  This will bring the <Col N="1317" /> total number of aircraft to 12.  Eight aircraft will operate out of Lokichoggio, the main OLS logistics base for delivery into the south located in north-west Kenya, and Nairobi and four aircraft from El Obeid and Khartoum in Sudan.  Facilities at Lokichoggio will have to be upgraded and WFP is in consultation with donors about the provision of additional aircraft parking and night lighting.</P>
    <P>Air transport is extremely expensive and, if the principle of safe humanitarian corridors is guaranteed by all parties concerned to allow unhindered access to those in need in the south, WFP have established that it would be feasible to deliver food by road from Lokichoggio and from Koboko in Uganda to a number of very vulnerable communities.  There is already a small road transport operation based at Lokichoggio.  This would entail not only the establishment of a fleet of trucks and all the necessary logistical back-up but also the repair of roads and bridges, the latter will cost $5.5 million approximately.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks substantial additional resources have been allocated to WFP by a number of donors particularly the UK and the USA. A total of US$58.7 million has been confirmed leaving a shortfall of US$78.7 million needed to provide food aid to northern and southern Sudan in the period up to April 1999.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to monitor the situation very closely, particularly the delivery of food aid and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, and I will remain actively engaged in seeking ways to alleviate the suffering of the Sudanese people in both the short and longer terms.</P>

      <P>The appalling human rights situation in Colombia continues to be of serious concern to Ireland and our EU partners.  I am particularly concerned at the killings of human rights defenders and the <Col N="1318" /> harassment and threats directed at human rights activists.  In this regard, I share the widespread international concern about the activities of paramilitary and vigilante groups operating with the support or acquiescence of the armed forces in that country, as well as groups opposed to the armed forces.  The victims are the innocent people of Colombia and dedicated individuals who have pledged themselves to advance the cause of human rights.</P>
      <P>The European Union has been following with close interest and concern the human rights situation in Colombia and has conveyed its concerns to the Government of Colombia.  The EU was particularly shocked by the murders of prominent and respected personalities active in public life, including Jesus Maria Valle, Maria Arango Fonnegra and Eduardo Umana.  The EU unreservedly condemned these killings.</P>
      <P>The European Union considers that the best deterrent against the continuation of such atrocities would be the arrest and trial of the authors and perpetrators of such crimes and has urged the Colombian authorities to do all they can to bring to justice those responsible for these crimes.</P>
      <P>The EU has also conveyed to the Colombian authorities its concern about the threats received by other prominent individuals working for peace and has urged that highest priority be given to providing protection for those people working to promote respect for human rights in Colombia.</P>

      <P>On 15 June 1998 the UN Security Council extended the mandate of the existing SFOR for a further planned period of 12 months.  The continued presence of the Irish contingent in SFOR, and the financial responsibilities which arise from Irish participation, were approved by the Dáil through a motion adopted on 18 June, following a Government decision of 16 June in favour of Ireland's continued participation in SFOR.</P>
      <P>SFOR continues to play an indispensable role in preserving peace and contributing to a climate of stability in which the political and democratic process must be pursued.  I attach great importance to Ireland's continuing participation in SFOR.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Cardiff did not discuss the methodology for the appointment of the next President of the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The procedure for appointing the President of the Commission is set out in the treaties.  Article 158 of the EC Treaty provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Governments of the member states shall nominate by common accord, after consulting the European Parliament, the person they intend to appoint as President of the Commission.  The Treaty of Amsterdam will amend these provisions by requiring that the nomination shall be approved by the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the proposal made by an organisation chaired by Mr. Delors, which envisions that each of the European political groups should choose a candidate for the position of President of the European Commission prior to the next European Parliament elections scheduled to be held in June 1999.  As I understand it, the proposal made by Mr. Delors, organisation is addressed in the first instance to European political <Col N="1320" /> groups which will, no doubt, give it careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Ireland's overall approach on EU institutional matters is guided by the need to respect fully the relevant treaty provisions, to ensure the maintenance of the essential balance between the Union's institutions and to safeguard the rights of smaller member states.  The task ahead of us at this stage must be to bring the Treaty of Amsterdam into force and to apply its sensible and welcome provisions including in relation to the procedure for appointing the President of the Commission.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental committee on the development of the Battle of the Boyne site met for the first time in March this year.  The committee consists of representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs; Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; Environment and Local Government; as well as the Office of Public Works and Bord Fáilte.  It is chaired by a senior official of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the committee are to examine how best to develop the historic Battle of the Boyne site and to encourage and facilitate an understanding of the battle, in the context of promoting reconciliation and mutual understanding on the island of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The committee has met on two occasions and a further meeting is planned for next week.  At the last meeting, the committee approved a comprehensive research and planning proposal prepared by experts at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The research envisaged will involve an initial programme to establish an inventory of all known historical and archaeological material and the creation of an extensive cartographic and photographic record, identification of significant locations in the battlefield and the development of a greater understanding of the wider context of the event.</P>
      <P>The planning study will be designed to look at the optimal visitor circulation and traffic patterns, infrastructural requirements, land use and developmental issues, visitor facilities, viewing points and signage.  It will also include recommendations for ongoing management and further research. Once the research and planning stages are completed, the committee will examine proposals for the longer term development of the site.</P>

    <P>The British-Irish Agreement has given added <Col N="1321" /> impetus and importance to the project.  The Agreement commits the Government to continue to take further active steps to demonstrate its respect for the different traditions in the island of Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Government provided the British Government with a list of potential members of the policing commission, including a number of international names.  One of these nominees was appointed to the commission by the British Government when its full membership was announced on 3 June 1998.  Before this announcement, there were intensive discussions between the two Governments, both at political and official level, including on the nature of the expertise required of the membership.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work in close consultation with the British Government to implement all the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>In approving the proposed amendments to the Constitution required to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Irish electorate, for the third time since our accession to the EU, has shown its continued support for keeping Ireland at the forefront of European integration.  The people accepted the treaty by a substantial majority and, in my view, did a service to the further integration of Europe and to Ireland's place in Europe.  The Treaty of Amsterdam is the next and necessary step in achieving the objectives of all the member states of the European Union to make Europe an area of freedom security and justice and to strengthen the Union's capacity to address those issues which are of most concern to its citizens.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General is currently considering the extent to which, if any, it may be necessary to define in legislation the role and responsibilities of the North/South Ministerial Council.  Legislation will be required to establish the North/South Implementation Bodies which must first be identified by the deadline of 31 October as set out in the British-Irish Agreement.</P>

In that regard, I would refer the Deputies to the response provided by that Minister to Parliamentary Question No. 49 from Deputy Rabbitte on 25 June.  Since then, there have been two further developments of relevance.  The Decommissioning Act, 1997 (Decommissioning) Regulations, 1998 and the Decommissioning Act, 1997 (Sections 5 and 6) (Commencement) Order 1998 were made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The same Minister also published the Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Bill, 1998, on Tuesday, with all Stages to be taken in the House today and in the Seanad tomorrow. <Col N="1323" /></P>

      <P>The Government, together with our partners in the European Union, is most concerned at the current stalemate in the Middle East Peace Process.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the approach of Mr. Netanyahu's government to the implementation of the Oslo Agreement has been fundamentally different from that of its predecessor.  Considerations relating to Israel's security have been predominant. Discussions with Syria about a possible IsraeliSyrian peace agreement were halted.  While there was limited redeployment of Israeli troops from Hebron, Mr. Netanyahu introduced a number of unilateral measures, such as the building of new Israeli settlements at Har Homa/Jebel Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem, which were seen as particularly provocative by the Palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, negotiations to give effect to the second redeployment of Israeli troops from part of the occupied territories which they overran in 1967, as provided for under the Oslo Accord, have been stalled for over a year. Despite strenuous efforts since last summer by the US Administration to restart the process &mdash; efforts which Ireland and other European Union member states have fully supported &mdash; there has been no significant movement.  The US negotiators have sought to link progress in redeployment by Israel with progress by the Palestinians in tackling terrorism.  Though they have secured Palestinian agreement to an offer involving a modest redeployment from the occupied territories, Mr. Netanyahu has indicated that he cannot accept even this limited proposal.</P>
      <P>We are conscious that time is running out for a settlement under the Oslo Agreement.  The necessary common ground has not been found between the Israelis and the Palestinians and there is a loss of confidence that it will be found. The recent plan for extending boundaries of Jerusalem, adopted this month, again unilaterally, by Prime Minister Netanyahu's government, has further undermined Palestinian confidence, reinforcing the perception that the Israeli authorities are endeavouring to reduce the number of Palestinians living in Jerusalem.</P>
      <P>The critical situation in the Middle East Peace Process was considered by the General Affairs Council which I attended at Luxembourg last Monday.  The EU Special Envoy, Ambassador Moratinos, gave a comprehensive briefing.  The council called on Israel to give a clear and positive response to the US ideas for relaunching negotiations and reiterated its deep concern at the Israeli Government's new plan for Jerusalem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> In the meantime, contact has been maintained with both sides and new proposals are being examined.  France and Egypt, for example, have proposed an international conference in an effort to reinvigorate the peace process, and, for our part, we are willing to discuss and support every effort at progress.  Both nationally and with our partners in Europe, we will continue to urge on all the parties the overriding importance of moving ahead with the peace process.</P>

      <P>The issue of human rights is a priority concern of this Government and, as such, is a central component of our foreign policy.  We believe that the international community has legitimate concerns in this area and we are conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with our EU partners we continue to monitor closely the human rights situations in a number of countries.  On many occasions we have identified situations giving cause for serious concern.  For example, at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva earlier this year, the common EU statement highlighted our concern at human rights violations in a number of countries, such as China, Chad, Cuba, Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, Niger, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Burundi, Rwanda, Belarus, Cambodia, Russian Republic of Chechnya, Colombia, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Haiti, Indonesia, Kashmir, Kenya, Liberia, Mexico, Peru, Tajikistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, Cyprus, Bhutan, Papua New Guinea, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sri Lanka.  In addition, the EU tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in Nigeria, Burma, Iran, Iraq, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Occupied Arab Territories.</P>
      <P>It may be necessary to address a number of these concerns again at the next session of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly in November.  Hopefully, we will also be in a position to welcome improvements in this area as a result of international efforts and dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will continue to fulfil its obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards.  We will take every opportunity <Col N="1325" /> to raise our concerns in the most appropriate international fora such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.  We will pursue this policy both in a bilateral context and in partnership with other EU member states.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government hopes that the new regime of General Abubakar will move rapidly to restore democracy and the rule of law to Nigeria.  The Government has been deeply concerned about the situation in Nigeria, notably the widespread violations of human rights and the failure to date of the process of transition to civilian rule.  We very much hope that General Abubakar will now fulfil General Abacha's commitments with regard to ensuring a return to democracy and the rule of law before 1 October 1998.  The election of a civilian government will not only restore democracy to the people of Nigeria, but also significantly improve the country's standing internationally.</P>
      <P>General Abubakar's actions during his first weeks in office have given some grounds for cautious optimism.  He has indicated his intention to hold elections and to consult widely within Nigeria beforehand.  On 15 June, the release of nine political prisoners, including former Head of State General Obasanjo, was announced.  This was followed on 25 June by the announcement that a further 17 detainees were to be released.</P>
      <P>General Abubakar's call on Nigerians to join in a process of reconstruction and reconciliation has been welcomed by Ireland and its EU partners. The EU has indicated its wish for a constructive dialogue with Nigeria and its readiness to support Nigeria in its efforts to establish an inclusive democracy.  In his capacity as representative of the EU Presidency, UK Minister of State Tony Lloyd travelled to Nigeria to meet General Abubakar on 26 June.  At that meeting, General Abubakar outlined his plans for moves towards the restoration of democracy and Minister Lloyd confirmed the EUs willingness to support this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any easing of current EU measures regarding Nigeria remains, however, strictly subject to the realisation of fundamental changes in that country. Prior to the death of General Abacha, the Development Council, at its meeting of 18 May 1998, had noted that there was no prospect of the Council lifting the sanctions imposed against Nigeria. At present, EU embargos and restrictions on relations with Nigeria are set out in two EU Common Positions.  However, the Council agreed <Col N="1326" /> in November 1997 that the EU would adopt further restrictive measures if elections failed to produce a return to democracy and the rule of law in Nigeria before 1 October 1998.  A group of experts is at present studying possible additional measures, in continuation of substantive discussions within the EU on its future relations with Nigeria.  In those discussions, the need to encourage and support progress under General Abubakar will be carefully balanced against a rigorous evaluation of the concrete progress achieved under his leadership.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also supportive of efforts in the broader international community to encourage General Abubakar to implement necessary political reform.  The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, is visiting Nigeria this week, in order to pursue with the new Nigerian leadership his ongoing efforts to promote the release of political prisoners; the commutation of the death sentences imposed on General Diya and others convicted of plotting to overthrow the Government; and a return to democratic rule in Nigeria.  The Secretary-General has said that he has been encouraged by his discussions so far with General Abubakar and by the initial steps which the latter has taken.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to support concerted international action aimed at achieving an early return to democratic government in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>The consistent position of the Government has been that permanent vehicle checkpoints in border areas should be removed as soon as possible and we have pursued this regularly with the British authorities within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>In response to recent inquiries within that framework, I am advised by the British authorities that, while road furniture remains in place at a number of posts, none are routinely used as vehicle checkpoints; these installations are principally used as patrol bases.  I am further advised by the British side that the need for all military installations is kept under constant review and, where possible, such installations are removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the British-Irish Agreement the British Government has committed itself to make progress towards the objective of as early a return as possible to normal security arrangements in Northern Ireland, and to publish an overall security strategy dealing, <Col N="1327" /><i>inter alia,</i> with the removal of security installations. The British Government is also committed to regular consultations with the Government on progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>In this context, I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to urge upon the British authorities the importance of the early removal of such installations, including those mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conflict between the Angolan armed forces and the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) must be seen in the context of the process of peace-building and national reconciliation which is under way in Angola.  This process is strongly supported by Ireland and our EU partners.  In the wider international community, Ireland has supported UN Security Council Resolutions which aim primarily at encouraging UNITA (Unia o Nacional para a Independe ncia Total de Angola) to meet its obligations under the Lusaka Protocol, which sets out steps for the implementation of the peace agreement of 1994 concluded between UNITA and the Government of Angola.  The Security Council has also urged the Government of Angola to avoid taking any action which might undermine the peace process and stressed the importance of strengthening the rule of law throughout the national territory.</P>
      <P>The Angolan Government has indicated its wish to engage in dialogue with Cabinda separatists, with a view to making progress on the political and military situation in the enclave.  It is to be hoped that a stabilisation of the overall situation in Angola would create the conditions which would permit such a dialogue to begin.</P>
      <P>With regard to anti-personnel landmines, Ireland's strong opposition to the use of these weapons was reflected in the leading role we played in the negotiations which culminated in the Ottawa Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction. The Government will continue to promote the effective implementation of the convention worldwide.  Ireland has made significant contributions to mine victim rehabilitation, demining, and mine awareness projects in Angola, one of the countries worst affected by anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> Finally, I wish to express the Government's deep regret at the death of the UN SecretaryGeneral's Special Representative in Angola, Maitre Alioune Blondin Beye, who died with five of his colleagues and two pilots in a plane crash last week.  The international community owes Maitre Beye a great debt for his unremitting work for peace in Angola.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated to the Irish insurance industry that, in the absence of a voluntary cost reduction programme, including a reduction in commission rates, legislation would be introduced to reduce these rates.  In response, the industry took steps to reduce administration costs and also concluded the non-life Commissions Agreement binding insurers to reduce and standardise insurance commission rates.  Despite these initiatives, in 1987 the Government, under the Programme for National Recovery, introduced a package of measures to improve the insurance cost environment. As a result of pressure from the EU Commission, in response to complaints from the Irish insurance broker representative bodies, that the non-life Commissions Agreement was in breach of Article 85 of the Treaty, the Irish Insurance Federation discontinued the agreement.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Act, 1989, contained in Part III provisions on the payment of commissions by insurers.  Section 37 gave the Minister power to require reduction in commissions.  The policy stance when implementing the section 37 provision was to ensure that the ceilings on commission rates for certain categories of insurances, which had been established by the non-life Commissions Agreement, should be maintained.  Following surveys undertaken by the Department, it appeared that certain insurers had offered commission rates above the norm and such commissions were, therefore, considered to be excessive under the terms of the section 37 provision. As a result, in 1989 the then Minister issued notices to these companies requiring them to pay no more in commissions, than the amount set out in the notices, for the classes of insurance specified. In accordance with section 37 of the Insurance Act, 1989, the contents of these notices were copied to all other non-life insurers operating in the market and they are similarly bound by their contents.</P>
      <P>Data regarding the estimated annual savings to insurance companies since 1989 is not available. It is considered, however, that the guidelines as set out in the section 37 notices have acted as an effective mechanism to prevent upward pressure on commission rates and consequent savings on insurance premiums in the classes of non-life insurance concerned.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House on Tuesday, 30 June 1998 to Question No. 1.</P>
      <P>In that reply I referred to Ireland's employment action plan, published and laid before this House only last April.  A key element of the plan is the commitment to maximise existing resources devoted to the long-term unemployed through enhanced co-operation between FÁS and the employment support services of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and through giving the local employment service an integral role in the national employment service. From my perspective, a priority is to get both FÁS and the LES working together in a complementary manner to ensure that the needs and interests of the unemployed, in particular the long-term unemployed, are best met.  The further expansion of the local employment service, to which there is a commitment in Partnership 2000, will take place in that context.</P>
      <P>While I am cognisant of the voluntarist ethos which is associated with the local employment service, I am equally cognisant of the rights and obligations that attach both to the State and to unemployed people, as recognised in Partnership 2000 in the matter of delivering labour market reintegration supports.  How best to reconcile these principles I would see being worked out in the context of the move towards greater co-operation and integration between the different strands of the employment services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the Government's employment action plan, agreed by the Government <Col N="1332" /> last April and subsequently published and laid before this House.  The employment action plan sets out the policy measures and steps being taken at national level to give effect to the objectives of the four pillars and the 19 guidelines in the Council Resolution of December 1997.</P>
    <P>The employment action plan indicated that the preventative strategy being implemented to give effect to the European employment guidelines on under 25s required an intervention for about 30,000 young persons per annum.  This figure is based on the age by duration analysis of the live register by the CSO.  Given the falling rate of youth unemployment, the actual figure is likely to be less.  The process will be modelled generally on the Youth Progression Programme introduced for 18 and 19 years olds in October 1996.</P>
    <P>The employment action plan is an integrated strategy.  It is most certainly not about displacing older categories of unemployed persons from training and scheme places.  In fact FÁS will shortly implement an action programme for long-term unemployed persons which will set targets for their increased participation in mainstream training.  The independent review of community employment currently being undertaken by Deloitte and Touche may also suggest a basis for further targetting within the programme to cater for the existing stock of long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The legal basis governing the rights and obligations of unemployed persons seeking work is set out in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regulations adopted by statutory instrument in May of this year.  My Department participated in the discussions to formulate the regulations and the guidelines for the deciding officers of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs who apply the regulations. I also understand these were discussed with the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  Both regulations and guidelines are in the public domain.  There is also an appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>The guidelines set out the reasonability assumptions and tests to be applied by the deciding officer, whose function is a statutorily independent one, and I refer the Deputy to these.  The introduction of the minimum wage will obviously impact on the reasonability test applied to pay by a deciding officer.</P>

      <P>Following extensive discussions on a joint British and French proposal for a European Union code of conduct, based on eight agreed common criteria, political agreement was reached on the text of the code at the General Affairs Council on 25 May.</P>
      <P>Ireland has long advocated the adoption of measures to ensure the effective implementation of the EU common criteria in line with our objective of the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and technologies for military use.  During the Irish Presidency in 1996 some initial elements of interpretation of particular criteria and some practical measures for application of the criteria for internal use by arms export licensing authorities were agreed.</P>
      <P>During the negotiations for the EU code of conduct, our primary objective was to ensure the codes credibility as a promoter of restraint and responsibility.  To be credible, the code needed to contain clear unequivocal language on human rights.  Throughout the process, Ireland advocated the strongest possible language on human rights consistent with the importance we place on human rights in our foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed, therefore, at the outcome in respect of the human rights criterion.  I had wanted to see a provision envisaging complete abstention from arms exports to countries where there have been serious violations of human <Col N="1335" /> rights but certain partners were not even able to accept the possibility of restraint in respect of such arms exports.</P>
    <P>While Ireland could have blocked adoption of the code on the grounds of this inadequacy, I took the view that even a limited step by the EU in this area is preferable to no step at all.  We will use the opportunities presented by the annual review mechanism in the code to continue our efforts to ensure responsible export control policies are put in place by all our partners in the EU and to press for the clearest possible language on human rights.</P>

      <P>El Salvador has been emerging from the legacy of the war which was brought to an end by the 1992 peace accords.  It is generally accepted that while there have been significant strides forward since the end of that conflict, more remains to be done to consolidate respect for human rights and due process.  Ireland and its EU partners wish to see further consolidation of the gains made since the end of the conflict and further progress made in the area of human rights and democratisation, including electoral reform.  A priority is to guarantee unrestricted access by all sectors of the population to civil, political and economic rights, and to strengthen the democratic institutions, particularly the Human Rights Ombudspersons Office and the mechanisms which deal with police discipline.</P>
      <P>The EU has in recent weeks underlined to the El Salvador authorities the importance of the independence of, and respect for, the Ombudspersons Office.  It will be important to bring an end to abuses of human rights by the security forces, and to the significant degree of impunity which exists in relation to human rights abuses and other crimes.  There is a continuing need for greater toleration of divergent political views and those who hold them, as well as for full respect and protection for those who are working to ensure greater respect for human rights in El Salvador. In this connection, a new penal code has been introduced which creates new offences such as torture and enforced disappearance.  It is understood that these crimes will not be subject to statutes of limitations.</P>

      <P>The reliability and efficiency of the passport service has been greatly improved in recent years and there are now no delays.  The Passport Offices in Cork and Dublin are committed to issuing passports within ten working days in response to properly completed applications <Col N="1337" /> presented either in person or through the Passport Express postal service.  Despite the continuing significant increase in demand for passports, by employing additional temporary clerical staff and working overtime during the busy summer months the two Passport Offices are continuing to meet this commitment.  About 90 per cent of all applications, including those sent in by the ordinary post, are dealt with within ten days.  The least urgent 10 per cent or so of applications are attended to within five weeks unless the applicants contact the Passport Offices and ask that their passports be issued earlier.  Every effort is made to facilitate people in genuine emergencies.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the resources available to the Passport Offices are sufficient to enable them to maintain a high quality service.  Staffing levels are constantly monitored and the feasibility of moving to a fully automated processing system is being examined.</P>

      <P>The hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea which broke out at the beginning of May are potentially disastrous for both countries, both in terms of human suffering and also economic development.  The EU has called on Ethiopia and Eritrea, most recently at the Cardiff European Council, to cease hostilities and enter into negotiations. It has confirmed its support for mediation efforts under way and offered to provide any material assistance that could help achieve a negotiated settlement.  Ireland is supporting a number of small projects through an Irish NGO in Eritrea.</P>

      <P>The Government of Rwanda continues to face a number of significant problems as it works towards reconciliation and reconstruction.  These include the destabilisation caused by violent clashes between the Rwandan armed forces and a hard core of Hutu insurgents in the north-west of Rwanda; the challenge of helping those who survived the genocide and of reintegrating over 1.4 million refugees who returned to Rwanda over the past two years from former Zaire and <Col N="1338" /> Tanzania; the need to rehabilitate the system of justice which was destroyed in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide, in order to deal with over 120,000 genocide suspects who are in detention; the reconstruction of the national economy; and the creation of democratic institutions representing both communities in Rwanda.</P>
      <P>Despite these difficult circumstances, the Rwandese authorities reported progress in several important respects, during recent contacts with the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr. Aldo Ajello.  The authorities indicated that, after four years of crisis management, the Government is now ready to look at creating the bases of a sustainable democratic culture for Rwanda.  They plan to publish proposals this summer on justice alternatives and on the extension of the demobilisation programme and a local democracy experiment.</P>
      <P>The stabilisation of the Great Lakes region remains a priority for Ireland and its European Union partners.  The EU Common Position on Rwanda, adopted on 30 March 1998, sets out the political principles on which the EU will base its future relations with Rwanda, with the aim of securing an end to conflict and recovery from genocide, the promotion through national reconciliation of a democratic process, the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and the promotion of economic prosperity.  To this end, the EU Special Envoy maintains close contact with the Rwandese authorities.  His efforts were recently supplemented by a visit to the region by a ministerial Troika.  In Kigali, the Troika assured the President and Vice-President of Rwanda of the EUs commitment to helping build a stable, prosperous and democratic Rwanda, in support of Rwandas own efforts.  The Troika also stressed the importance attached by the EU to the fundamental issues of democratisation, reconciliation and human rights.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 Ireland has given a total of £10.2 million to support emergency and rehabilitation assistance programmes in Rwanda.  Assistance is focused on meeting the basic needs of genocide survivors and returned refugees in the areas of shelter, health, education and food security. Human rights considerations and the strengthening of civil society form an integral part of Ireland's approach to assistance.  In addition, in order to break the cycle of violence and impunity experienced by Rwanda over a number of decades, it is crucial to rebuild and strengthen the system of justice.  Ireland, with other donors, has been working towards this objective through support for a number of initiatives, including removing material constraints to the administration of justice and the training of communal police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will continue to support efforts to assist the Government of Rwanda in its difficult task of building a peaceful, just and stable society. <Col N="1339" /></P>

      <P>The Government is following closely developments in Algeria.  Since my visit to Algiers last December we have been active in discussions on Algeria in multilateral fora and have also maintained close bilateral contacts with the Algerian authorities.</P>
      <P>The most recent spate of violence and tension in Algeria was sparked off by the violent murder of Lounes Matoub, a popular Berber singer and outspoken anti-government figure.  Matoub was a staunch anti-Islamist, a vociferous advocate of the Berber cause and a committed democrat who often targeted the authorities through his music. As a response to his killing, there were riots at the weekend in Tizi Ouzou, capital of the Berber-dominated north-eastern Kabylie region.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, this has been a familiar pattern of events ever since Algeria erupted in violence in early 1992, when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists appeared to have secured the greatest number of votes.  More than 65,000 people have been killed since then, and, although there has been some improvement in recent months, the killings have continued.</P>
      <P>In March at the annual session of the Commission of Human Rights in Geneva, Ireland which is a member of the commission strongly supported the tabling of a resolution by the EU on the situation in Algeria.  Although this was not agreed, the Presidency of the European Union made a statement to the commission criticising the failure of Algeria to co-operate with the Commission of Human Rights and to accept visits by UN Special Rapporteurs on extra-judicial executions and torture.</P>
      <P>The EU statement said:</P>
      <P>It is incumbent upon all Member States of the United Nations to co-operate fully and without conditions with the procedures and mechanisms of United Nations bodies.  Failure to do so calls our work here into question, and makes more difficult the implementation of our primary task: the promotion and protection of human rights throughout the world.  The EU itself takes this obligation very seriously, and acts accordingly in its relations with other Member States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement went on to say that; &ldquo;We cannot therefore remain silent when a United Nations Member State, despite best efforts offered in a spirit of friendship and co-operation, repeatedly <Col N="1340" /> refuses to co-operate with the special procedures of this Commission.&rdquo; The Algerian authorities reacted very negatively to this statement.</P>
    <P>At the Euro-Mediterranean meeting held in Palermo in early June I had a bilateral meeting with the Algerian Foreign Minister, Mr Attaf.  I emphasised the necessity to end the tragic situation in Algeria and the need for greater transparency. Mr Attaf outlined the steps his Government were taking to deal with the situation and agreed on the need for continued dialogue with the EU.  I will continue to monitor the situation facing the people of Algeria and to raise their plight both in international fora and in bilateral contacts.</P>

      <P>The Lomé IV Convention which provides a framework for relations between the European Union and 71 African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, countries expires in February 2000.  The European Union directives for the negotiations on a successor framework were agreed at the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 29 June.  Formal negotiations between the EU and ACP states will start on 30 September next.</P>
      <P>The directives, or mandate, agreed by all member states provide for a global accord to be negotiated between the EU and ACP countries by February 2000.  This framework agreement will set out the long-term objectives for economic partnership and agree the approach for their achievement.  Between the years 2000 and 2005 the union will offer to establish free trade areas with regional subgroups engaged in a regional integration process or with individual countries where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Ireland has actively participated in all stages of discussions of the mandate for the negotiation of a framework agreement since its presentation to Council in draft form in January this year.  I am confident that the mandate as agreed reflects the priorities and views that were advanced by Ireland during the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government considers it essential that partnership continue to be a fundamental principle for EU-ACP relations under the new framework. At the same time existing instruments for co-operation and trade arrangements have not succeeded in significantly strengthening economic performance or sustainable development in ACP countries.  In this respect, the radical and integrated approach to future economic, political and development co-operation with ACP countries outlined in the directives is welcome. <Col N="1341" /> The particular and compelling needs of least developed countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, need to be fully addressed under the new framework.  Provisions for deepened EU-ACP political co-operation will be a key element in the new accord.  The mandate emphasises the need for a political environment guaranteeing peace, security and stability, respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance as prerequisites for development.  It is proposed that these be essential elements of a new accord.  The Government fully supports these provisions.</P>
    <P>Strengthened regional integration among ACP countries will be a central element in the future arrangements given the divergences of economic and development interests among these countries. For this reason, the proposal for a broad framework agreement allied to regional agreements as presented in the mandate represents a practical way forward.</P>
    <P>The new trade arrangements must be WTO compatible and assist the integration of ACP countries into the global economy.  Ireland believes that the interests of least developed countries must be protected by maximising their access to the Union market and simplifying rules of origin for their exports.  The European Union has agreed to start a process by the year 2000 which by the year 2005 will allow duty free access for essentially all products from least developed countries building on the level of existing Lomé trade provisions.  Rules of origin, including cumulation provisions, will be simplified.</P>
    <P>For non-least developed countries which will not enter free trade agreements, the Union has agreed to take account of their interests during the review of the generalised system of preferences framework in 2004.  This is to be welcomed as is the commitment to examine all possibilities in order to provide these countries with a new framework for trade that is equivalent to their existing situation under the Lomé Convention and in conformity with WTO rules.</P>
    <P>In the area of development co-operation, the Government supports the proposals in the mandate for rationalisation and simplification of existing co-operation instruments.  The mandate proposes a grant and investment facility with the former dedicated to national and regional programmes and the latter focused on support for the private sector in ACP countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> It will be important to ensure the type of aid for each partner country is determined on the basis of specific circumstances and that any moves towards direct financial support are matched by assistance to build the capacity of host governments to manage such aid.  The mandate correctly stresses the importance of the role of civil society and non-governmental organisations in future co-operation.</P>
    <P>There are three guiding principles for co-operation strategies in the mandate.  The first is support for political and institutional reforms and helping build the capacities of the actors of the partnership.  Next is gender mainstreaming and gender equality and the third is sustainable management of the environment and natural resources.  These principles are consistent with our national development co-operation policy. The priority areas for future co-operation will be support for growth factors, development of the private sector, competitiveness and employment, support for social policies and for regional co-operation and integration.  The priority given in the mandate to efforts to eradicate poverty should provide a clear focus for future development assistance to ACP countries.</P>
    <P>The negotiations with the ACP countries must be conducted in a spirit of partnership and mutual respect.  It will be important the European Union is not seen as imposing its views on ACP countries and that the Union position is not perceived as overly prescriptive.  The possibility of associating or linking non-ACP least developed countries to a future accord also deserves further consideration.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work for an early and successful conclusion of the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.  With the completion of the single market in air transport, <Col N="1345" /> within the European economic area &mdash; EEA &mdash; airlines are free to provide air services on any route within the EEA without Government or EU control subject to the availability of slots.  The question of whether any EEA airline wishes to exercise such rights on any particular route is entirely a matter therefore for the commercial judgment of such airlines.  I am aware that Donegal Airport management are currently engaged in efforts to secure a new operator for the route in question.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the AD Little rail safety study commissioned by CIE which looked at the safety of jointed track and associated signalling systems and telecommunications.  In relation to the signalling equipment at Heuston Station, the study concluded that, while it is not currently unsafe, action would be required in the immediate future to replace this equipment.</P>
      <P>I met with the CIE board on 29 June last to obtain a briefing on the AD Little report and during that meeting I asked CIE to quickly prepare a detailed safety investment plan to address the safety issues identified in the report.  I propose to bring this plan to Government as soon as it is ready.  The AD Little report will also be considered by the independent consultants commissioned by my Department to examine all aspects of rail safety.  They are due to complete their work at the end of September and I intend to publish their report.</P>

      <P>The unions in Telecom Éireann are conducting a ballot of their members today on an employee share ownership Plan &mdash; ESOP &mdash; and I look forward to a positive outcome.  The next step will be to finalise the detailed documentation to give legal effect to the ESOP agreement which was reached with the union coalition in Telecom Éireann and to set up the necessary employee share ownership trust &mdash; ESOT.  It is expected to have this completed over the coming months. Some 9 per cent of shares in the company will be transferred to the ESOT, when established, from the outset on payment to the Exchequer of the agreed price.  This will involve £160 million being paid on transfer of the 9.9 per cent shares with the balance of £30 million being paid one year after the IPO date.  The agreement provides that this final payment will be reduced on a <i>pro rata</i> basis if the market value of the company is less than £2 billion at the time of the IPO but greater than £1.6 billion.  An additional 5 per cent will be transferred to the ESOT on a phased basis as plans for the transformation of the company are achieved and verified.</P>
      <P>The ESOT will be raising a £60 million commercial loan to part-fund the purchase of the 9.9 per cent stake.  No distribution of shares from this 9.9 per cent stake to individual employees will occur while such shares are encumbered by the loan but, thereafter, all such shares will be eligible for distribution.  The agreement also provides that, subject to certain limited exceptions, shares from the 5 per cent stake will be eligible for distribution to employees after not more than five years.  Distribution of shares from the trust to individuals will be by way of transfer through an approved profit sharing scheme, to be approved by the Revenue Commissioners, and will be subject to the rules of such schemes.</P>

    <P>My Department is currently engaged in the process of selecting financial and legal advisers to assist with next year's IPO for the sale of State shares in Telecom Éireann.  A notice seeking such advisers was placed in the Official Journal of the EU and in the national press in May.  It is expected that these advisers will be appointed by the end of this month.  When the advisers are appointed, I will give detailed consideration to the details of the IPO including such issues as the number of shares to be covered by the offer, its structure and its timing.  At this stage, it is anticipated the IPO will take place around mid 1999. <Col N="1347" /></P>

      <P>The individual in question was one of 14 candidates who competed recently by interview for promotion to sergeant for which there were four vacancies in the 2nd Infantry Battalion.  The individual in question was not among the candidates recommended by the interview board to fill the available vacancies.  The formal results of the competition were published on 26 June 1998 and on the same day the commanding officers of each of the commands from which there were applicants were informed of the results by post.  The commanding officers have now formally advised all unsuccessful candidates of the outcome of the competition.  If the individual considers that he has been wronged he may seek redress under section 114 of the Defence Act.</P>

      <P>The mission of the Army Equitation School, as assigned to it on its establishment in 1926, is to advertise the Irish non-thoroughbred horse.  The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years.  Through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad, it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.  The school has, down the years, provided horses and riders of the highest quality for Irish international show jumping teams and, while acknowledging the contribution of individual civilian riders, the Army riders have been a consistent feature of international teams over many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department continues to source high quality Irish bred horses for the Army Equitation School for competition at home and abroad and I intend to ensure that sufficient numbers of good quality horses continue to be acquired by the school in order to maintain the proud tradition of that establishment.  Funding for the Army Equitation School is provided from the national lottery. There is a total allocation of £550,000 available this year which includes a provision of £260,000 in respect of the purchase of horses. <Col N="1349" /> I have arranged that officials of my Department will meet with officials of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and other relevant Departments to explore the question of extra funding for the Army Equitation School, particularly in the context of the Sydney Olympic Games in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association &mdash; PDFORRA &mdash; and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers &mdash; RACO &mdash; and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved <Col N="1350" /> with the recent BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by PDFORRA under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  You will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>
      <P>I would like to add, however, that in addition to basic pay, a military service allowance is payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,101 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £40.28 per week &mdash; £2,101 per annum &mdash; with the exception of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.50 per week.  The allowance is paid irrespective of the actual hours worked.  In addition, all personnel posted to Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £45.13 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates.  The allowance is paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package &mdash; which was paid out in October 1996 &mdash; provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special <Col N="1352" /> beef premium scheme.  When all payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1996 EU special beef premium scheme are made a comparison will be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money is to be recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in the process of recovering overpayments from those farmers in the former category and this money is to be used to make outstanding payments to farmers in the latter category.  Obviously it is important that as much money as possible can be recovered before striking a rate for payment of additional top-ups. The person named had 12 more eligible animals under the 1996 special beef premium scheme and 15 additional suckler cow under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme.  He will, therefore, be entitled to further top-up payments on these animals. It is expected that payment of amounts due will commence before the end of July.  To date, the person named was paid BSE/agrimonetary top-up amounting to £412.05 on 15 suckler cows and £150.12 on 12 male animals under the 1997 schemes.  In addition, he was paid £118.11 on 15 suckler cows and 12 male animals under the second tranche of agrimonetary top-ups.</P>

      <P>The person named received his full entitlement of £7,710.81 under the 1997 special beef premium scheme.  He is not entitled to 1997 extensification premium as his stocking density exceeded the limit of 1,399 livestock units per hectare.  The person named applied on 43 animals under the 1997 cattle headage scheme.  At an inspection carried out on 23 July 1997, 26 cows were rejected as they were not suckling calves at inspection date as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The person named is not entitled to any grants under clause 29 of the terms and conditions governing this scheme, which states that where the rejected animals exceed 20 per cent of the eligible animals found, no grants are payable.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The document referred to was not part of the documentation relied upon by my Department in the court case.  I am satisfied that there was no impropriety involved and that alteration to the document was intended to ensure that the company in question did not lose its rights to a GATT licence because of a technical deficiency in the original application which had been received on time.  With regard to the indemnities, the Supreme Court has granted the company in question leave to claim general damages against my Department in relation to the implementation of the GATT import licensing arrangements.  The High Court has not yet heard a submission or ruled on this issue.  In view of this, the full extent of the liability of my Department in respect of this case cannot be established.  It is the intention of my Department to attempt to recover the cost of these damages from the meat processors involved when this issue is resolved.</P>

      <P>The European Community regulatory system for plant protection products, which in this <Col N="1355" /> country is operated by my Department's pesticide control service, restricts the application rates of pesticide products to the minimum effective dose rates.  The regulatory system is designed to ensure a very high level of protection for man, animals and the environment.  If plant protection products are used in accordance with the approved label instructions unacceptable residues will not occur in food produce, including fruit and vegetables, post harvest.  The pesticide control service operates an enforcement programme to ensure that the pesticides being placed on the market are packaged and labelled correctly and the national pesticide monitoring and enforcement programme to ensure that pesticide residues in food do not exceed the maximum residue limits established in statutory regulations.  In relation to the latter my Department published the 1997 annual report on pesticide residues in food last week, which indicated that results for Irish produce were very satisfactory.</P>

      <P>It is a condition of the scheme of early retirement from farming that an applicant must, on the date all the transfer documents are signed, stop all commercial farming activity definitively. The application in this case was lodged in the local Farm Development Office on 25 May 1997. However, subsequent to the application being lodged the applicant continued to engage in farming in that he maintained a herd number and had cattle tested.  Payment of the early retirement from farming pension could not commence until the herd number was cancelled and the cattle disposed <Col N="1357" /> of.

      <P>The possibility of damage to potato crops from frost is a feature of early crop production. While I am aware that producers in north County Dublin suffered frost damage to crops, I have no plans to introduce a compensation scheme for such losses.  The 1997 scheme which provided assistance for a small number of horticulture and other arable crop producers whose viability was in jeopardy was a special once-off scheme.</P>

      <Quest>if he will examine the situation of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 9 on State occupational pension who recently received a 1.5 per cent pay increase but lost money as he went over the PRSI exemption limit; if he will abolish PRSI on pensioners and introduce marginal relief which would avoid full PRSI on reaching the exemption limit; and if he will allow a pay increase to be assessed annually for pensioners which would mean a valid PRSI assessment on only one pay cheque per year.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As PRSI is not payable on occupational pensions, I assume the question refers to the levies.  The total income of medical card holders and recipients of social welfare survivor's and widow's pensions, lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit allowance is exempt from the levy.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum.  This has been increased each year since and now stands at £207 per week (£10,750 per annum) following the last budget.  The levies threshold was introduced in order to focus assistance towards those on low incomes.</P>
      <P>The effect in the particular case outlined is not general, but is confined to those within a particular income range &mdash; those around £10,600 &mdash; who receive a pay increase which brings them over the threshold of £10,750 per annum.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangement ensures that most pensioners on low and middle incomes are exempt from the levies.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I have no plans to fully exempt occupational pensions from the levies, nor to introduce the amendment suggested.  However, I can confirm that the general application of the levies, and in particular, the threshold for the levies, will continue to be reviewed annually in the context of the preparation of the budget.</P>

      <Quest>if he will initiate special investment measures to tackle the infrastructual needs of the Border region in view of the agreement achieved at the multi-party talks; if his attention has been drawn to the need to regenerate the economy of that region which has suffered immense damage since 1969; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government has consistently supported all initiatives aimed at promoting economic regeneration in the Border region.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Border region is already receiving special financial assistance under various programmes related to its special situation.  These programmes include the International Fund for Ireland, the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and the INTERREG programme.</P>
      <P>The International Fund for Ireland was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986 with the aim of promoting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The fund has received contributions from the European Union, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  The fund has already provided a total of £350 million in funding for a large number of projects.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, established by the European Union in 1995, is aimed at Northern Ireland and the Border counties. It involves total EU expenditure of approximately £320 million over four years.  At least 20 per cent of this funding is available for the six Border counties.</P>
      <P>The Joint Ireland/Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme, established under the Structural Funds, has approved EU funding for the Border counties over the six years 1994/99 of approximately IR£73 million.  The allocation to Northern Ireland was STG£53 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99 includes a commitment on the part of the Irish and the UK Governments to maximise co-operation on Northern Ireland. Doubtless, this commitment to co-operation will continue during the next round of funding.  With regard to the planning process for the post-1999 Structural Funds, I have written to all regional <Col N="1364" /> authorities seeking their proposals for investment in their regions, including their proposals for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say precisely what additional measures may result from the recent agreement. The Deputy can be assured, however, that the Government will be making all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Border region benefits from the additional supports that should now become available on foot of the agreement.</P>

      <P>As I have explained to the House on numerous occasions recently, the main difficulties being experienced in relation to delays in adoption assessment procedures relate to the Eastern Health Board area.  I am in touch with the board in this matter on an ongoing basis and as I outlined to the House two weeks ago, the waiting time for applicants is now down to approximately 12 months.  In addition, three new social workers have been assigned to the boards inter country adoption team which should further reduce the delays being experienced by those awaiting assessment.</P>
      <P>The assessment procedure being used by the boards in respect of couples adopting for the second time is an operational matter.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, <Col N="1366" /> 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66 to 79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.  The attached table sets out the income guidelines used by the health boards in the assessment of applications for medical cards.</P>
      <P>As part of Budget 1996, the then Government announced that &ldquo;persons who have been unemployed for at least one year shall retain their medical cards after entering employment.&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Persons on the live register for at least one year, who take up paid insurable employment, were deemed to meet the criteria for retaining their medical cards for three years.  The provision also covers participants on approved schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed, including back to work allowance (BTWA), community employment, Jobstart, Job Initiative, Partnership and Community Group Initiative and development courses such as Workplace and the vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS).  The purpose of the budget provision was to remove disincentives to labour force participation by long-term unemployed persons.</P>
      <P>In addition to this, the Minister for Finance announced in December 1997 a budget tax initiative to help the long-term unemployed.  Essentially the initiative, known as Job Assist, offers tax incentives to employers to employ persons, who are long-term unemployed, and to the latter to take up qualifying employment.  Participants are entitled to retain their medical cards for three years after entering a qualifying employment.</P>

      <P>The requirements for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the respite care mentioned by the Deputy, are set out in the Report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities &mdash; Towards an Independent Future &mdash; published in December 1996.  The voluntary organisations involved in providing these services were represented on the review group. The report distinguishes between respite care services provided in non-residential and residential settings for people with physical and sensory disabilities. The principal recommendations regarding the requirements for the development of these services are as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Non-residential services</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of an additional 100 whole-time-equivalent nurses to meet the needs of the increasing number of people with disabilities who can be cared for at home; the extension of the twilight nursing service to ensure uniform availability of the service throughout the country; the provision of an additional 1,600 places in day service <Col N="1369" /> facilities; the provision of £5 million, phased in over a three year period, for the development of personal assistance services; and an increase of 40, over the next five years, in the number of social workers providing support services to people with disabilities;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Residential services</i>
    </P>
    <P>The immediate provision of 200 dedicated respite places; the provision of appropriate respite facilities for children; the provision of an additional 100 residential places in dedicated facilities to be provided as soon as possible; and the provision of an additional 200 places for persons with long-term disabilities requiring constant nursing care.</P>
    <P>The additional funding made available by this Government &mdash; £10 million in 1997 and £8.4 million in 1998 &mdash; for the maintenance and development of services, including respite care, for people with physical and sensory disabilities represents a major step towards meeting the recommendations contained in the report <i>Towards an Independent Future.</i></P>
    <P>Two key recommendations in that report are the establishment of co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services within each health board and the setting up of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities.  The establishment of the co-ordinating committees, which will have a significant input into the formulation of policy, the prioritisation of expenditure and the setting up of the database, are crucial elements in the development of these services.  The co-ordinating committees have been established within each health board and, following the recent completion of a joint database pilot project in three health board areas, I will shortly be setting up a national database development committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, did not make specific provisions to allow payment of general or special damages on foot of a High Court award on appeal, or to allow access to the Reparation Fund to persons who are granted an award of general or special damages on appeal.  On the advice of the Attorney General, I have made regulations under section 13 of the Act to provide that awards of the High Court may now be paid from the special account set up under section 10 of the Act, and also to provide the aforementioned access to the Reparation Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> I have also made regulations under section 5(9)(a) of the Act to extend the period within which an appeal to the High Court must be made. In addition to the month already provided for, a claimant will have a period of one month from the date of the commencement of the Rules of Court in relation to appeals under the Act during which she or he may decide in writing either to accept or reject the award, or to appeal the award under section 5(15).</P>
    <P>In relation to the Rules of Court governing appeals under the hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, these are the responsibility of the Superior Courts Rules Committee.  Draft rules have been prepared by that committee, and I have forwarded to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a document containing the observations on the draft rules which have been submitted by the groups representing hepatitis C sufferers.  This document is now with the Superior Courts Rules Committee for its consideration.</P>
    <P>A number of cases are currently before the courts on appeal.  The President of the High Court has indicated that, in the absence of Rules of Court, he would adopt the draft rules if required to deal with any urgent appeal.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply to a previous question on this issue given on 16 June 1998.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the recruitment of nurses is primarily a matter for the individual employers.  Consequently, the data the Deputy requests regarding the number of vacant nursing posts is not immediately available to the Department. However, the Department is aware that difficulties in recruiting nurses are being experienced by the major acute hospitals and for specialist areas in particular.</P>
      <P>I have asked my officials to keep the overall issue of the availability of nurses under review and to examine with health service employers whether any special initiatives are required in relation to recruitment.  The Department plans to engage a nurse researcher in the coming months who will be specifically employed to research nursing manpower needs over the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The availability of nurses will also be examined in the context of the report of the Commission on Nursing &mdash; if it is the case that some of the tasks undertaken by nurses are inappropriate to nurses and can be undertaken by other grades of staff, as seems likely from the commission's interim <Col N="1371" /> report, issues relating to the availability of nurses must be viewed in that light.  It will be necessary to review this very valuable resource to ensure that nurses are not used inappropriately for non-nursing duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</P>
      <P>The current agreement in place with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is the latest in a series of agreements covering supply terms, conditions and the price of medicines to the health services.  This agreement governs the price to wholesalers &mdash; wholesale price &mdash; in respect of medicines reimbursed on all schemes and also medicines supplied to hospitals. Therefore, the wholesale price of a particular drug is the same for all the schemes.  As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 16 June 1998, the difference in the retail price occurs because of the retail mark-up, normally 50 per cent, which is applied by pharmacists in respect of private dispensing.  Under the community drug schemes, pharmacists and/or patients are refunded in respect of private dispensing which exceeds specified thresholds.</P>
      <P>The difference in mark-up between the GMS and community drug schemes has had no adverse impact on the availability of community pharmacies in disadvantaged areas.  On the contrary the supply of medicines on the GMS scheme through community pharmacies has encouraged the establishment of community pharmacies in such areas.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the recent announcement that the marketing of leaded petrol in Ireland is to be phased out by the year 2000.  Sales of unleaded petrol accounted for some 83 per cent of total petrol sales in April 1998 and are rising steadily.  Most cars from 1986 onwards are manufactured to run on unleaded petrol while many earlier models are capable of running on both leaded and unleaded petrol.  The majority of older engines are also capable of technical adjustment to run on unleaded petrol.  In addition, I am aware that commercial interests are currently investigating the possibilities of introducing lead substitute products, which are used in overseas markets, onto the Irish market.</P>
      <P>There have been widespread consultations this year with, <i>inter alia</i>, the oil industry and motoring interests.  I do not expect the phase out of leaded petrol by 2000 to have any impact on petrol prices.</P>
      <P>In relation to the introduction and operation of a system of car testing, I would point out that, as indicated in my reply to Question No. 15 on 11 June 1998, an EU-wide competitive tendering process is now under way in my Department with a view to selecting the contractor by autumn 1998.</P>

      <P>Information on the number of families receiving rent supplementation is a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The Economic and Social Research Institute's report entitled An Analysis of Social Housing Need &mdash; Report No. 168, December, 1995 &mdash; suggested that there was at most a 25 per cent overlap between the local authority housing list and the SWA rent supplement scheme.</P>

      <P>Detailed information on the total expenditure on rent supplements by the Eastern Health Board &mdash; EHB &mdash; under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is shown in the following tabular statement.  The EHB area covers Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  Statistics relating to Dublin alone are not available.  Information prior to 1994 is estimated and information for 1998 is only available to February 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the last few years.  This was mainly due to increases in rent levels rather than recipient numbers.  In July 1996, following the publication of the Housing Review Group Report, an interdepartmental committee was established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government to examine the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to the local authorities.  It comprises of representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Finance as well the Environment and <Col N="1377" /> Local Government.  I understand that the committee will report shortly.</P>

At the end of last January, free travel passes had been issued in respect of about 505,000 people at an annual cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>
      <P>Any changes which would involve additional expenditure would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Regional staff of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, have been aware for some time that an area of shoreline at Rinmore Point has been and continues to be used as a local source of shingle for building purposes.  Dúchas has been actively addressing this issue, and has been making every effort to identify those engaged in this activity &mdash; those thought to be involved have been written to by Dúchas and have been advised that this activity is not permissible.  Efforts to stop this material being removed will be maintained.  If the Deputy has any specific information or evidence concerning those involved I would be interested in receiving it from him.</P>
      <P>However, I have no evidence to suggest that those involved in the construction of the fish processing plant proposed for this area participated in the removal of shingle or other material from the protected habitats in this site.  Dúchas regional personnel have received assurances from the relevant contractors in this regard, and their inspection of the area where construction is taking place appeared to confirm this.</P>
      <P>Dúchas will of course be monitoring the area on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>The process of setting up special procedures for the renewal of identity cards for asylum seekers is almost complete. These procedures will involve the replacement on a phased basis of individual lD cards which will incorporate a digitised photograph and essential details about the holder.  The cards will incorporate new security features to minimise the risk of falsification.  Rather than bringing very large numbers of asylum seekers together on one or two days they will be photographed over the next six months in smaller groups this should ensure that asylum seekers will not have to undergo avoidable inconvenience when identity cards are next being issued.</P>
      <P>My Department has placed advertisements in all national newspapers and certain main provincial papers advising asylum seekers that the cards that were due to expire on 30 June 1998 are to be extended automatically and are now valid until 31 December 1998.  In addition, the Garda Commissioner, the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs, all health board offices, the Irish Refugee Council, UNHCR, banks and post offices have been informed of these procedures. Once the procedures are in place new replacement cards will be issued on a phased basis by 31 December 1998.</P>

      <P>Manifestly unfounded applications for refugee status have caused significant problems for many countries and are a matter of concern to UNHCR because they cause delay and difficulties for genuine applicants.  The Executive Committee of the UNHCR drew attention to the problem of manifestly unfounded or abusive applications for refugee status in its conclusion EXCOM No. 30 in 1983.  The committee considered that national procedures &ldquo;may usefully include special provisions for dealing in an expeditious manner with applications which are considered to be so obviously without foundation as not to merit full examination .&rdquo;. EC Ministers also passed a resolution on the subject in 1992.</P>
      <P>The current procedures for processing asylum claims of 10 December 1997, as amended on 13 March 1998 are taken directly from section 12 of the Refugee Act, 1996 and take into account the UNHCR conclusion and the EC Ministers' resolution on manifestly unfounded applications.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 204 together.</P>
      <P>A broad range of legislation which impacts on disability is at present being undertaken by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, was recently passed by the Oireachtas and has been signed into law.  This legislation will give people with disabilities the protection of the law for the first time in relation to access to employment and advancement within employment.  It is hoped it will contribute to a reduction in the unacceptably high rates of unemployment of people with disabilities generally and build an awareness of the prevalence of discrimination on grounds of disability in the workplace.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, with Government approval, to have an Equal Status Bill published later this year.  This Bill will outlaw discrimination on similar grounds as with the Employment Equality Act but outside of the workplace.</P>
      <P>The report of the establishment group, tasked <i>inter alia</i> with the preparation of detailed proposals for setting up a national disability authority and a disability support service is now to hand and will be submitted to Government soon for approval.  Following on this, I propose to bring a national disability authority establishment Bill before the Oireachtas at the earliest opportunity. The NDA is expected to play a critical role in the development and monitoring of services provided to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>It is in the context of this programme of legislative, institutional and services provision improvements for people with disabilities that I intend to consider the form which a disability Bill might take and whether it will be appropriate to bring forward proposals for a disability equality amendment to the constitution in preparation for a disability Bill.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to review the operation of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993; the prosecutions, if any, initiated under this legislation in each of the years from 1993 to date; and the outcome of these prosecutions.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Criminal Law <Col N="1390" /> (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, came into force in July 1993 its implementation has been the subject of review from time to time.</P>
      <P>I recently published a comprehensive discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.  My Department is receiving submissions on the paper from interested individuals, groups and organisations up to 28 August next.  All submissions will be taken fully into account in the formulation of any proposals for changes to the law which will ensue from the paper.</P>
      <P>Statistics in relation to offences under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, were first published as a specific category in the 1995 annual report of the Garda Síochána.  Statistics for offences under the Act for the period prior to that are not therefore readily available.  However, the 1994 annual report of the Garda Síochána does state that in 1994 proceedings were taken in respect of 15 non-indictable offences of prostitution and offences of living on earnings of prostitution and there were 14 convictions.  The 1995 annual report of the Garda Síochána states that in 1995 proceedings were taken in respect of 56 non-indictable offences under the 1993 Act and there were 42 convictions.  The 1996 annual report of the Garda Síochána states that in 1996 proceedings were taken in respect of 63 non-indictable offences under the Act and there were 45 convictions.  The 1995 and 1996 figures relate to all non-indictable offences under the 1993 Act. Statistics for 1997 will be available shortly in the 1997 annual report of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>With regard to indictable offences under the 1993 Act, it would not be possible to produce statistics for those offences without verifying the individual details in each case where prosecutions were taken.  This could only be achieved with a disproportionate expenditure of time and resources.</P>

The various procedures involved in processing an application for a certificate of naturalisation, coupled with the high number of applications being received, is resulting in applications taking up to 12 months or more to complete.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  With regard to the specific details supplied I wish to inform him that the person concerned was arrested by the Garda on 5 December 1997 and was charged with an offence under section 27(a) 1 of the Firearms Act, 1964.  The Garda authorities have informed me <Col N="1394" /> that he was not in possession of any false passports at the time of his arrest.</P>
      <P>With regard to the granting of bail the Deputy will appreciate that this is a matter entirely for the courts who are, under the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it is not open for me to comment in any way on the decision of the court. However, I understand that the person in question applied for bail at his appearance before the District Court on the day of his arrest.  The gardaí objected to the bail application and it was not granted by the court.  The defendant was remanded in custody until 10 December 1997.</P>
      <P>At this court appearance the District Court granted an application for bail and further remanded the case to 17 December 1997.  The defendant appeared before the court on this date but failed to appear on 11 February 1998, the date to which the case had been further remanded.</P>
      <P>A bench warrant was issued for his arrest.  The Garda are also in the process of applying to the court to have the bail estreated in this case.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 4 September 1996 that the scheme for investment-based naturalisation should be suspended pending the entry into force of a statutory scheme.  It was also decided that applications in hand under the scheme could be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 11 March 1997, the previous Government decided that 19 applications on hand at 4 September 1996 were to be regarded as cases where commitments had been made, and that they <Col N="1400" /> should be processed to finality, while 50 other cases were to be left over until legislation was in place.</P>
    <P>On 6 May 1997, despite the decision of 11 March, the previous Government decided that additional applications, four in all, should be accepted in respect of three companies.  On 21 May, the previous Government approved the substitution of an investor in one of these cases, in circumstances where the original investor had withdrawn his application.</P>
    <P>On 25 June 1997, the previous Government decided that a further application should be accepted in respect of a fourth company and approved the substitution of an application for investment in another company, again in circumstances where the original investor had withdrawn.</P>

      <P>There are, at present, two forms of therapeutic intervention available to all prisoners committed for sex offences within the prison system.  Both forms of treatment are aimed at enabling such offenders gain a measure of control over their offending behaviour.  Individual counselling from my Department's clinical psychology service and from the probation and welfare service is available in each institution, with the temporary exception of those in the Curragh <Col N="1401" /> place of detention where it will be provided at the earliest opportunity.  The second type of therapeutic intervention is an intensive offence-focused group work programme which is available only in Arbour Hill Prison at the moment. This programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete. The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies. All convicted sex offenders who are in custody, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are deemed suitable.  Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.</P>
      <P>I am keen to expand treatment programmes for sex offenders and, to this end, my Department is actively examining the possibility of increasing the number of group treatment places available by locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  In view of the specialised skills necessary to set up and run such a programme, however, it will take some time to put a new programme in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 228 together.</P>
      <P>The abuse of drugs within the prison system is confined largely to the committal institutions in the Dublin area.  The problem is most acute in Mountjoy Prison which, as the State's main committal prison, has a large daily throughput of prisoners, many of whom have long histories of drug abuse which they try to maintain while in custody. Most of the other prison institutions are relatively drug free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling into and use of illegal drugs in the prison system.  These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing.  It has been my policy to continue <Col N="1402" /> with these efforts to reduce the level of drugs in the prison system.</P>
    <P>Efforts to eliminate the supply of drugs coming into our prisons are not enough on their own.  The education, treatment and rehabilitation of drug addicted offenders is important and there are, accordingly, specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in place in all of our prisons.</P>
    <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prison system, is co-ordinated by the director of prison medical services.  The director liaises regularly with the health boards to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners which is equivalent to that available in the community. Developments in medical services for drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.</P>
    <P>Extensive treatment facilities are in place in Mountjoy Prison to address the drug abuse problem there.  During 1997, approximately 1,650 inmates benefited from the standard 14 day drug chemical detoxification programme operated under medical supervision in the prison.  In addition, about 130 inmates have been admitted to the Drug Treatment Unit which opened there in July 1996.  This facility is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.  The programme is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  In addition to those inmates admitted to the health care unit, methadone may be prescribed by the medical officer for offenders who are accommodated in the general prison population in Mountjoy Prison and indeed in any of the other institutions.</P>
    <P>It is policy to provide an equivalent standard of health care for prisoners to that available to other citizens, including, where medically indicated, methadone maintenance.  Methadone maintenance is provided to a limited number of prisoners at present but it has proven impossible, to date, to devote a secure area for the supervised provision of a methadone maintenance programme to all suitable prisoners.  This is as a result of overcrowding in the prison system in general and in Mountjoy Prison in particular where the need for such maintenance programmes is greatest.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to both the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today and to the health of the individual inmates who have the motivation to deal with their addiction. I accept that more work is needed to extend the range of drug treatment facilities in the prison system and my Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expansion of drug treatment options generally.  As I have indicated already, progress in this respect is constrained for the present by the serious limitations imposed by <Col N="1403" /> overcrowding in our committal prisons.  This constraint will be greatly lessened as the prison building programme proceeds.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, clause 2 (iii) of the PCW provided that claims for improvements in pay and conditions be addressed on a basis which would involve change in structures, work practices or other conditions of service.  Negotiations took place with the Prison Officers' Association under this clause and agreement on a package of measures was reached.  One of the issues which was agreed with the association was that rent allowance will be pensionable to members of the prison service serving on or after 1 January 1994.  1t was also agreed with the association that rent allowance will be reckonable for the purpose of calculating lump sums or death gratuity in the case of members who retired or died in service in the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993.  In such cases pension will only be adjusted to take account of rent allowance with effect from 1 January 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Making rent allowance pensionable has cost implications.  Clause 2 (iii) of the PCW put a ceiling on the overall cost of agreements.  A cut off date for the pensionability of rent allowance had, <Col N="1404" /> therefore, to be agreed upon.  The dates outlined above were agreed with the association.</P>
    <P>It is established practice that allowances, where they are made pensionable for the first time, are made pensionable only for employees serving on or after the effective date.  This has been consistent policy for all public service groups.</P>

The Deputy may have in mind the special arrangement whereby, following the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order coming into operation on 29 June 1997, persons arriving from the UK who were refused entry on statutory grounds and subsequently sought asylum had their cases considered and, where it was warranted, such persons were informed that their application should be pursued in the UK with the agreement of the authorities there.  These arrangements have been superseded by the Dublin Convention, which came into effect on 1 September 1997.  Persons refused leave to land under the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order 1997 who then apply for asylum are now dealt with in accordance with the convention's provisions, as they would be had they arrived from any other location.</P>

      <P>Under the Regional Technical College <Col N="1407" /> Act, 1992 and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, it is a function of an institute to provide such courses of study as its governing body considers appropriate, subject to the annual programme and budget approval process laid down in the Acts.  The question of introducing, modifying or terminating a specific course in an institute of technology arises in the context of academic planning and review in higher education institutions.  Any proposals for change or new developments are submitted through the academic council to the governing body of the institution concerned.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by Limerick institute of technology as follows:</P>
      <P>The College Diploma/Degree in Architectural Technology in Limerick Institute of Technology has been under review by the Institute authorities for well over a year.  Staff were fully aware that restructuring of the course in the best interest of the students and reflecting the future needs of the industry, was inevitable. Following discussions with Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland where full technician status recognition was confirmed for all those on the old syllabus, it was decided that a more broader based recognition was more appropriate for this course and in the best interests of the future students.  This information has been conveyed to all applicants in time, should they wish, to exercise their CAO change of mind options, a similar facility is open to students in respect of over a dozen other CAO courses also.</P>
      <P>The decision to extend the period of time to four years was taken after much consideration and discussion of the benefit to students of a year period of practical experience in approved placements.  This period of practical work placements has been extremely successful in the three other degree programmes in this Institute.</P>

      <P>The application from An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee for an all-Irish postprimary school proposed that the school should operate on a site adjacent to Scoil Neasáin in Artane.  The suitability of this site, even as a very temporary location for an educational facility, was in question because of its very small size.  There is a significant amount of surplus accommodation in postprimary schools in the north-east of Dublin and, in the circumstances, it was essential that the possibility of using existing accommodation for an all-Irish postprimary facility should be fully explored before any other option was considered.</P>
      <P>In this regard meetings have been ongoing during the year between officials of my Department and representatives of An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin VEC.  At the meeting held on Wednesday, 3 June, it was made known to An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin VEC that my Department had no difficulty in approving, in principle, the provision of a school but that there appeared to be practical difficulties with regard to the site and suitable accommodation.  My Department will review the suitability of the proposed site.  It is now accepted that it will not be possible to make suitable arrangements for second level education through Irish in Dublin north-east for the coming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, An Fochoiste Meánoideachais and City of Dublin VEC will continue to work towards a solution to the problem.  It is my <Col N="1409" /> earnest intention to seek a satisfactory outcome on this question before the start of the 1999 school year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Question No. 382, on 23 June 1998, in which I stated that I would review the criteria for recognition and recourcing of new primary schools in the light of the report and recommendations of the Commission on School Accommodation Needs.  This would include any demand for non-denominational schools.  There are no such schools at present.</P>
      <P>The school referred to in my reply to Dáil Question No. 381, also on 23 June, is a multi-denominational school.</P>
      <P>The question of State ownership of new primary schools is still the subject of ongoing discussions with the Minister for Finance.  In these discussions I am drawing on the work of the commission. When these discussions have been completed and the commission has made its final report, which is expected later this year, I will then be in a position to consider the longer-term accommodation needs of all primary schools, requiring new school buildings.</P>
      <P>I should also mention that, generally, the provisions of section 10 of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, allows for the Minister to recognise new primary schools, having regard to the desirability of the diversity in the classes of schools operating in an area.</P>
      <P>The Education Bill, 1997, affords full recognition to multi-denominational schools along with schools under other forms of patronage.</P>

The composition of the steering group is given in the attached statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> The commission was established in March 1996 and the first task undertaken was the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  The final report on this matter was concluded at the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>Task two related to the question of the criteria for the recognition of new primary schools.  The technical working group published its report at the end of January 1998.  The full steering group met on six occasions and the working group, volunteered from the steering group, on four occasions, in relation to task two.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive a report and recommendations from the steering group on task two later in the year.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to a request to tarmac the yard at the school to which the Deputy refers is that the request is still under consideration within my Department.  The original request was made in 1992 and was refused because the works were not considered to be of priority and also because the Department considered that the school management was not properly maintaining the existing tarmac.  The school management was advised of this in a letter.  As a result of further recent correspondence from the school, the case is being re-examined.  A revised cost estimate is awaited.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am firmly committed to maximising the opportunities for special needs children, including children with a mental handicap, to participate in both the mainstream and special education systems.</P>
      <P>Where special needs children are concerned, it is necessary to view each case on an individual basis.  For some children, the nature of the special need is such that they can function quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial teacher, a resource teacher or a visiting teacher.  For other children, placement in a special school or special class may be the more appropriate response.</P>
      <P>An additional 54 remedial teachers, 32 resource teachers and two visiting teachers, were allocated to the primary sector for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>Also for the current school year, the pupil teacher ratio for special schools and special classes catering for children with a mild mental handicap was reduced from 14:1 to 13:1.  For children with a moderate mental handicap, the pupil teacher ratio was reduced from 10:1 to 9:1.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium gives particular priority to this area through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for children with special learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area.  It is my intention to further enhance the supports provided to children with special needs, including children with a mental handicap, for the forthcoming school year.  I expect to be in position to make an announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I raised the possible effects of the pro <Col N="1415" /> posed changes to tuition fee arrangements with Mr. David Blunkett, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, at a meeting in London in December 1997.  The Secretary of State assured me that it was not the UK Government's intention to deter Irish students from coming to the UK and the new fee arrangements were designed to allow students to contribute fairly to the costs of their higher education.  As the Deputy is aware, the proposals in the UK involve the introduction of an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 depending on parental income, the continuation of free tuition for students from lower income families and the replacement of maintenance grants with student loans.</P>
      <P>It is understood that all EU students will be eligible for grant assistance from the UK authorities towards their tuition fees, subject to the same conditions including means testing, as will be applied to UK students and Irish students should apply for such assistance, as previously, to the appropriate UK local education authority.</P>
      <P>Irish students studying in the UK will continue to be eligible for maintenance grants, subject to the usual conditions, in respect of attendance at courses approved for the purposes of my Department's student support schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 253 and 255 together.</P>
      <P>I announced on 18 July 1997 that my objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
      <P>Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority, was established as an interim authority on 18 September 1995 and has worked closely and in consultation with the partners in the education and training sectors since that time.  Teastas reported on an interim basis in January 1997 and issued its second report in January 1998.  I also held a Forum on the Development of a National Qualifications Framework on 13 February 1998 at which the technological sector of higher education was represented and played an active role.</P>
      <P>I aim to publish legislation in the coming months which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector and enhance its contribution to national and regional development.  It is the intention that the development of this legislation for the technological sector will form part of the broad single piece of legislation for the development of a national qualifications framework.</P>
      <P>Funding in respect of the Dublin Institute of Technology and other institutes of technology is currently made from Vote 29 &mdash; Third Level and Further Education and there is no proposal to change this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, in June 1997, agreed to the appointment of a body to advise the Higher Education Authority on whether the Dublin Institute <Col N="1417" /> of Technology should be established as a university. The report of the review body along with the recommendations of the Higher Education Authority will be considered by my Department when they become available.</P>
    <P>There are no plans for any further reviews under section 9 of the Universities Act, 1997, in relation to the establishment of universities.</P>
    <P>The interim review group, chaired by Professor Donnelly, is continuing its work.  In advising me on which institutes of technology should have the delegated authority, within a national qualifications framework, to award qualifications, the interim review group is processing applications from institutions which seek or have sought such delegation.  The review process is under way in relation to Waterford Institute of Technology and Cork Institute of Technology.</P>

      <P>Irish primary school teachers are class teachers as distinct from individual subject teachers and must therefore be qualified to teach all aspects of the curriculum.  Therefore, all teachers seeking recognition must achieve a standard of competence in the Irish language.  This competence can be achieved by undergoing and passing the Irish qualifications examination &ldquo;An Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge&rdquo;, both written and oral, or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>Teachers with the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full time course in the Association Montessori Internationale College in Milltown, Dublin are, however, recognised by my Department as qualified to teach in special schools for the mentally handicapped, the emotionally disturbed, and the hearing impaired.</P>
      <P>In addition, the recent National Forum on Early Childhood Education considered all aspects of this issue, including the Montessori method. An independent report on the forum is being prepared by the Independent Secretariat and will be published under the authority of the secretary general to the forum.  This report will be an important document, and will form an important input into a White Paper on early childhood education which I intend to publish later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of this process by commenting at this <Col N="1419" /> stage on possible future roles for Montessori teachers.</P>

      <P>Special classes for children with specific speech and language disorders are established where a need has been identified and supported by up-to-date psychological and speech therapy reports in respect of the children in question.  There are currently three special classes for specific speech and language disorder in the Dublin 24 area.  Two of these classes are in St Marks junior national school, Springfield, Tallaght and one in Scoil Ard Mhuire, Belgard, Tallaght.  My Department is currently investigating the establishment of a second class for children with a speech and language disorder in Scoil Ard Mhuire, Tallaght.</P>
      <P>The establishment of such a class will require the availability of a speech therapy service from the Eastern Health Board.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1998, for the first time the Government has provided substantial dedicated funding for the funding of research and development through the Department of Education and Science.  The new allocation of £5 million has been included in the 1998 Estimates for the Department of Education and Science for recurrent funding of research and development projects.  This funding is to be made available for research and development in the humanities, the social sciences and science and technology.</P>
      <P>On 26 May l998 and 11 June 1998, arrangements were announced for the programme of scientific and technological research in third level institutions.  The programme, to be administered through the Higher Education Authority, is as follows.  A sum of £3.5 million will be set aside for science and technology proposals which demonstrate a link with the strategic development of the institution from which they come.  This is the core of the programme and will involve putting in place a system of competitive bidding between third level institutions for submitted research programmes based on, and consistent with, the stated research policies and strategies of the individual institutions.  There will be a £0.5 million allocation for studentships in science and technology.  This will involve direct support for doctoral and postdoctoral students, administered through the same competitive bidding process.  A sum of £0.5 million will enable the Higher Education Authority to fund projects approved by the national research support fund board during 1998.  The remaining £0.5 million is for scholarships for research in the humanities and social sciences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This funding is supplementary to the existing sources of funding for research and development, including the various teaching and research budges of the higher education institutions, <Col N="1423" /> including various schemes administered by, or on behalf of, the Office for Science and Technology at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>

      <P>The current position is that all post-primary schools in County Cavan are assigned to one of the psychologists employed by my Department. The psychologist engages in case work as the resources of time and personnel permit. There is at present no psychologist from my Department working in primary schools in the area.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the need for schools to have ready access to a psychological service.  I intend therefore to establish a national educational psychological service which will be available to all primary and secondary schools as well as to pre-school children.  Plans for this service are included in the programme for Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the planning group for this service is now nearing completion and it is expected that it will report to me in the very near future. It is examining the current availability of psychological services to children and young people, and will make recommendations as to the developments which will be necessary to ensure effective provision in all schools, including those in County Cavan. <Col N="1424" /></P>

      <P>There are currently two classes for children with specific learning disability in St. Oliver Plunkett National School, Malahide.  However, I understand both classes are full for the coming school year.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently sanctioned the establishment of a special class for children with specific learning disability in Scoil Naomh Colmcille, Newbrook Road, Donaghmede.  A proposal to establish a further special class to cater for such children in the North County Dublin area is under active consideration in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department's inspectorate to take the needs of the child referred to by the Deputy into consideration in the context of the special class developments taking place in North County Dublin.</P>
