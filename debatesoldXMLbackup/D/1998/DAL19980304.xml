      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 42a, Finance Bill, 1998, Financial Resolutions; No. 3, Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998, Second Stage (resumed); No. 4, Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 42a.  shall be taken without debate.  Private Members' business shall be No. 77, Motion reHomelessness (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have received rafts of amendments in recent days; two amendments received yesterday are 66 pages in length.  I am not saying the current Minister for Finance is the first to do this, but it makes a farce of Committee Stage attempts to deal with technical legislation when we received even more amendments this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, this happens annually.  A number of days are allotted for Committee and Report Stages to deal with the Bill.  I know late amendments create great difficulties for those dealing with the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are difficulties in dealing adequately with technical amendments which arrive late.  We can make political points in committee, but it is impossible for us to give the Bill the technical scrutiny it requires.  Will the Taoiseach allow extra time on Report Stage?  If we miss something we will then have the interval between Committee and Report Stage to return to it.  We will not have sufficient time as things stand on Report Stage to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks made although I appreciate the Government's position. It would be helpful if the House could reconvene in committee on Report Stage to consider late amendments.  That would facilitate the passage of the Bill as well as its scrutiny by the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This can be discussed at the Whips' meeting but there are dates for the conclusion of the Finance Bill to be reached. However, I am sure those dealing with the Bill will be able to reach agreement, as there is usually a small number of Deputies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the Institute of Taxation in Ireland, which is concerned with implementing this legislation, has also expressed great concern about late amendments and their inability to make technical submissions on same?  The result of this is legislation which is not as good as it ought to be.</P>
      <P>In addition to the request for extra time on Report Stage, will the Taoiseach ask the Department of Finance to produce the Finance Bill earlier? If necessary, we should consider amending the constitutional time limits for dealing with the Finance Bill so it can be scrutinised properly. When that constitutional provision was put in place the technical tax legislation we now deal with was not contemplated and the time limits are not conducive to producing good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's point about looking at this in the long term is valid.  As a former Minister for Finance, I note that those who complain about the lack of time are those who tend to generate amendments because of their ingenuity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably, but that is not quite the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  The Finance Bill has become very complex compared to even a decade ago and it is valid to look at this in the long term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach gave extensive answers on proposals to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  A referendum is also proposed on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Those referenda may both be in May, with the latter being held in late May according to the Taoiseach. What is the Taoiseach's best estimate of the date for publication of details of the proposed changes to Articles 2 and 3?  When will the House see those proposals, given the necessity for proper consideration of amendments of the Constitution, particularly Articles 2 and 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early to say when the overall agreement will be reached.  We are working to try to achieve that by Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if that is possible, but I hope it will be.  As I stated yesterday, as Easter falls in the middle of April and due to the 30 day rule it would be impossible to hold a referendum on 8 May.  That gives us adequate time for consultation. It has yet to be decided whether the referendum will take the form of one or two questions, <Col N="259" /> but as soon as we are making sufficient progress I will consult the party leaders in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of whether the Taoiseach's target of Easter is achieved, it is worthwhile having that target.  If an agreement is reached by Easter can I assume amendments to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution will be published almost immediately thereafter in the form of a Bill, in other words, in the second half of April?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for what he put on the record of the House yesterday, but the complexities surrounding the exchanges we are now having is a clear indication that the Whips or Party leaders should be briefed on the timetable the Government envisages and, in particular, on the way the matter should be addressed. There is the added complication that the Government may be tempted to run two unrelated referendums on the same day, the referendum required to give approval to the Amsterdam Treaty and a referendum, which may take the form of one or two questions, on Articles 2 and 3.  While it is appropriate to raise this matter on the Order of Business a more constructive and comprehensive discussion could take place between the party leaders who, without anticipating the position of other parties, broadly support the Government on both issues.  Therefore, will the Taoiseach consider holding, at an appropriate time, a consultation with the party leaders on the timetable for both referendums?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request.  I do not wish to be pessimistic or optimistic about the matter, but, to use the Deputy's words, we must wait for the appropriate time.  There is a great deal yet to be agreed.  We are near agreement on several issues, but it is not easy to pull it all together.  There are 12 or 13 groups involved, some of which want to concentrate on one issue and others who wish to concentrate on a range of issues.  As I explained yesterday, I am endeavouring to narrow down the areas of disagreement. It would be extremely optimistic to say we can do this but, in spite of the terrible murders last night, if one is not optimistic one will not get anywhere. We have to be optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On a separate but perhaps related matter, will the Taoiseach confirm that despite the callous and brutal murders in Northern Ireland last night, the Irish Government is determined to proceed these negotiations to a successful conclusion?  Does the Taoiseach agree with Seamus Mallon that those murders are an attack on the peace process and, in my view, attack the very basis of civilised living and give <Col N="260" /> the lie to those who claim, through the use of murder, to defend one side of the community or the other?  Last night was a classic example of the indiscriminate murder of people simply because of where they drink or worship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The brutal murders of Damien Trainor and Philip Allen last night from the so-called opposite sides of the divide and the bomb found yesterday in a hay barn are designed to derail the peace process, as people have been trying to do for years.  Unfortunately, as we are discussing these issues this morning people somewhere else are working out their next move.  That is the brutal reality of the matter.  As I continually state to the parties involved, the more threats, intimidations and attempts to ruin the peace process, the more those of us who believe in non violence and democracy should claim we are going to proceed.  If enough people hold that view &mdash; I believe 98 per cent do &mdash; we will finally win through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the comments of Deputy De Rossa and the Taoiseach in condemning these awful murders of a Protestant and a Catholic last night.  Their friendship across the religious divide symbolises hope and a common humanity shared by people of different political opinions and their lives, although brought to a premature end, are an example of friendship across the religious and political divide which is needed on this island, particularly in the North.  It probably best illustrates the warped sectarian and hateful approach of the killers that they slaughtered two people of different religions because they were probably seeking to make it impossible for such people to be friends.  That shows the depths of the evil with which we are dealing in sectarian killers like those who killed those two decent men last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports the two parties in Government in their effort and determination to pursue a democratic solution to this problem. It is tragic, rather than ironic, that in the bicentenary anniversary of the United Irishmen who sought, among other things, to replace the titles of catholic, protestant and dissenter with the common name &ldquo;United Irishmen&rdquo; that two people who possess the titles catholic and protestant and who were celebrating friendship were shot simply because of who they were.  They were not shot for an opinion they had uttered or for a stance they had taken, but simply for who they were and for what their friendship represented to those who are fearful of diversity and pluralism on this island.  I extend my sympathy to the families of the murdered and to the people of Poyntzpass, a town which held itself up as a model of good community relations.  This assembly on this part of the island should extend sympathy to all the people of that community.  I join the leaders of the Fine Gael Party and Democratic Left in urging the leader of our Government to pursue without <Col N="261" /> fear or favour a democratic solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy's remarks would have the support of all the Members, under Standing Orders the House cannot pass votes of sympathy for people who were not Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are numerous precedents of votes of sympathy and expressions of sympathy here for far lesser people.  Dermot Morgan had a special place in Irish political life.  He was probably the most foremost political satirist of our time.  No place was better illustrated to the public by Dermot Morgan than Dáil Éireann.  His contribution was stupendous and should not go unnoticed or unmentioned.  It is ironic that a man who had to go abroad to earn a livelihood often referred to the fact that his famous radio programme Scrap Saturday was shelved because of political pressure on RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved the Adjournment last evening I was making the observation that the common market, which was the vernacular Anglo Saxon phrase to describe the European Economic Community, had transformed itself from being truly primarily an economic association to being truly a social community.  Much of the problem that the Euro sceptics, not just here but in the United Kingdom, have with regard to the relentless progress that has been made towards an ever closer union of the European people is that they regard a market, such as the common market, as simply that and no more.  A community, such as the one we are in the process <Col N="262" /> of slowly but relentlessly constructing, is a much wider and deeper thing.  It contains values and aspires to address issues which markets, by their nature, neither aspire to nor are capable of addressing or resolving.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the way in which this debate will be conducted between now and whenever the referendum is held and the manner in which this House will communicate, to a largely indifferent public, the momentous nature of the project in which we are engaged.  The press gallery is empty. The young people who now occupy the Visitors' Gallery and who have not yet sat the junior certificate will be trading and earning their salary in a currency yet to come into existence, the euro. By the time they are 25 years of age the European Union will have 20 member states; the Republic, with a population of just 3.5 million, will be part of a Union of 500 million people and the constitutional and legal structure of what I describe as a post-federal Europe is slowly but surely being put in place.  If the young people in the gallery are to take away one memory of their visit to Leinster House &mdash; and for some it is the only time they will come here &mdash; they should recognise they were here at a time when another important brick in the reconstruction of Europe was put in place by elected democrats in this Assembly on the same day in the aftermath of the murder, by Nazis and Fascists of Northern Ireland, of people who were simply going about their business.</P>
      <P>Europe is being reconstructed by democrats to ensure that future generations of young people, from whatever country in Europe, never again go to war.  If somebody thinks World War II and European nationalism and the devastation and havoc it has brought about is something we watch on television in romantic black and white war movies they have only to look at what is happening in part of Europe, Serbia, where rampant nationalism is causing the deaths of people. Across central Europe problems of nationalism and tensions associated with Europe's failure to resolve national conflict can be found in Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty, and it will never win a prize for being the most elegantly written, is building upon the foundations put in place by the European Coal and Steel Treaty, the Treaty of Rome, the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.  There are those who say this is the wrong way to construct a new Europe, that this is a messy way to put complicated and obscure structures in place, whose comprehension, even to the specialist, is extremely difficult to realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Europe did not start its construction with a cleared site.  Comparisons with that of the United States, where the indigenous peoples were effectively cleared away by the settling Europeans, presented themselves with a <i>tabula rase</i> upon which the 13 founding states, which became the United States, were able to construct a remarkable Constitution which has stood the test of time.  To use an analogy from a previous profession, <Col N="263" /> architecture, the <i>tabula rasa</i> presented to the constructors of the new European Constitution was the devastated landscape of Europe after the Second World War, not all of which was cleared and much of it had to be incorporated into a new construction.  The edifice of post-federal Europe, which we are in the process of constructing, must, for political reality, include elements of previous structures and components that relate to the political culture of the various parts that make up the European Union.  Nothing could be a better illustration of the difficulties surrounding the architects of the new Europe than the difficulties in the second and third pillars of this Treaty.</P>
    <P>The first pillar relates to the clear linear structure of the Treaty of Rome, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament on the one hand and the Commission on the other and the role of the courts in Luxembourg as a mechanism for dispute resolution.  This is truly a community in construction, moving relentlessly to a post-federal constitutional structure, that will become the hallmark for such regional groupings of sovereign states in the middle of the next century.  The timidity with which issues relating to policing, justice, immigration and related matters have been addressed by Justice Ministers from all countries is reflected in the intergovernmental nature of those deliberations and the failure to incorporate those elements of European concern into the main framework of the Treaty structure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the limited but necessary transfer of some elements of the justice and home affairs provisions into the main structure of the European Treaty on two counts.  I welcome it, as an Irish member of this Assembly, where we will see the transfer of powers to super European institutions and as a European democrat on the basis that the behaviour of some of the activities covered by the treaty provisions will be accountable, however limited that form of accountability may be, to the courts in Luxembourg and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>If we wish to proceed down the road of a European construction, to which I am committed, we will have to be courageous and effectively transfer more sovereign powers in the areas of justice and home affairs and a common foreign and security policy, to democratically accountable institutions on the European platform.  In time that means the common European foreign policy and its related security policy will be implemented in a coherent manner, which tragically did not happen in regard to the break-up of former Yugoslavia, and will be accountable in a democratic manner to the European Parliament and to the national parliaments of the 15 member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>There is a communication problem in explaining to the electorate what it is we are trying to achieve.  To date, because of our economic status and relative underdevelopment compared to the rest of northern Europe, we have been in <Col N="264" /> receipt of substantial transfers from the Structural Fund, the Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and under the mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Before the students in the Visitors' Gallery complete their leaving certificate examinations and enter the world of work we will no longer qualify for such transfers.  The current round will come to an end in 1999.  I hope satisfactory transitional arrangements will be made &mdash; the Government will have our full support in this respect &mdash; covering the duration of the next tranche of funds which is expected to be of the order of five to seven years, depending on the <i>realpolitik</i> of the day.  Within eight years, certainly no later than 2010, by virtue of our economic development and because of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, this country will be a net contributor to a union which will then have at least six additional members giving a total of 21 member states with a total population of the order of 500 million.</P>
    <P>It is the public's perception that it is good for Ireland to be a member of the European Union because we are takers rather than givers.  We receive money from the taxpayers of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland and we are not expected to give much in return.  We have, collectively, achieved success.  That gives cause for celebration.  The figures Deputy Gay Mitchell quoted were extraordinary.  They show that we have moved from a position where <i>per capita</i> income was 50 per cent of the European average when we joined the European Union on 1 January 1973 to the point where it is now in line with the European average.  In many respects, our quality of life and standard of living based on such indicators as the rate of home ownership are higher than those of many citizens in what would be described nominally as the richer countries.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is vigorously committed to pursuing the idea that Ireland has a contribution to make to the European Union which has an important contribution to make to world affairs in the next century.  Ireland, as a small neutral country which finally gained independence after the War of Independence and the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1922, with countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Finland and Slovenia which gained independence in the past four or five years, as distinct from the big imperial powers, has to make a positive contribution.  This treaty will go some of the way towards redistributing wealth to tackle the problem of poverty within Europe because of the competences granted by its provisions, including the chapter on employment.  However, we have to ensure the new post-federal Europe which is rapidly being constructed does not take on the attributes, arrogance and assertions that characterised the French, the Germans and the British in their heyday when they thought they could write a French, German or British agenda that best served their economic or geopolitical interests.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is no provision for Ireland's participation in a military or defence <Col N="265" /> alliance without the express consent of the people in a referendum.  In the post-Cold War period, the role of neutral countries such as Ireland, Austria, Finland and Sweden and of countries which have a policy of non-aggression such as Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium all of which were neutral at the start of the Second World War and invaded by their neighbours, has to be stated clearly in the legal statutes in a post-federal Europe to which we must make a positive contribution. Concern about what is contained in the treaty is increasingly being expressed by people outside the House who do not share the consensus celebrated inside it.  This concern is being distorted and misrepresented.</P>
    <P>A number of key issues that we thought would be addressed in the Treaty were not dealt with in the negotiations in Amsterdam.  They include the concept of one commissioner per country with Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Italy having two commissioners and the issue of qualified majority voting.  Instead of reacting passively to proposals from other member states or groups of member states in the construction of a post-federal Europe and trying to defend what is euphemistically described as the Irish interest but which really means protecting the income stream of Structural and other funds to which I have referred, we should start to actively, progressively and positively propose structures that would give shape to a humane, socially progressive post-federal Europe.  The Amsterdam Treaty is a small but significant step in that direction.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the manner in which the White Paper has been drafted.  I am concerned that the debate on this issue will not take place in the context of a referendum to change Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Now that we are facing a different Europe in which Ireland will have a changed role because of its economic success we have to move from a position where we respond passively to proposals relating to the European project to the point where we react positively and seek with other small member states to dictate the future we want for ourselves, our children and grandchildren.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell referred to the trauma of war being the godfather of the European project and spoke movingly of Helmet Kohl's family as a symbol of that experience.  The future of Europe and its security will depend critically on the role small nation States play in its construction.  We are all familiar with the stone wall boundaries of fields.  Anyone who looks at their construction, whether in County Down, Connemara or County Wicklow, will note that while the big stones provide the cover and structure, the small stones and the little ones wedged in between the big stones provide the stability necessary to ensure the edifice does not fall.  That is an honourable role for small States to play in the future construction of a post federal Europe.  It is the role we must actively take on and communicate, with enthusiasm, to our fellow citizens when we ask them, as my party will, to vote in favour of this Treaty, <Col N="266" /> bearing in mind that the safeguards in regard to the exercise of options contained in the complexity of the Treaty have been doubly stitched into the amendment.  First, their application is ringfenced to certain prescribed articles set out in the Minister's speech and, second, before any Administration or Government wishes to exercise any of the options contained in those provisions or Articles it must get the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the legislation to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty.  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement last night setting out the Government's position on this important referendum. I was elected to the Dáil 25 years ago, around the same time Ireland joined the European Community, and my presence here has coincided with Ireland's membership of it.  I have seen the major developments that have taken place since we joined it.  I pay tribute to the politicians, diplomats and officials who in those early nervous days of our membership played an outstanding role in advancing Ireland's position in the Community.  I also pay tribute to members of this Parliament who represented Ireland in the European Community at that time.  We owe a great debt of gratitude to Dr. Patrick Hillery, our first Commissioner, and to the many officials and negotiators who dealt with many of the complex issues at that time.  Ireland has benefited enormously from membership of the European Community. A close inspection of any sector will reveal the beneficial impact of Community membership on our economy, family and social affairs and the political sphere over the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is the nuts and bolts of the Community.  As the previous speaker said, it is its keystone.  It builds on the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the Single European Act, 1985, and the Maastricht Treaty, 1991.  It further underpins the work of the European Community and offers the prospect of development and enlargement in the years ahead.  A few areas of our economy have greatly benefited from our membership.  I recall the depression in the agricultural industry when I was elected to this House 25 years ago.  Agricultural prices were falling, calves were sold in cattle marts for £1 and industry was in crisis.  The Common Agricultural Policy has been the key focal point of agricultural development over the past 25 years.  It ensured our agricultural industry not only offered the prospect of security but provided the great possibilities for expansion and development we have seen in the past 25 years.  There has been a transformation in our agricultural industry mainly because of the support of the Common Agricultural Policy, FEOGA funding, marketing funds, research funding and the various incentives, such as Leader programmes, which were available to encourage people to stay on the land and to engage in successful agricultural enterprises.  I pay tribute to those who negotiated on our behalf and to the representatives of farming organisations, many of whom were involved <Col N="267" /> in the European farming lobby.  They put forward farmers' views, with successful results.</P>
    <P>When we joined the Community our fishing industry was fragile.  It was barely able to cope because of job losses and a serious erosion of fishermen's incomes.  Even though there was strong criticism of the way the Common Fisheries Policy was negotiated, the end result offered the prospect of security to the industry.  Through FEOGA funding and grant aid, it offered not only direct support to fishermen in respect of fish prices and quotas, but also support in marketing, development of harbours and other necessary infrastructure to help the industry thrive and prosper.  Even though there may be some criticism of the level of activity in the fishing industry any objective assessment of our fishing industry since we joined the Community would reveal it is stronger than it has ever been.  The prospects for employment are better than they were on our entry to it and the prospects in terms of income and job opportunities for those engaged in the industry are brighter and more secure today than before we joined the Community.  Through the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy we have seen the Community at work and its beneficial impact on the most remote coastal communities in the west, as in the case of the success of fishing harbours like Killybegs.  The success of the fishing industry in that area is an example of the success of our membership of the European Community.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the fishing industry also played a vital role in those early negotiations and in negotiations to date.  I single out the commitment of and contribution made by Joey Murrin to the development of the fishing industry.  Even though I did not see eye to eye with him on some issues when I was Minister, as a representative of the fishing community, he has seen the benefit of the Common Fisheries Policy and the necessity, as the Community enlarges and develops, to be vigilant in ensuring the Irish case is adequately made.  The agricultural and fishery organisations were not found wanting in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to single out the Community's valuable contribution towards the advancement of women in our society.  Many here may have forgotten the early days of our membership where equality legislation on equal pay and equal opportunities for women was advanced and supported by the Community.  We have seen far reaching advances in the social area in regard to women's issues.</P>
    <P>To a large extent, the momentum and drive for that came from within the Community and was very much part of its policies in the early days of our membership.</P>
    <P>The Community has also had an influential role to play in employment.  We are now enjoying unprecedented economic success and the prospects for jobs are better today than ever before. The long-term future of this economy is secure and stable.  I recall the difficulties with rising levels of unemployment in the early 1970s.  Many <Col N="268" /> Members will recall the difficulties we faced on joining the Community when the initial shock of membership shook out many industries and created much unemployment.</P>
    <P>We learned very quickly from Europe of the desirability of the unique position here between Government, employers and unions.  To some extent, we borrowed from the success of Europe in that regard.  The framework we set down to collectively deal with our employment, social and taxation problems &mdash; the partnership between Government, employers and unions, which was a tripartite arrangement fundamental to the economic stability of this country &mdash; has its roots in Europe.  We have gained significantly from our experiences in dealing with our partners in the European Union.  If we look back over the past 25 years of our membership, we will see that we have had outstanding success on social issues and on economic grounds in sectors of the economy which have had difficulties.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there are areas which need attention. I underline the need for continued vigilance, in relation to the development of the western coastal areas, in particular.  In a new and enlarging Community where there will be pressures on agricultural incomes and perhaps on fishermen and others, it is desirable that the funding we have received over the years from the Community continues to ensure that the imbalances in isolated rural areas, along the west coast, in particular, are rectified.</P>
    <P>In ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, we will underpin the work done over the past 25 years. We are setting the parameters of how the new Europe will evolve, develop and prosper over the next 25 years.  The objective of the Amsterdam Treaty to bring the citizen closer to the Community is laudable and must be supported.  The treaty contains provisions on unemployment and on the fight against drugs.  We have seen the escalation of the drug problem not only throughout Europe, but in our cities, towns and communities. The Amsterdam Treaty will give a further impetuous to the European Union drive to deal effectively with drug trafficking and the escalation of the drug problem and to come to grips with this ever increasing menace which threatens so many young people in the Community, especially in the most remote parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year there were suggestions that the European Union might take part in a coastal protection service to ensure the Irish coastline is protected from the menace of drug traffickers.  I direct the attention of Government to the need to work with the Community and to seek funding from it to establish a coastal protection service around our coastline to ensure that illicit or illegal trafficking in drugs is effectively dealt with.  In that regard, we can see the success we have had with the search and rescue service and fishery surveillance, for which we have received some financial support from the European Community.  It is necessary to get such a financial commitment at <Col N="269" /> European level to enable this problem to be effectively dealt with.</P>
    <P>Although I explained the significant impact membership of the Community has had in dealing with some of our problems over the past 25 years, all our problems have not been resolved.  The problems of poverty and social exclusion need to be dealt with and the Community can assist us greatly in helping to deal with those issues.  We can learn from the experiences in other countries in dealing with these problems but we can also find ways to obtain Community support to deal with our problems.  The elimination of poverty in this country and in the Community must always be foremost in our minds.  The issue of homelessness was debated in the House last night.  We cannot accept a situation where young people are sleeping on the streets of this city each night and there is an obligation on the Government, the corporation and on anyone involved in this area. The Community should support the provision of services and facilities to deal with this crisis in our city.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the strengthening of the Community and the Amsterdam Treaty will further stabilise the situation in relation to international affairs, especially European affairs.  I draw the House's attention to a recent document which came from the Council of Europe, at which I, and others here, represent Ireland.  It would be wise to study some of the recent documents emanating from the Council on developments in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the implications of what is taking place there on the Balkan area and the impact it may have across Europe.  The tensions in the former Yugoslavia &mdash; Kosova, Serbia and Montenegro may possibly be drawn into it &mdash; form a serious threat to the stability of those eastern European countries.</P>
    <P>The heads of the south eastern countries of Europe at a meeting held in Crete last year, which was the first in the history of those countries, sought support from the European Union and the international community to help them with the crisis they face and which could threaten the security and stability of Europe.  At a time of developing tensions in south eastern European countries, it is important that we, as a member of the Community, play our part in negotiations and in ensuring support for these delicate democracies is forthcoming, otherwise the powder keg might erupt and cause the type of death and destruction we have seen there in recent years.</P>
    <P>A resolution was passed at that meeting of the heads of Government to work together in a framework for peace and security and for good neighbourliness and stability in the counties of south eastern Europe.  They would like a contemporary European identity to be established which would have a major impact on international affairs.  We have an important role to play in that regard, as we have always had in our peacekeeping efforts in places like the Lebanon.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to a number of areas in which I, and perhaps the public, have <Col N="270" /> some fears which need to be addressed before the referendum.  There are fears in some sections of the community that monetary union may erode the value of savings and pensions.  It is therefore necessary in the debate on this Bill and on the treaty to give an assurance that savings and pensions will not be depleted or undermined by our participation in monetary union, especially during the changeover.  It is also necessary to clarify the matter for people who are worried about it.</P>
    <P>Although national radio did not have time to cover the Minister's contribution yesterday, it did make time available for a Danish Member of the European Parliament and a member of the Green Party to say why we should not accept the treaty. I find this extraordinary.  I have never heard members of the Green Party elected to the European Parliament say they are not satisfied with the way it conducts its business, nor have I ever heard them offer to resign their seats or leave the Parliament because they believe our neutrality or currency is jeopardised by membership.  It is time an end was put to this sort of hypocrisy.  I thought Brian Boru dealt with the Danes in 1014 but it seems they are returning.  I believe people will not be fooled by these newly found spokespersons from Denmark who come here to influence the electorate.  Voters are capable of making their own decisions and, on this occasion, they will decide to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty.  They will see the Union has played a central and dynamic role in every facet of Irish social and economic development in the 25 years since we joined.  I would like to see that continue for the next 25 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill and my party will be asking for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  We do so because the treaty takes the European Union closer to the kind of Europe to which we aspire.  It takes a small but significant step towards a more social and democratic Europe.  Amsterdam seeks to put the people of Europe, and not just the market, at the heart of the European project.  The Amsterdam Treaty places the European Union on democratic principles.  It strengthens the rights of workers, consumers and citizens, helps protect the environment, makes it easier for Europe to tackle organised crime, anticipates the enlargement of the Union and protects our positive neutrality.</P>
      <P>If the Amsterdam Treaty is open to criticism, it is that it does not go far enough and that it is tentative in areas of social policy.  There is still a long way to go in bringing the market under control and the treaty postpones institutional reform. It is moving slowly but definitely in the direction of a people's Europe.  As such, it should be supported, especially by those who criticised earlier European treaties as being too preoccupied with economics and not enough with people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union is the product of 50 years of effort.  It started out as a form of economic co-operation between previously warring states in <Col N="271" /> Europe with the hope that it would at least help prevent further war and lead in effect to a shared prosperity.  It has succeeded in both these objectives but it has gone beyond that.  Its development until the end of the Cold War was essentially based on economics.  However, in recent years since the end of the Cold War, it has developed a more overt political dimension and has taken on a more urgent momentum, driven especially by EMU and all that goes with it.  There is no doubt the European Union, with its single market, common currency, common political institutions, common foreign and security policy, its increasing body of common legislation and the European Court, is developing into a federal superstate, a United States of Europe, though not in precisely the same form as the more familiar USA.</P>
    <P>We are now part of a regional, continental form of government to which many aspects of our State or national sovereignty have been subordinated. Many regret the loss of sovereignty and argue for its complete restoration.  However, this is the end of the 20th century, not the 19th.  One hundred years ago, it was possible and preferable for people to seek to exercise democratic control through the nation state.  In the modern world, where economics, communications, transport, environment and other areas of life are global, it is almost impossible to exercise effective or adequate control through the nation state.  How can the sovereign nation state exercise control or restraint on global economic markets where wage levels in Taiwan can result in redundancies in Tralee?  How can the individual state exercise effective control or influence on behalf of its people on satellite television?  How does it stop pornography or libel on the Internet?  How can an individual state effectively protect its environment or the health of its people when nuclear radiation or global warming refuse to recognise national or state boundaries?  The issue for politics today is how we make people sovereign in the new information age.  How is the citizen or the individual to exercise any kind of control in the changing world?  How do we collectively assert the common good in a world where capital and material power are transnational?  Inevitably, it must be through the development of democratic, global and regional political institutions.</P>
    <P>As a socialist, I believe the market cannot adequately address the issues which face humanity, such as disease, poverty and environmental degradation.  The market produces great inequality.  It makes some very rich while leaving others very poor.  It ultimately produces a social and economic jungle, where strong animals like tigers, Celtic or otherwise, can thrive.  However, who wants to live in a jungle?  The market must be controlled and disciplined in the common good and in the interests of civilisation.  Given that so much of the market is now global and regional, our political institutions must follow suit.  The European Union may have begun and <Col N="272" /> may have been developed to serve the needs of capital, but it is also an institution which can and should be turned to the service of its people.  It may have started life as a political aid to the market. It can and should now be harnessed as a means by which people in this continent and in this region of the globe exercise some democratic control on the market.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty brought the European Union to its highest point as a servant of the market. It was a product of the neo-liberal thinking then in the ascendant in the post-Cold War Europe.  It intended to create the perfect capitalist market which was both deregulated and liberalised. It intended the European Union to be the new world superpower.  Maastricht was a victory for European toryism, although it is ironic that it was some of the British Tories who first spotted the red hand in the velvet glove.  If the political will exists, the same European Union can be turned to serve the needs of its population in ways not initially envisaged by some of its earlier enthusiasts.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty has begun that process. It has begun to take the rough free market edge off Maastricht.  First, it makes clear the European Union was founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  It defines the human rights standard as that of the European Convention.  It provides for enforcement of these principles through making them a condition of membership, through sanctions and through the European Court.  The inclusion of these principles in the treaty is our guarantee that the European Union in which our children and grandchildren will live will be democratic and will respect human rights.</P>
    <P>Second, the Amsterdam Treaty provides a range of new competencies for the union: to develop a common employment policy all member states will now subscribe to the social policy; there will be action on social exclusion; there will be new European standards for public health; better consumer protection; action to combat discrimination based on sex, race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation; the rights of churches and religious freedom will be guaranteed and environmental considerations are to be integrated into all areas of policy making. These are the areas which matter most to people. Previous treaties addressed the economy of Europe and freedom of capital, this treaty puts the emphasis on human freedoms and the rights of European citizens.</P>
    <P>While moving forward the process of European integration, the treaty also protects and enhances cultural integrity and diversity.  Under the treaty Irish citizens who wish to use the Irish language in official matters will have greater guaranteed language rights in the European institutions than in Ireland.  The protocol on broadcasting guarantees the principle of public service broadcasting and will be critical in the promotion of our cultural identity in the rapidly changing world of television and telecommunications.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> The principle of the free movement of people within the EU's boundaries is being established in the treaty.  I regret that because the UK will remain outside this arrangement, we must also remain outside to protect the common travel area with the UK.  I hope it will not be long before the UK decides to opt in.  If there is any delay in the UK opting in we should consider opting in independently as allowed by the treaty.  Increasingly, our point of reference is with the European mainland not with the UK.  If necessary we should go it alone into the Schengen arrangements, we should not wait for very long for the UK to do so.</P>
    <P>The changes in policing and judicial areas which go hand in hand with Schengen will greatly increase the EU's ability to deal with organised and transnational crime.  All over Europe people want effective action to tackle the drugs menace, to defeat terrorism and combat crime and I welcome the provisions in the treaty.  The treaty anticipates the enlargement of the union and postpones institutional reform until then.  This is a pity.  The citizens of Europe do not feel connected to the European political institutions.  There is a low turnout in European Parliament elections, the council operates in private and remains a mystery to the public and the Commission continues to be regarded, unfairly, as a large Euro-bureaucracy. Even amending the treaties does not excite public passion.  However, increasingly, it is in the European institutions that the critical decisions are being made which affect all our lives.  The big weakness in the European project is that the people are not actively engaged in it &mdash; they do not even understand it.  Institutional reform is not a numbers game which results from enlargement.  The reform and the relevance of Europe's political institutions is an imperative if the European project is to engage its citizens and be democratic.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played a positive and highly respected role in the development of the European project.  We should take the lead in promoting political and institutional reform within the EU.  Our Government should not wait until the next Intergovernmental Conference to advance proposals for political reform.  By advancing proposals for institutional reform now, we may place ourselves in the best position to ensure that the rights of small states are protected in any new arrangement.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the Amsterdam Treaty which is likely to cause most debate during the referendum concerns the common foreign and security policy and specifically the provisions relating to defence.  This is the area of the treaty which has produced most discussion within my party and there are understandable concerns about where the European Union is taking us on foreign, security and defence policy.  Democratic Left is committed to positive neutrality.  We oppose war, we support the peaceful resolution of conflict, we oppose the sale of arms and we demand disarmament. We are opposed to military blocs and to <Col N="274" /> Ireland becoming a member of a military bloc. Specifically, we are opposed to membership of NATO or the Western European Union. However, neutrality does not mean that we abstain or that we are indifferent to the security issues of our time.  Who can be indifferent to the slaughter of innocents in Algeria or the ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia?  Neutrality does not mean that as a country we stand aside from decisions and policies on security.  We have a role to play in Europe and the world which extends our neutrality and is active in the cause of peace, disarmament and solidarity.  The Amsterdam Treaty will allow us play that active role, while at the same time exempting us from any involvement in military pacts.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty committed the European Union to a common foreign and security policy and made it clear that security included defence.  Maastricht made the Western European Union an integral part of the EU and it declared the Union's intention to develop a common defence policy.  It acknowledged Ireland's neutrality but only in a way which permitted Ireland to stand aside while the rest of the Union made the decisions.  Amsterdam changes this arrangement. It reaffirms the common foreign and security policy and the intention to proceed to a common defence.  However, it provides a means whereby neutral countries like Ireland can fully participate in decision making while retaining our neutrality.  The treaty considerably strengthens the scope for Irish and neutral influence on European foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Common positions will have to be unanimously agreed.  The implementation of decisions does not commit Ireland to participation.  The &lsquo;constructive abstention&rsquo; mechanism provides a more refined mechanism for opting out than was contained in the Maastricht Treaty.  The &lsquo;emergency brake&rsquo; provision effectively gives Ireland, or any other state, a veto on EU action in the common foreign, security and defence areas.  In addition, the procedures for arriving at a common defence have been clarified.  If the Union agrees on a common defence, that position remains purely a recommendation until agreed to by the member states.  Ultimately, it is the people who will have to ratify any common defence arrangement in which we participate.  Successive Governments and every party in this House have committed themselves to holding a referendum on the issue.</P>
    <P>The biggest worry that most people have about a common defence is that Europe will develop into a superpower which behaves in a belligerent manner towards its neighbours and that European troops will be committed to the EU's Vietnam. The architects of the Maastricht Treaty may have been wedded to the superpower idea. However, Europe's foreign and security policy and its defence component does not have to follow that model.  If Ireland and other neutral states play their role effectively, the EU can develop as a force for peace in the world.  There are already strong indications that this is the direction which <Col N="275" /> the EU's common security and foreign policy could take.  The EU persuaded France to stop nuclear testing in the South Pacific and it was a powerful voice for a peaceful resolution of the recent Iraqi crisis.  At the Kyoto conference it was the EU which led the way, showing that it can play a role in world affairs to the benefit of the people of the world.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty set up the common foreign and security policy and directed the EU towards a common defence, leaving Ireland aside. On the other hand, the Amsterdam Treaty strengthens the position, influence and power of the neutral countries.  On this basis alone, it is a considerable improvement on the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left will support the Amsterdam Treaty but we have criticisms.  The treaty redresses some of the imbalance between the strong legal and financial instruments which are available for economic policy and those which are available for dealing with poverty, unemployment and the labour market.  We will have to wait and see how member states and the EU's institutions respond in practice.</P>
    <P>The practical effects must be in doubt given that the guiding principles are short on substance and specifics and, above all, extremely vague as regards details of the financial programmes to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>The constant iteration that employment policy is the exclusive responsibility of member states flies against the clear wishes of European citizens who are inclined to ask what is the point of Europe if it does not take effective action on unemployment and poverty.  Of the 350 million people living in the European Union, 50 million, or 15 per cent, remain too poor to consume the goods and services offered in the European market. The challenges for the future of Europe are how to address poverty and social exclusion within its boundaries, how to manage enlargement by bringing in countries and people who are currently poorer than the European mainstream and how to relate to the Third World.</P>
    <P>The answers to these questions will be different for those who regard the market as supreme and those of us who believe it is necessary to keep it in check.  For those of us who believe in controlling the market, who believe that people, not economics, should be at the heart of the European project, the Amsterdam Treaty represents an advance and a measure on which we can build. I am, therefore, happy to recommend its approval by the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision by Democratic Left to endorse the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Bill proposes to amend the Constitution. Under our internal arrangements any extension of the powers or scope of the European Union requires a constitutional amendment under which the people permit the State to ratify the relevant treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> Given that this is our domestic practice and that there will be a referendum in some weeks, the first question the public will ask is why we have a treaty at all.  The first technical reason is that the Maastricht Treaty required a review of its provisions by an intergovernmental conference within five years of its conclusion.  We committed ourselves to a review of the Maastricht Treaty when we signed and ratified it.  This modest treaty &mdash; it has much to be modest about &mdash; raises questions about whether it is appropriate in European matters to adopt a procedure which commits one in advance to holding an intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, the intergovernmental conference was convened at a time when Europe faced many challenges.  The first challenge was enlargement, which was brought about as a result of the disintegration in Eastern Europe of the old Communist ideology.  There was a natural demand by the people of Central and Eastern Europe for accession to the European Union. There was also the challenge of the common currency. There is a danger that the issue of the common currency, which has nothing to do with the Amsterdam Treaty, may somehow become part of the debate on the treaty's provisions.  We agreed the common currency when we ratified the Maastricht Treaty and adopted the previous referendum.  This will have to be spelt out loud and clear to the public during the referendum campaign.  There is a grave danger that this referendum could simply become a plebiscite on the common currency.  The common currency has been agreed and will come into effect next year. We use phrases such as &ldquo;a citizen's Europe&rdquo;.  For the vast majority of the public &ldquo;a citizen's Europe&rdquo; is the impending common currency. That is how the citizen is affected by Europe.</P>
    <P>Other challenges include the general state of the fragile global village and whether there is an adequate European response to the various problems which face us on the international field.  As the European Union becomes larger there is a demand for what is termed &ldquo;variable geometry&rdquo; where different States want to proceed at different paces.  There is also a demand for a people's Europe, a Europe which is somehow brought closer to the citizen.</P>
    <P>These are the challenges which faced the intergovernmental conference, and the treaty attempts to respond to these.  I described the treaty as modest because that is what it is.  Was it required in a strict constitutional sense to submit the treaty to the people?  This Government and the previous Government took a decision from a political perspective that the treaty had to be submitted to the people.</P>
    <P>The philosophy of this modest treaty is well summarised in Article 8.1 which deals with citizenship. It states:</P>
    <P>Citizenship of the Union is hereby established. Every person holding the nationality of a member state shall be a citizen of the Union. <Col N="277" /> Citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship.</P>
    <P>This confirms what was decided at Maastricht, that one is both an Irish and EU national and the citizen has a dual nationality in the new evolving European entity.</P>
    <P>The first provisions of the treaty I wish to examine relate to institutional change.  I referred to the challenge of enlargement.  The great challenge facing Union institutions in this regard is its ability to cope with the very large number of member states.  I congratulate our negotiators on protecting the interests of the smaller states in securing adequate representation in the Commission. The fact that each member state will continue to have representation in the Commission is a valuable acquisition from our point of view.  Clearly the object of our diplomacy was to strengthen the position of the Commission which is seen as a guarantor and protector of the interests of the smaller states.  I congratulate the negotiators on securing this concession.</P>
    <P>The view has been canvassed that this concession was obtained at a price.  The price is that in future concessions will readily be given on the precise number of votes required to secure a qualified majority in Council decision-making.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on this point.  One of the reasons it has been suggested the Union has a democratic deficit is that there is a qualified majority voting procedure in the Council where, in effect, Ministers are no longer accountable to their national parliaments, yet there is no democratic control over them on the European plane.  I agree that this is a very difficult issue for a smaller state because the influence of a small country like Ireland in the European Parliament is diluted, notwithstanding the excellent contribution made by many Irish members over many years.</P>
    <P>We should look at the experience in the United States where the founding fathers in devising a constitution provided for an inequality in representation in the House of Representatives &mdash; they allowed the Parliament to reflect the population &mdash; and also provided for a Senate with a strict equality between states.  One of the difficulties I see in terms of the way the Union is evolving is that the rights of smaller states are not being protected in this manner.  In other words, while there is weighted representation in the Parliament, the larger delegations from the larger member states have a preponderant influence.  There is also a preponderance of qualified majority and weighted voting in the Council which suits the larger states.  I appreciate our interests were well protected in the Commission but the time may have arrived when we will have to do some fundamental thinking on where future institutional development in the Union takes place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to the protection of human rights.  The Council of Europe has not been incorporated as a pillar of the new Europe. Respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law will become a basic acid test of whether a <Col N="278" /> country is entitled to belong to the Union in the first place.  This is a necessary provision we must introduce given that the number of member states of the Union is being extended.  There was a problem with Greece in the l960s when moves were taken to expel it from the Council of Europe at the time of the colonels' take-over. Eventually the colonels obliged by denouncing the European Convention on European Rights and Fundamental Freedoms so the Council did not have to take action against them.  The power is being given to these institutions to deal with a similar problem if it arises.</P>
    <P>We hope it will not arise but it is important that the Union be equipped with this power as it embarks upon enlargement.</P>
    <P>In the context of institutional change I wish to raise the future of the European Court of Justice which has been a very successful community institution. Whatever about the democratic deficit, the construction of a judicial Europe has been fairly successful as have been the devices adopted to ensure a uniformity of community law, as adopted by the courts and the treaties, throughout the EU. However, it seems unsatisfactory in such a large community with so many member states that so much of the jurisdiction of the ultimate court of resort is original and that so many disputes are referred to the court or determined by it at first instance.  The court of first instance, established under previous treaties, should be broadened to have universal jurisdiction while the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice should be exclusively based on appeal, similar to our own Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam are welcome in the context of a common currency as they complement monetary union and market development with firm objectives in employment and social policy, as referred to by Deputy Gilmore. This is most welcome as balanced economic thinking requires that these factors be taken into account.  It is a welcome change that such issues are at the forefront of the Treaty of Amsterdam as objectives to which the Union subscribes.</P>
    <P>In the context of social policy I welcome the fact that the UK will no longer seek to opt out of the social provisions of the treaty.  This is very welcome from Ireland's point of view as a disadvantage would have been imposed on Irish business and competitiveness if the UK had been permitted to opt out of the social provisions of the treaty while Ireland signed up to them.  This is a distinct advance for Ireland and should be stressed in public debate as a welcome aspect of the treaty.  I note that a legal basis has also been provided for the social programmes which the community adopted on a pilot basis in some members states.  The Irish Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, has taken a particular interest in these developments.  The legal basis provided for them is to be welcomed as some member states had <Col N="279" /> questioned whether such a basis existed for these programmes.</P>
    <P>The precise verbal formulations which diplomats adopt in treaties in the context of foreign and security policy are not of great importance. The Single European Act contained provisions concerning a common foreign policy which were built upon in the Maastricht Treaty.  They are again built upon in the Treaty of Amsterdam, but the principle that important decisions must be taken by unanimity remains.  Therefore, the question of closer co-operation on foreign policy remains primarily in the political sphere.  Whether the Union wants to act in unison in relation to particular international incidents is a matter of political will.  I welcome the initiatives taken within the framework of political co-operation in regard to Iraq and the positive role that was played.  It is difficult to secure agreement among the larger member states in this area as they have different historical and regional allegiances.  It is understandable why in the 1960s General de Gaulle had reservations about UK membership of the community because of the special relationship between the UK and the US, with which we are familiar.  The other larger member states have their own historic allegiances outside the community which tend to affect the formulation of a common policy.  I welcome that fact that the Petersberg Tasks may be performed within a community framework.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comment by Deputy Gilmore that Democratic Left considers that the treaty protects our position on neutrality to a greater extent than the Maastricht Treaty and that the party does not see it as a threat to our policy of military neutrality.  This was an interesting comment as a <i>nihil obstat</i> from that quarter carries more weight than anything I could say.  I wonder about the view of the Green Party given that the provisions on neutrality have passed the strictly, orthodox litmus test of Democratic Left.  I suspect the Green Party has taken an opportunistic political position in relation to the treaty.  The party may see some mileage in opposing on the basis that other parties have decided to support it and present it as a constructive, logical step in our participation in European institutions.  The party is claiming that those who, for whatever reason, are not prepared to consent to this change are disguised supporters of it.  However, it is that party's prerogative in a free society to oppose the treaty.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that unity cannot always be achieved between member states in the context of variable geometry and the concept of member states proceeding at different paces.  However, the larger the number of member states the greater the probability of a varying pace. Regional arrangements between member states are inevitable given the evolution of the community and the increase in the number of member states.  The treaty contains various provisions facilitating this process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> I described the treaty as a modest document, but there are real improvements in the context of a people's Europe.  However, we should not over state such improvements.  There is an attempt to forge a closer identification between the citizen and Europe through increased provisions on consumer protection, employment, social policy and free movement of persons within the enlarged Union.  The concern of the economic model of the Union was with the free movement of workers. We are now attempting to move towards the free movement of people in general.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always had a common travel area with the UK.  I disagreed strongly with Deputy Gilmore's suggestion that we should attempt to go it alone and accept the Schengen agreement as soon as possible.  The harsh geographical fact is that the bulk of transit in and out of Ireland is to and from the United Kingdom and I do not understand how we can subscribe to the Schengen arrangement, desirable though it may be.  Our negotiators made it clear that we have no objection to subscribing to the agreement in principle.  However, there is a practical objection as long as the UK does not to subscribe to it. Unlike the common currency, this is not an area where we can go it alone as there is little sense in introducing passport controls with Great Britain and Northern Ireland in order to avoid such controls with other member states.  Perhaps there is a special reason in the ideology of Democratic Left which makes it desirable to have passport controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic, but it would be undesirable to introduce such a principle.  Our negotiators did a very good job on the issue of free movement of persons. They secured the right for Ireland to opt into this arrangement in the future.  They also made clear to our partners in Europe that we have no objection to the free movement of persons within the EU but have a practical problem which makes it impossible for us to be part of the Schengen agreement as long as the UK objects to it.  This is understandable given the number of people who move between the two states.  We are free to adopt the flanking measures in the treaty associated with the free movement of persons relating to asylum policy, border controls, etc., throughout the EU.  We can examine the issue of harmonising arrangements with our partners. However, we cannot opt for free movement until the UK does so.</P>
    <P>The treaty is a modest document but is a real step forward for the State.  I and my party are happy to endorse it as a valuable contribution to the process of European development.</P>

      <P>The Green Party will be campaigning for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the upcoming referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  This decision is based not on opportunism, as Deputy Lenihan implied, but on both the failure of the new treaty to live up to its own proclaimed goals and the inclusion in the treaty of provisions which the Green Party believes endanger democracy, <Col N="281" /> human rights and international peace and security.</P>
      <P>The Green Party is internationalist in outlook. We strongly support European and international co-operation.  We also believe in strong democratic control of decision making and therefore support decentralisation and the taking of decisions at the lowest appropriate level.  The Green Party welcomes European Union involvement in areas which are best dealt with at European level, such as environmental protection and the safeguarding of human rights, but is wary of the EU usurping the role of the United Nations in the area of international peace and security or the roles of local and national governments in the determination of economic policies.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with areas of the Amsterdam Treaty with which we have problems.  The Green Party will be opposing the treaty on a number of grounds including the democratic deficit, as it is known, the Employment Chapter and the Social Protocol, which we believe are too limited.  We have major concerns about human rights and civil liberties and we believe the environmental issues in the treaty are inadequately tackled.  An issue we feel strongly about is the fact that Ireland's neutrality is weakened and the EU is further militarised.</P>
      <P>On the question of the democratic deficit, despite the fact that the European Parliament is the only directly elected institution of the European Union, it is unable to function as a real parliament. It cannot initiate legislation.  The Amsterdam Treaty has increased the areas of co-decision between the Council and the Parliament but this increase is in no way commensurate with the extension of the areas of competence of the EU.  For example, Parliament's budgetary powers have been increased somewhat in the Second and Third Pillars' operational expenditure but it has virtually no power in regard to EMU where the co-operation procedure applies.  It is the unelected Commission, which has been strengthened under the Amsterdam Treaty, that proposes legislation, while the real power of legislating rests mainly with the Council which is infamous for its lack of openness.  Even the Parliament has difficulty gaining access to Council's deliberations, and the Council fails to adequately brief parliamentary committees.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty provides some improvement in transparency and Article 191 provides to any Union resident or citizen the right of access to Parliament, Council and Commission documents, but these rights are restricted at the discretion of the relevant institutions.</P>
      <P>In terms of EU citizenship, the Amsterdam Treaty has not added much to the Maastricht Treaty.  The Green Group wanted citizenship extended to non-EU citizens who are resident but this did not happen thereby excluding ten million residents from voting in local and European elections and denying them fundamental rights and petition rights.  This will have serious implications for refugees and migrants across Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> The Green Party welcomes the inclusion for the first time of an explicit statement, Article F.1, on respect for fundamental human rights.  We welcome the fact that respect for these rights is a criterion for EU membership and that violation of these rights can cause expulsion of an existing member.  The European Court of Justice now has power explicitly to ensure EU respect for human rights in the First and Third Pillar areas of its competence, which is limited.</P>
    <P>The anti-discrimination and social exclusion sections of the Amsterdam Treaty, while making some positive advances, fall short of what we had hoped.  References to the elderly, who were mentioned originally in Article 118(2), have been deleted.  There was also a request from a number of NGOs to initiate a civil dialogue in the EU involving a broader range of organisations than just the social partners.  This, too, failed to happen.</P>
    <P>Despite some advances, therefore, the Amsterdam Treaty has failed to remedy the anti-democratic nature of the European Union and has failed to make substantial gains for those living in the EU.  This lack of democracy and accountability in the EU will be a point of criticism by the Green Party when considering a number of other areas of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Green Party welcomes the fact that a new Chapter on Employment, Title 6a, has been added to the EC Treaty and that the Social Protocol has now been brought into the body of the treaty.  However, gains in social policy in general have been deemed only as modest by a number of commentators and social policy has been seen as the poor relation in EU negotiations in the run up to the introduction of EMU.  Considering the disruption EMU is seen to be causing in many EU states, as member states make economic adjustments to qualify for the first EMU wave, this relegation of the social dimension is a cause for concern.  The Social Policy Chapter is positive in its defence of workers and employers in terms of working conditions, health and safety but does not apply to pay, rights of association and the right to collective action and bargaining.  It also primarily refers to the rights of the employed and therefore has little impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>Given the high rates of unemployment in a number of EU states &mdash; Spain has nearly 20 per cent, France has 12.6 per cent, Ireland has 10 per cent, Germany has 12 per cent and rising &mdash; the inclusion of an employment chapter is a welcome development.  Of the active population in the EU, 18 million, or approximately 11 per cent, are officially unemployed.  Half of those have been unemployed for more than one year.  More than one-fifth of all young people in the EU have no work and nearly 52 million people live below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>An employment committee is to be established to monitor progress of the EU in co-ordinating employment policies in co-operation with the member states, and there will be annual reviews and reports from each state in an effort to assess <Col N="283" /> progress in achieving a high level of employment. The Green Party is disappointed, however, that there is no commitment to full employment in the treaty and that there is no injection of Green economics.  The old ideology of fostering growth to overcome unemployment remains.  Indeed, the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; does not even appear in the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Greens believe that full employment should be an EU objective.  This would be assisted by policies involving the reduction of working time, the transition to production methods which are more resource effective and the production of goods and services which are more ecologically and socially sustainable.  The Amsterdam Treaty has ignored calls from the European Parliament to shift the tax burden from employment to environment consumption and pollution in order to foster sustainable investment.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is also concerned at the impact EMU will have on unemployment and believes it is a major failing of EU policy that EMU criteria concentrated on the achievement of low public debt and low inflation and ignored any inclusion of low unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty adds a new EU objective to Article B of Maastricht &ldquo;to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is assured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and the prevention and combating of crime&rdquo;.  The Green Party welcomes the development of freedom of movement and advances in the combating of crime.  We are concerned, however, that some of the provisions involving refugees, asylum and other operations of Schengen and Europol could have adverse effects on humans rights and democracy.</P>
    <P>The Green Group in the European Parliament fears that nothing will change in the undemocratic and uncontrollable functioning of Schengen and calls for an enhanced role for the Parliament, both from the legislative and supervisory point of view, and for the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>No citizen, NGO or even the European Parliament can bring an action before the European Court of Justice.  For the first time the European Court of Justice has been given some very limited jurisdiction over provisions in the Third Pillar dealing with police and judicial co-operation on criminal matters, but the court has no jurisdiction over the behaviour of police or law enforcement bodies or the exercise of responsibilities incumbent on member states with regard to the maintenance of law and order and the safeguarding of internal security.  One could argue that every measure or decision of the justice and home affairs sector deals with law and order and internal security.</P>
    <P>There is very little judicial control over Europol, which will now have powers to deal with 18 policing roles, from illegal immigration to drugs. <Col N="284" /> Not once during the two year drafting was the European Parliament consulted.  Article K.6 of the Maastricht Treaty calls for such consultation on principal developments in justice and home affairs and states that Parliament's views must be duly taken into consideration.  Parliament was not and will not be consulted.  Article K.11 of the Amsterdam Treaty provides for the Parliament to be consulted on laws on police co-operation already agreed by the Council of Ministers, but Parliament's powers extend only to delivering opinions, asking questions and holding annual debates.  National parliaments also will have no power to exercise democratic control over Europol. The day to day activities of Europol will be the responsibility of a management report and national parliaments can only request their governments to instruct their representatives on that board.  Decisions are by a two-thirds majority and individual states can be overruled.</P>
    <P>Articles 7 and 10 of the Europol Convention give Europol powers of data collection which go far beyond what is needed to combat crime and which raise grave questions about civil liberties. Not only can Europol collect data on known and suspected criminals but also on those it is presumed may carry out a criminal offence and any potential victim or witness, which is a very wide net.  Data can be collected on lifestyles, racial origin, religious or political beliefs, sexuality and health.  The key question is: who is monitoring Europol?</P>
    <P>The Green Party shares concerns expressed by Amnesty International, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, the Quakers and a number of NGOs about the provisions concerning asylum and refugees.  While expressing its support for the 1951 Geneva Convention on Refugees, the Amsterdam Treaty appears to ignore the Convention in several instances.  For example, there is no reference to adhering to the Convention when dealing with temporary protection of refugees, responsibility-sharing, some immigration matters and incidents of sudden mass influx of refugees &mdash; they are dealt with in Articles 73.  k.2 and 73.1.2. Both Amnesty International and the UNHCR have taken issue with the EU's interpretation of the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in the Geneva Convention, which sees the EU excluding those persecuted by non-state agents, for example, rebel groups.  The UNHCR has attacked the EU's narrow definition as one that erodes refugee principles and could leave large numbers of refugees without adequate protection.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty contains a protocol on asylum which has been heavily criticised by human rights organisations.  The protocol suppresses the rights of EU nationals to seek asylum in another member state except in exceptional circumstances.  The UNHCR similarly attacks the protocol, and in a press release following the Amsterdam summit in June 1997 the UNHCR expressed serious concern about the EU's decision to restrict EU citizens' right to asylum <Col N="285" /> and said the protocol weakened the Geneva Convention on Refugees.  It stated:</P>
    <P>If the EU applies limitations to the Convention, others can follow and could weaken the universality of the instrument for the international protection of refugees.  We do not, therefore, share the position taken in the preamble [of Amsterdam] stating that the protocol respects the Convention.</P>
    <P>The Common Foreign and Security Policy &mdash; CFSP &mdash; is dealt with under Title V of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Contrary to some comment the changes brought in by Amsterdam constitute significant new powers.  Under the Treaty the EU is given an enhanced role at the expense of member states in foreign and security policy.  It is now the &ldquo;Union&rdquo;, not &ldquo;the Union and its member states&rdquo; as stated in the Maastricht Treaty, that shall define and implement a common foreign and security policy.  A new Article J.2 allows the Union to define the principles and general guidelines for the CFSP, to decide common strategies and adopt joint actions and common positions. Article J.3 states that the European Council shall define the principles of general guidelines for the CFSP, including matters with defence implications. Article J.7 states that the CFSP will include the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;, as opposed to &ldquo;eventual&rdquo; in the Maastricht Treaty, framing of a common defence policy and that this defence policy has to be in accordance with the involvement of the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>The European Council is given power to decide whether an EU common defence should be established, with the proviso that this decision must be referred back to member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. More decisions in the CFSP will be taken by qualified majority voting.  A new high representative, the present Secretary General of the Council, will be appointed and assisted by a new planning and early warning unit whose personnel will include individuals from the Western European Union.  This can be viewed as an embryo Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Western European Union, a military grouping based on nuclear weapons and inextricably linked with NATO, will be further integrated into the EU and a protocol has been attached to Article 7 promising the drawing up of arrangements for enhanced co-operation between the Western European Union and the EU within a year of the Amsterdam Treaty being ratified.  Article J.7 states that the progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported as member states consider appropriate, by co-operation between them in the field of armaments.</P>
    <P>The Green Party disagreed strongly with the Maastricht Treaty for forming links with the Western European Union, a military grouping based on nuclear weapons and the European wing of NATO.  The Maastricht Treaty recognised the Western European Union as an integral part of the development of the EU and charged it <Col N="286" /> with elaborating and implementing decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications. The Green Party is opposed to defence issues being brought into the EU.  The fact that a nuclear grouping is seen as the vehicle for dealing with EU defence only serves to underline the reasons the EU should never be dragged into this area.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty does not incorporate the Western European Union completely into the EU, as a number of member states wanted, but it provides in a protocol for the possibility of such a development when it refers to arrangements for enhanced co-operation within a year of the Amsterdam Treaty being ratified.  Article J.7 adds to the Maastricht Treaty by stating that the Western European Union provides the EU with access to an operational capability and that it supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the CFSP.</P>
    <P>The most significant development in terms of the Western European Union is the inclusion of its so-called Petersberg tasks as provided for in Article J.7.2, which include not only humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, as often claimed, but also tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.  Peacemaking gives a very broad licence and could involve Irish troops in various military enforcement missions.  This opens the way for endless possibilities for the EU to intervene militarily around the world.  The adoption of the Petersberg tasks means that for the first time Irish troops may be sent abroad to peacekeep or peacemake for someone other than the UN and without a UN mandate.  This is a major foreign and defence policy departure.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the way the CFSP makes its decisions.</P>
    <P>I refute the view expressed by previous speakers that the treaty is not a danger to Irish neutrality. It represents a significant erosion of our neutrality.  Much has been made of the fact that three Opposition parties support the treaty.  They negotiated it and therefore find themselves in a position where they have little choice but to support it.  Diarmuid Ross Phelan, barrister and Jean Monnet lecturer in European Law at TCD, have written on this aspect and take the view that there is no requirement for a further referendum.  The key element which the public will want to know about concerns our neutral stance.  They support it.  The Green Party also supports it and will oppose this referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">

      <P>This is the fourth referendum on Europe to be presented to the people.  We approved the previous three by debating issues which were not central to the main aspects of the treaties put before the public.  However, people may be able to identify with the main provisions of this treaty because it is the people's treaty.  The Single European Act was concerned with an internal market and the Maastricht Treaty was the blueprint for EMU, all of which was irrelevant to the voter.  By contrast, this treaty deals <Col N="287" /> with the citizens of Europe and attempts to improve our quality of life.  It deals with recommitting the EU to basic human rights and freedoms. It considers the issue of co-operation in trying to combat drugs and crime, puts the fight against unemployment at the heart of EU policy, considers equality and ways of improving the situation of the disabled, establishes consumer protection and commits the EU to a high level of human health.  It also strengthens workers' rights and has a special chapter on unemployment. These issues, and not the more general philosophical ideas which we have discussed over many years, are relevant to the people.</P>
      <P>Through our membership of the EU we have had success in economic and social terms which has been felt throughout the country.  That is what people relate to.  Despite this, they may not appreciate the extent to which money has been made available to local areas in the form of EU grants.  For example, in my constituency of Dún Laoighaire, £432,000 was allocated to the county enterprise board in one year and the southside partnership received £2.5 million over five years. There is a new Dún Laoighaire theatre and the Dalkey heritage town project has received £500,000.  With regard to the waste management strategy, £120,000 was recently allocated for waste recycling.  Fortunately many signs on projects indicate the extent to which we are being helped by Europe.  People see that Europe is money.</P>
      <P>However, we have a long way to go before a sense of European citizenship and community is developed.  There are identifiable symbols of European citizenship.  Examples include the little red common passport, which I suspect is widely disliked throughout the EU, the little red driving licence, the flag with the stars and the anthem.  Beethoven has suddenly come into his own.</P>
      <P>European citizenship is very important and we need to feel a part of it.  While 63 per cent of Irish people support the concept of European citizenship, I believe 100 per cent support the concept of national citizenship first.  It is interesting that one of the most successful small Irish businesses in recent years has been the development of a green leather cover, which shows the harp, for the common passport.  I welcome that.  The common passport is not disliked because of its usefulness or its size &mdash; it is more convenient &mdash; but because people consider that it removes an aspect of identity, which we cannot afford to lose in an overall European identity.  In view of this, it is very important that people understand we are considering a dual citizenship and partnership; it must be made clear that we are concerned with joint identity.</P>
      <P>This is also very important with regard to our language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chonacamar le déanaí go raibh baol ann go mbeadh an Biúro um Theangacha Neamh fhorleathana le scuabadh amach as an tír seo.  Tharla <Col N="288" /> sin roimh Nollaig.

Ach níl a cearta fiú á tabhairt don Ghaeilge agus tá dul chun cinn gur féidir a dhéanamh.  Is féidir aitheantas a thabhairt i measc tíortha a bhfuil mionteangacha acu &mdash; Éire ina measc, an Bhreatain Bheag, An Fhrainc agus tíortha nach iad.  Ba mhaith liom mar sin go bhfeicimis ins an bhféiniúlacht seo, an féiniúlacht náisiúnta agus an féiniúlacht Eorpach atá ann, níos mó cabhrach á thabhairt do na nithe a thugann an féiniúlacht sin dúinn, ár dteanga ina measc.</P>
    <P>The human rights issue has been addressed in this House on a number of occasions, even since my election.  While we can deal with it at a local level it is, above all, an international issue. Human rights and democracy go hand in hand and the promotion of democracy, both within the European countries and outside the EU, is at the core of the Amsterdam Treaty.  In one year, 1996, the promotion of human rights cost the EU £67.5 million.  This work deals with combating corruption and helping cross border partnerships, especially in central and eastern Europe, including those countries which are about to become a core part of the EU.</P>
    <P>Linked to this is our commitment to combating racism.  I regret, as I am sure everybody did, the photograph in a newspaper yesterday taken in Ennis, County Clare, which depicted a swastika with the words &ldquo;white power&rdquo;.  This kind of racism must be wiped out before it takes a foothold in this country.  It can be done at a Europe wide level because the foundations of racism reached us from there.  Last year was the European year against racism and much work was done with young people, especially in the schools. I raise this issue now because the Amsterdam Treaty has a specific clause on anti-discrimination. There will be a monitoring centre for racism and xenophobia which will work closely with the reinforcement provisions set out in the treaty.</P>
    <P>Human rights, fundamental rights and non-discrimination are the key principles on which our society is based and which the Amsterdam Treaty seeks to enshrine.  The social rights are defined in the European social charter and the Community charter of the fundamental social rights of workers is confirmed as fundamental in the treaty.  The anti-discrimination clause does not just refer to racism but aims at promoting equality of the sexes and prohibiting discrimination on grounds of disability, ethnic origin, religion or belief, age or sexual orientation.  It also includes a specific declaration on persons with disability, which I welcome, and which says that when drawing up measures, the institutions of the community shall take account of the needs of the persons with a disability.  This puts the onus on all policy makers to ensure that policies are disabled friendly.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is more clearly based <Col N="289" /> on the interests of citizens than any previous treaty.  The changes are wide ranging and positive and give citizens increased rights.  They provide states with even greater means of enforcing the principles of non-discrimination, particularly through the active promotion of equality between men and women.  It should be recognised that the development of equality for women in legislation, pay and work over the past 20 years would not and could not have come about but for Ireland's membership of the EU.  Successive Governments, occasionally on their own initiative but mainly because they were forced to enact EU directives, had to introduce measures to improve equality of the sexes.  This is further developed in the Amsterdam Treaty and it must be a principal consideration when drafting all EU legislation.  The EU is empowered to take action against sexual discrimination and the policies of pay, opportunity and treatment are reinforced in the treaty.</P>
    <P>I welcome EU directives over the years which led to equal pay for men and women, equal access to employment, training, promotion and working conditions, equal treatment for men and women in social security and the implementation of parental and adoptive leave measures in 1996.  The Government was recently brought to court for discriminating against women in the social welfare system because men received a higher unemployment benefit rate than women.  Ireland was not the only country brought to court so we should not be embarrassed about it.  The case was successfully appealed to the European Court of Justice and many women received social welfare back payments.  The UK was caught in a similar position in the European Court of Justice, although it related to a different case.  If the House fails in its responsibility, there is a higher court which will insist that Ireland meets its responsibilities and ensures that equality is introduced.</P>
    <P>In relation to money from the EU, a quarter of the European Social Fund is directed towards promoting equality for women, the disabled and minority ethnic groups.  All funds are monitored for gender equality and this is welcome. However, women in the EU are still more likely to be unemployed than men.  Women hold more part-time jobs than men and women throughout the EU are paid approximately 20 per cent less than men.  I welcome the important provisions which recognise that women need to be encouraged to take their place in the workforce, particularly in relation to part-time work because the majority of part-time workers are women.  In 1997, European employer and trade union bodies agreed to extend to part-time workers the same rights as full-time employees.  This is most important for the female workforce.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years the number of women in employment has grown from 46 million to 61 million, but we have a long way to go in terms of facilitating women re-entering or staying in the workforce.  I welcome the recent introduction in <Col N="290" /> Ireland by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, of the directive on parental and adoptive leave.  Parents will be able to take up to three months' unpaid leave at any time up to a child's eighth birthday.  These types of measure are initiated in Europe and then enforced in Ireland.  This makes Europe relevant to people.</P>
    <P>Small and medium size enterprises are most important.  It is interesting to note that the majority of small enterprises established in the EU in the past decade were set up by women.  I welcome the increased support for SMEs in Europe and in the context of employment under the Amsterdam Treaty.  European statistics show that women live longer than men and, therefore, perhaps women should be promoted more.  The life expectancy is 80 years for women and 73.7 years for men, but I would not discriminate against men in any of these matters.</P>
    <P>The main provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty relate to the fight against crime and drugs.  In recent years, we have witnessed the decimation of areas and young people by drugs.  We have tried to tackle this problem at local and national levels.  Perhaps one of the most significant measures was the proceeds of crime Act introduced in 1996 following the initiation of a Private Members' Bill by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, when in Opposition.  However, wiping out the gangs does not wipe out the problem.  It will continue because Ireland is an island and any measure introduced at national and European levels should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>When one considers the number of ports in Ireland, one must welcome the extension of Europol.  It is not a police force and does not mean German, French or Italian guards running round the ports of Ireland.  Europol is a method of exchanging information between the police forces of the member states.  Ireland ratified the Europol Convention and this means information can be fed through our computer networks.  A recent example in this area is the arrests in Amsterdam.  This benefited the Irish system and people in so far as it removed persons from the distribution of drugs network.</P>
    <P>There are a number of EU regulations to combat the manufacturing and trafficking of illegal drugs.  The amount of drugs seized in Ireland is a credit to the Garda Síochána.  According to the 1996 Garda report, 10.8 kilos of heroin and almost 20,000 ecstasy tablets were seized that year.  However, if that is the level of drugs seized, we can be sure it is only the tip of the iceberg. Consumption has not been reduced.  It is important the EU looks beyond its member states and devotes some of its budget to combating the drugs problem in non-EU countries.  Some money has already been spent in this area.  For example, in 1987, 5.5 ECU was spent in that regard.  In 1996 in the EU, the sum spent on trying to combat drugs and their distribution from other countries increased from IR£4.1 million to IR£40 million. <Col N="291" /> European statistics show that the average age of drug addicts in Ireland is 24 years.  This is the lowest age in the EU and makes us realise that the young people of Ireland are suffering most at the hands of drug trafficking.  Therefore, we benefit most from Europol and EU directives in this area.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty provides an even stronger role for Europol in the fight against drugs.  It extends responsibility in this area and the scope for co-operation between member states.  For the first time a European treaty cites the fight against drugs as a specific objective. Each member state will be asked to account for its actions in this regard and the EU will take action to provide citizens with a high level of safety.  We welcome this for all our young people.</P>
    <P>The other key issue in the Amsterdam Treaty relates to employment.  I referred to women in employment and the provision of new funding measures to create jobs, greater co-operation between member states to produce better employment opportunities and new incentives from the European Council to promote employment are listed in the treaty.  The Treaty of Rome recognised this area in the late 1950s and the Amsterdam Treaty brings it another step further. To say the Amsterdam Treaty is above and beyond the people and should be opposed for that reason, as the Green Party suggests, fails to recognise its value.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this Bill and pledge my party's opposition to the proposed amendment to the Constitution to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Deputy Quinn remarked on the lack of reporters in the gallery for this debate.  I note a greater omission: the almost complete lack of representation in the House of the views of the vast majority of people who want to retain Irish neutrality and independent Irish foreign policy.  That majority is almost voiceless in the House, but it is also clear that there is no great enthusiasm for this referendum on the Government benches.  It is the latest step <Col N="292" /> on the road to a united states of Europe.  Many Members on all sides would be very happy if this amendment to the Constitution could be slipped past the people with minimal scrutiny or debate. Once again an attempt is being made to hoodwink the public.</P>
    <P>However, many in political life and other spheres are profoundly opposed to the erosion of our independence on the world stage and to our entanglement in a nuclear armed European superstate.  This also applies to monetary union.  I note that contrary to comments made by Gay Byrne this morning on radio, many elected public representatives have not joined the blind stampede to complete EU integration regardless of the damaging consequences for our economy.  My party stands firmly for Irish national sovereignty. Vital elements of that sovereignty are military neutrality and an independent foreign policy.  It is ironic that on the anniversary of 1798 the Government is seeking to dilute again the degree of sovereignty we have retained in the 26 counties. Wolfe Tone was the first to make the case for an independent Irish foreign policy, and that has been a principle of all progressive movements in our history.  It is supported overwhelmingly by the people.  That is why the Government and the other political parties that want the Amsterdam Treaty approved are so anxious to convince the people that our neutrality is not under threat.</P>
    <P>The signing of the Amsterdam Treaty last year received minimal media coverage in Ireland. Even less was heard about the implications for Irish sovereignty and neutrality.  On this occasion, however, the people are being alerted to the dangers of making the 1937 Constitution subservient to the EU.  For many years the process of EU integration has been eroding our neutrality.  Successive Governments have given a little more away at each stage.  On the few occasions they have had to go to the people for approval for their latest abandonment of our rights they have assured us that nothing has really changed. Repeatedly we have been told in recent months that this treaty does not affect Irish neutrality. Yesterday the Taoiseach went further by claiming that it strengthens Irish neutrality.  The wording of the treaty could not be clearer, however, and it is patently incompatible with Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty reiterates the EU's &ldquo;common foreign and security policy&rdquo; and the progressive framing of a common defence policy. It states:</P>
    <P>The Western European Union [ which is the European wing of NATO ] is an integral part of the development of the Union, providing the Union with access to an operational capability. It supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the common foreign and security policy as set out in this Article.  The Union shall accordingly foster closer institutional relations with the Western European Union with a view to the possibility of the integration of the Western European Union into the Union should the European Council so decide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Neutrality is totally incompatible with the declaration adopted at Amsterdam which commits the State to support the following:</P>
    <P>In the declaration on the role of the Western European Union and its relations with the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance [which we know as NATO] of 10 December 1991, Western European Union member States set as their objective to build up Western European Union in stages as the defence component of the European Union.  They today reaffirm the same as developed by the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>This is damning evidence.  I ask Fianna Fáil Deputies to note Fine Gael's recent announcement of support for this State joining NATO's so called Partnership for Peace.  Do those Fianna Fáil Deputies, who profess support for neutrality, want to amend the Constitution in this way and trust a future Fine Gaelled Government with our neutrality?</P>
    <P>As well as moving on the project for &ldquo;common defence&rdquo;, the Amsterdam Treaty significantly hardens the EU's common foreign policy.  The State will thus be obliged majority voting on foreign policy.  An unelected EU official will be appointed High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy.  In effect, he or she will be the Foreign Minister for the entire EU.</P>
    <P>The Government has also signed up to a paragraph of the treaty which gets very little attention. It states:</P>
    <P>The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported as member States consider appropriate by co-operation between them in the field of armaments.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that while we are attempting to create a peace settlement in Ireland, to remove the gun forever from Irish politics, the Government is asking the people to sign up to a treaty that supports the European arms industries.  This part of the treaty points out the real agenda behind the drive to a common so-called &ldquo;defence policy&rdquo;.  In all NATO and Western European Union countries there are military bureaucracies linked to arms industries for whom the end of the Cold War was a very unwelcome step.  Where now the excuse for the existence of this hugely profitable military based industry?  Instead of widespread nuclear disarmament, the wholesale reduction of armies and the conversion of arms industries, the nuclear infrastructure has been kept intact.  We have seen the expansion of NATO and the Western European Union as well as the ever growing arms industries fuelling wars throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Irish people do not want to be part of that and we should reject the Amsterdam Treaty.  My party will urge the people to do so and will urge the Government to return to its EU partners to renegotiate the treaty.  The Government should also deliver the constitutional referendum that safeguards neutrality which was promised by two <Col N="294" /> successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs: one from the Rainbow Coalition and the incumbent.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably the responsibility is ours to reflect the views of the people and not to lead them blindly into future oblivion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Above all, we have a responsibility to the people to tell the truth.  One of the things that has astonished me about the debate so far is the manner in which the truth has been distorted and ignored.  It is ironic that 1798 should be cited as a reason to vote against the Amsterdam Treaty because in that year Irish leaders looked to Europe to ensure our freedom.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty has correctly been described as the people's treaty.  It is the first of the many treaties signed in Europe since 1950 that can be described as such because its focus is on the people.  The treaty is a welcome addition to the small library of treaty provisions.  It strengthens the existing treaties in areas which are important to all our citizens.  It strengthens the Union is so far as the rights of citizens and workers are concerned. It also strengthens its commitment to the battle against poverty and unemployment and in connection with basic human rights.  In spite of the positive elements in the treaty there is a perverse and even mendacious attempt in this House and elsewhere to portray it as a negative document. This is particularly evident in the Green Party's approach whose attitude to the treaty raises a fundamental question about its credibility on any issue.</P>
      <P>While the Single European Act paved the way for the completion of the internal market and the Maastricht Treaty predominantly set out the blueprint for economic and monetary union, the Amsterdam Treaty provides new powers for the Union in a range of areas aimed at protecting the citizens of Europe, enhancing their quality of life and protecting fundamental rights.  The treaty recommits the European Union to basic human rights and freedom.  Can any Member or citizen of this State argue against that?  I do not believe they can.  The treaty allocates new powers to the European Union to combat discrimination.  Can any rational person argue against that?  It reinforces co-operation between customs, judicial and police authorities of the member states in the fight against crime and drugs.  It was stated here recently that our drug addiction problem hits the very youngest.  I have attended far too many funerals of young boys and girls in my constituency who have gone to meet their maker because of the drugs problem.  How could any Member of the House argue against such co-operation between the authorities.  How can the Green Party portray this as not helping in the fight against drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The treaty places the fight against unemployment at the heart of European Union policy. Having regard to the ravages of unemployment and the social deprivation we experienced for many years, how can anybody argue against a <Col N="295" /> treaty that seeks to elevate unemployment as the main priority for the Community?  The treaty places the protection of the environment as a core objective of the European Union and provides a series of amendments aimed at making the Union more mindful of environmental practices.  The Green Party has been silent on that aspect of the treaty.  The treaty commits the European Union to the highest level of human health.  Can any rational person object to that?  It aims to strengthen the rights of workers in terms of recognising the Charter on Fundamental Workers' Rights which incidentally includes the right to be represented by trade unions.  How could anybody on the left argue against that? Above all, the treaty gives the Union not only new powers but new responsibilities to combat the problems of poverty.  How can any rational Member of this or the other House argue against that?</P>
    <P>The treaty elaborates the roles of the institutions. In many ways it focuses on institutional matters which are arid and boring for many people, but that does not suggest it is a sinister document.  It also endorses the right of each member state to nominate a commissioner and gives additional powers to the European Parliament. Those aspects of the treaty have been largely ignored.  A false claim has been perpetrated that we could lose our right to nominate a commissioner when large member states are contemplating the surrender of their right to appoint a second commissioner.  How can anybody argue against a treaty that wishes to give greater democratic oversight to Europe by enhancing the powers of the Parliament?</P>
    <P>The treaty also aims to strengthen coherence in European foreign policy which has failed in the case of Africa and more recently in the case of Europe.  It has failed to support weak nations, to bolster democracy or to support human rights. Europe has had to stand by and witness ethnic cleansing in eastern and central Europe in recent years, a scandal which should not have happened in a Europe which only 50 years ago witnessed the holocaust.  How can any Member argue that coherence in foreign policy is a threat when it is aimed at preventing abhorrent events on the continent of Europe?</P>
    <P>The treaty also clarifies the role of the Union in regard to humanitarian and rescue missions in terms of peacekeeping and peacemaking.  Those laudable objectives have been perversely misrepresented, particularly by the Green Party which claims we will be compelled into becoming part of an armed and aggressive European group. Nothing could be further from the truth or the intentions of the treaty.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty continues the success story of the European Union.  It seeks to create the building blocks for a future Europe.  I note the critics inside and outside the House, including some on national radio, have not taken the trouble to even give a nod in the direction of what <Col N="296" /> the European Union has created.  Since the establishment of the Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community, we have had the longest single period of peace and progress in the recent history of this continent.  Yet that is swept aside on the most spurious of bases. It is astonishing that any citizen who has honestly examined the treaty's provisions and is aware of the State's commitment could be concerned about any aspect of it.</P>
    <P>I will deal with specific elements of the treaty. I will emphasise issues relating to the rights of citizens, fundamental human rights and non-discrimination because they have not been well covered.  The treaty places the interests of citizens at its heart.  Article 8a establishes citizenship of the Union and stresses that this European citizenship is complementary to, not a replacement for, national citizenship.  Fundamental rights and non-discrimination are key principles of the treaty. Within the chapter on fundamental rights, social rights, as defined in the European Social Charter 1961 and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights 1989, are confirmed and enhanced.</P>
    <P>The new article 6a has a significant anti-discrimination clause which aims to promote equality between the sexes and prohibit discrimination on a variety of grounds.  Article 100a is worthy of specific mention because it requires the institutions of the Union to take into account the needs of persons with disabilities.  It is the first time the needs of citizens with disabilities have been mentioned in a treaty.  The treaty sets out measures to ensure the application of the principles of non-discrimination and the principle of upholding fundamental human rights applies across the board through all the operations of the Community.  In the event of a breach of those principles by a member state, sanctions can be imposed by the Council of Ministers acting by qualified majority.  How could anybody suggest the operation of sanctions against a member state who denies fundamental rights to citizens is a threat to the nation's sovereignty.  I have never heard such preposterous nonsense.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Treaty make it easier for action to be taken to combat racism and discrimination, something to which every Irish person should sign up for.  The Amsterdam Treaty is more clearly based on the interests of citizens than any of the previous documents relating to Europe.</P>
    <P>The second area worthy of mention is the fight against crime and drugs in the European Union in which the Amsterdam Treaty provides a much stronger role for Europol.  The aim is to incorporate elements within the Treaty that will produce across-Community unity in the fight against this menace.  The Amsterdam Treaty goes much further than the Maastricht Treaty to combat drugs.  It attacks this problem by extending the Union's responsibility in the area and the scope for co-operation.  It is astonishing that intelligent Members of this House, at least one Member of <Col N="297" /> the European Parliament from the State and somebody from Denmark today, argue that giving Europol power to harmonise the police information about the drugs barons is in some way a threat to the civil rights of individual citizens. This type of latter-day Luddite thinking means we would prefer to remain apart and combat single-handedly a multinational and international pan-global menace.  It is nonsense to suggest that Europol, which is no more than a clearing house for police information which is vital in the war against drugs, is somehow or other another threat.  The only people who have any reason to worry about the treaty provisions on the fight against crime and drugs are the criminals and the drug barons.  I do not know why anyone would decide to look after their interests.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment the treaty is clear in a way that other treaty provisions have not been.  The Amsterdam treaty reinstates the commitment to improving employment opportunities across the Community.  The inclusion of an employment chapter provides a strategy for combating a growing menace in parts of Europe. Measures provided in the treaty include, for example, the requirement that member states are committed to developing a co-ordinated strategy across Europe for the creation of employment. Why would any Member be alarmed by that?  The Council and the Commission are required to produce annual reports on employment in the Community.  Guidelines will be issued and the Council will be allowed to use incentive measures to encourage co-ordination in the employment creation area.</P>
    <P>The treaty is progressive in every single regard on social policy.  It revives and consolidates the work done in the social policy area and, following the UK decision, provides for harmonisation which did not exist at the time of Maastricht.  The treaty provides that the Union will support and complement the work of member states in areas of social policy on issues such as working conditions, training, social security, occupational development, occupational hygiene, the rights of association of workers etc.  &mdash; a topical issue which is topical here.  Yet there are Members who are worried about this.  Are they worried about creating a commitment across Europe to giving workers recognition for their trade unions?</P>
    <P>For the first time there is a reference to consumer protection in this treaty.  In the original ECSC Treaty and the two treaties of Rome, the merger treaty and all the other treaties that followed there was no reference to consumer rights.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty places consumer rights at the heart of the responsibilities of the Community. Under the terms of this treaty the European Commission must put forward proposals in relation to consumer rights and the European Commission must take to itself responsibility for <Col N="298" /> ensuring that consumer rights are protected.  Why would any Member be alarmed at that?</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Green Party's silence on the issue of the environment.  The Amsterdam Treaty has explicitly enshrined the principle of sustainable development within the treaty.  Sustainable development has become a catch phrase here.  This treaty gives specific and detailed recognition to sustainable development.  Those people who argue at the drop of a hat about sustainable development are urging that we reject the treaty that contains that very issue.</P>
    <P>The integration of environmental protection into all sectoral policies is another requirement in the treaty.  Under the terms of the treaty, the Commission will have to ensure that in each policy area, each sectoral area and each functional area environmental policy is an issue and there will have to be an attempt to establish precisely the impact of any new measures in terms of the environment.</P>
    <P>The treaty elevates women's rights.  In the original Treaty of Rome women's rights were enshrined in one article.  For many years, up to the time Madame Defrenne took her case before the Court of Justice, member states thought the concept of women's rights was something it would like to achieve down the road.  I recall, as an official from the Department of Finance, when we became a member of the EEC, that all the legal advice about women's rights in the treaty was that it did not apply.  That was until the Court of Justice said otherwise.  It pointed out that was a fundamental freedom and right granted by the treaty.  The single greatest boost for women here, who represent 50 per cent of the nation, was when Madame Defrenne took her case to the Court of Justice which vindicated the rights of all citizens to be treated equally.  On women's rights the treaty elaborates on existing rights.  It provides a new article on non-discrimination.  Discrimination cannot be based on sex, race, religion, disability, ageism and sexual orientation.  There are Members who regard themselves as progressive and yet oppose this article but have not given their reasons.  They prefer to peddle half truths and innuendo about this treaty but will not deal with facts.</P>
    <P>The Common Foreign and Security Policy has been mentioned by two speakers in the most derogatory terms.  The Common Foreign and Security Policy aims to address the scandalous lacuna in Europe.  In Europe, in the past few years, we stood by and witnessed the slaughter of innocent citizens, the mechanised slaughter of people in the former Yugoslavia, the events in Albania and the problems with ethnic Albanians in east European States.  Human rights were flagrantly and scandalously abused.  We witnessed war trials.  We in Europe do not have the right to sit in our comfortable positions and let these appalling atrocities happen again.  Europeans knew what happened in Germany and in German occupied Europe in the period 1939-45.  To the discredit of Europeans, they did absolutely nothing about it but yet our friends in the Green Party would suggest <Col N="299" /> we should ignore the monstrosities, that we have no responsibility in that matter.  If every decent Irish citizen was asked if they wished to prevent those horrors recurring they would say yes.  This aspect of the treaty has been perversely and maliciously interpreted.</P>
    <P>The mechanisms of the Common Foreign and Security Policy are no threat to our neutrality. They do not commit us to anything to which we do not wish to be committed.  Above all they do not commit us to anything we are not willing and proud to involve ourselves.  This nation has been involved in peacekeeping and in peacemaking. We know we have a responsibility outside this island, that we live in a world where borders are becoming meaningless, that we enjoy not just rights but responsibilities.  The people are willing to take that on.  The little Irelanders who have treated the people with contempt by misrepresenting the treaty should think again.  There are issues which need to be teased out.  There is a responsibility on the Government to explain what it is we are trying to achieve.  It would be an abomination if the treaty was defeated.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  For reasons of which the Acting Chairman and I are aware as members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, we have a duty and responsibility to participate in the debate in the run up to the referendum.  The proposed amendment to the Constitution is welcome.  One of the lessons we learned in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty was that there was much misinformation. By the time we became aware of this it was too late to do anything about it.  Scaremongering tactics were used by those who were opposed to that treaty.  I hope the implications of the current proposal will be examined fully and that if people have reservations, they are based on factual information.</P>
      <P>During a debate on the Maastricht Treaty the audience was informed by an eminent personality that once the referendum was passed they would no longer be in control of their own destiny, that they would be subject to the combined wisdom not of the European Heads of Government but of banking and other institutions. That assertion gave people cause for concern but it was not examined at the time to establish whether it was solidly based.  I hope on this occasion there will be an enlightened and informed debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers to be given to Europol and police forces throughout Europe have been mentioned. On whose side are we?  We respect and reserve the right to protect the human and civil rights of the individual.  It is imperative, therefore, that each member state ensures that those who have criminal intent cannot escape from one jurisdiction to another with impunity because of lack of co-ordination of the efforts of the various police <Col N="300" /> forces.  It is in everybody's interest that life is made as difficult as possible for those who peddle drugs.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the logic behind the arguments which have been advanced against the proposals contained in the treaty.  It could be said that the rights of the individual will be curtailed to some extent.  Perhaps the rights of those who have criminal intent should be curtailed.  Having considered the matter rationally, we have no option but to support the proposals contained in the treaty.  On a different issue, that of enlargement, somebody said to me recently that there was no alternative.  One could say that there are many alternatives on this issue but this is the one we are pursuing.</P>
    <P>On the thorny issue of neutrality, those of us who are committed to European integration will adopt a positive attitude.  There are, however, two lines of thought.  Many people are reticent about neutrality.  Having examined the matter closely, I do not know why they are so reticent.  If another member state was attacked, would we wait until everybody else had become involved before entering the fray and declaring that we were no longer neutral?  As a member state which is committed to the European concept, we have a responsibility to protect Europe.  If we do not pursue such a policy, somebody somewhere will ask who is responsible for protecting countries which are neutral. I am not suggesting that Europe should become an aggressive super power or become involved in extinguishing fires all over the world but it should not be forgotten that throughout Europe there are a number of simmering conflicts.</P>
    <P>We declared that we were neutral during the last world war.  We were very lucky, not because we were neutral but because no one got to us.  It was the right thing to do at the time and we got away with it.  There are no guarantees that we would be as lucky again.  While we should continue to pursue a policy of neutrality, we should not attempt to divest ourselves of our responsibilities within Europe.  The alarmists will ask whether I am aware that people will be killed but that is an extreme argument which does not deserve a response.</P>
    <P>I wish to address in some detail the question of the relevance of Europe to the individual.  This treaty identifies a large number of micro issues which affect the individual.  The European Union was criticised for being remote from the people. It is ironic that this happened in a country which has benefited to a considerable degree from the Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government set out proposals in An Action Programme for the Millennium for increased funding for specific State programmes.  The House will be aware that announcements have already been made about a whole range of increases covering education, health, roads, water and sewerage schemes, housing, sport and job creation, among others.  This will allow certain programmes to be accelerated which, in turn, will allow certain projects to be brought forward and completed somewhat faster than planned.  As I stated, I discussed certain priorities with Deputies who support the Government.  In some instances the Deputies shared these priorities with this House and they are on the record of the House in that regard.  I do not propose to add anything further to the record of the House or to place various copies of correspondence with Deputies in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that it is the Government's intention to deal with most of the issues raised by the Deputies in question during the life of this Government.  We plan to do this within the parameters of departmental expenditure Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the rest of the House will join with me in wishing Deputy Healy-Rae a speedy recovery, certainly not a premature departure. Deputy Spring's request, which I support, is reasonable.  It is that a copy be made available of any formal undertakings given by the Taoiseach, <Col N="304" /> as head of Government, to any Deputy in return for that Deputy's support of this Administration. All other things being equal, any of those commitments may provide for the expenditure of public moneys.  While some correspondence may be private, will the Taoiseach make available extracts from such private correspondence which relate exclusively to commitments he as Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, gave by way of policy initiatives or public expenditure undertakings for the constituency of Kerry South?</P>

      <P>As I stated previously, Deputy Healy-Rae raised most of the issues here.  On one occasion and on last year's Estimates he raised other issues, so there is nothing new.  He also put much pressure on me and the Government to find alternative industries for Pretty Polly.  Most of the other issues, including roads, sewerage schemes and local authority grants related to the Estimates. I join with Deputy Quinn in wishing him a speedy recovery and I hope he may leave hospital quickly.  Primarily, Deputy Healy-Rae writes to me about local authority matters.</P>

      <P>Is there an exchange of correspondence between the Taoiseach and the Deputy in question, for whose speedy recovery we all hope, which involves commitments by the Government concerning public expenditure?  If such correspondence exists, does the Taoiseach believe it is proper that this House should have access to it and that it should be placed in the Library?</P>

I have had correspondence with him on issues relating to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I spoke with Deputy Healy-Rae between the election and the formation of the Government, as I did with other Deputies, and had some correspondence with him.  In fairness to the Deputy, most of the issues on which he has given me handwritten notes relate to the local authority and are not issues in which he is trying to change the parameters of public expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I received a letter dated 2 March 1998 from the chairman of the committee enclosing a memorandum of the same date setting out the work of the committee.  The memorandum set out a number of issues which are to be considered by the committee on the basis of referral, including the abortion issue following receipt of the proposed Green Paper; the individual rights of children at the request of Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, at the Department of Health and Children; nomination to the Presidency by private citizens &mdash; Private Members' Bill &mdash; in the context of nomination procedures generally at the request of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the age limit for election of TDs, Senators and the President.</P>
      <P>Other specific tasks that the committee feels it should appropriately tackle are the electoral system, Cabinet confidentiality, people with disabilities and, following a successful conclusion of the Northern Ireland peace process, changes to the Constitution to cater for consequential political arrangements such as, perhaps, North-South bodies and issues relating to funding of referenda and the implications of the McKenna case.</P>
      <P>I understand that many of these issues will be discussed by the committee, having regard to the systems into which they fall whether that be the political system or the rights system.  The committee suggested that it would be desirable if the chairman had an opportunity to discuss such issues with me as Taoiseach from time to time and if the other party representatives on the committee likewise had an opportunity to discuss such issues with their party leaders and receive political direction on them.  I propose to reply to the chairman indicating my availability for such discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee says the first tranche of proposals it made, which are contained in its first and second reports, should be put to the people in the form of proposed changes.  Has the Government considered that request of the committee and, if so, when does it intend to put those proposals in a referendum?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to that matter on 10 February and said I had set in train a detailed examination by Departments of the two progress reports which the committee put forward.  I expect that in a matter of weeks I will have detailed replies on those issues which I will then put to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Taoiseach does not yet know if he will accept any of the proposals. Does he have a view on the recommendation of the committee that the committee chairman should seek direction from him on matters affecting the committee?  Does he consider that this is wise in so far as the committee is acting independently of parties and the chairman should surely seek direction from all party leaders rather than one, if that is the course being followed?  It may simply be the drafting of the particular passage in the report to which I refer that may be open to misinterpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee asked that the chairman have the opportunity to discuss issues from time to time with me as Taoiseach and that other party representatives on the committee have the opportunity to discuss such issues with their party leaders to receive political direction.  I spoke to the chairman and the vice-chairman this week and have informal chats with them most weeks.  There is a huge workload and the committee is trying to ensure its efforts, time and commitment are likely to run politically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept that.  I felt the report might have been drafted in a way which did not reflect the true intentions of the committee. The committee recommends certain enhancement of the facilities available to the vice-chairman which would presumably require the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  Has the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance had occasion on which to consider or decide on this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there has been some concern in the committee on the difficulties in ensuring its work will be relevant to the deliberations of the Government?  Already work done by the committee on the Referendum Bill has been disregarded.  Will the Taoiseach indicate that he is committed to ensuring the good work of the committee will be relevant to the work of the Government?  I suggest that unless there is a proper connection between the work of the committee and that of Government, it will be hard for it to continue on with the dedication which is evident across all parties, of which I am sure he is aware.</P>

      <P>Of course I am aware of this. It not only relates to Government but to all parties. That is precisely the point to which Deputy Bruton and I have just referred.</P>
      <P>I will discuss with the Government the committee's request for a mechanism to be found by which it may be consulted on constitutional issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, if at all possible, the use of the committee as a dumping ground for difficult issues should be avoided, that it should be allowed continue with its work programme which has a coherence of its own, and that our first reaction every time the parties are faced with a constitutional difficulty should not be to give it to the committee so that it has the headache rather than ourselves?  I do not mean we should never do that, but our first reaction should be to see if we can overcome the constitutional difficulty ourselves rather than referring it to the committee.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the committee is taking a coherent and holistic view of the Constitution rather than a piecemeal approach and that it should be allowed do that as far as possible without interruption by politically generated fire fighting requests from the various party leaders in the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton.  It would make life easier for the Taoiseach of the day if that were the process.  Deputy McManus made a point about the Amsterdam Treaty.  I dealt with that matter effectively but it would have been simpler to give that to the committee because it took much discussion between the party leaders to ensure it was right.  It could have been sent to the committee which would have given its view on it, but I do not think that is the appropriate approach.  I am sure there are some issues from which we can benefit from the committee and it has stated that it should be consulted at times.  That is a reasonable point, but to dump all problems on it is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that, when the committee was being established by Deputy Bruton, one of the points made was that some issues and the preparation and work surrounding them last for years.  Therefore, the committee should be allowed some continuity. The Whitaker report, which was compiled in a short period, gave an opportunity to the committee to involve itself in substantial detailed work.  If it is not allowed to continue with that, it will never reach a conclusion.  The issue of electoral changes has been a source of debate since I entered this House.  Four previous Taoisigh have said the most significant issue they believe should be addressed by committees is the electoral issue, but we never seem to get around to it.  I would <Col N="308" /> like to see a constitutional review committee do that, even if it took ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify something because I think the Taoiseach misunderstood what I said.  I did not suggest that the wording of the Amsterdam Treaty referendum should have been referred to the committee.  I pointed out in relation to the Referendum Bill that the work of the committee in the operation of referenda was disregarded.  That is a separate issue.  The Taoiseach is absolutely correct about the wording and absolutely wrong about the Referendum Bill.</P>

The reports state that business generally, public administration or otherwise, should not underestimate the year 2000 problem.

In the new year, the currency changeover board will devise a comprehensive information campaign for all sectors of the economy and the issue of what timescale will be used will then be considered by the board.</P>

      <P>My Department chairs the IFSC Clearing House Group which undertakes a co-ordinating role in relation to the development of the IFSC.  In addition, three specialised working groups meet under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The clearing house group and the working groups include representatives of relevant Government Departments and State agencies, including the Department of the Taoiseach, as well as members of the financial services industry in the IFSC.  In addition, subgroups may meet on an informal basis to deal with particular issues.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Finance Bill does not contain proposals to deal with allegations of fairly widespread tax evasion by non-resident companies using the IFSC, will the Taoiseach ask the relevant committees under the aegis of his Department whether it would be a good idea to introduce special legislation to deal with this problem in advance of next year's Finance Bill? Waiting for the Bill would allow another year to pass in which these concerns hang in the air, potentially doing considerable damage to our reputation.</P>

      <P>The IFSC working group has been revamped recently and now includes a number of international seniors with the other groups. For some time that committee has been concerned with these matters and has done a considerable amount of work.  It is more than anxious to give its advice and assistance on whatever changes are necessary.  It has been warning about these issues since 1994.  Many of the issues raised are not within the remit of the IFSC companies and this concerns the committee.  It has an interest in making sure that these issues are properly regulated and is concerned that we make any changes which are required.  I will ensure that this happens.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that one of the reasons the IFSC committees have been placed under the aegis of his Department is that the reports can be passed to a Department which has a co-ordinating role across the range of departments?  In view of this would the Taoiseach <Col N="311" /> consider that it would be useful to ask the committees for recommendations on short-term action to deal with the concerns about tax evasion by non-resident companies with a view to such action being taken in special legislation to be enacted this year rather than waiting until next year's Finance Bill?</P>

I do not have to ensure that the committees propose changes as I know they are already doing so.  I met the IFSC committee in the autumn and again at Christmas. It will put forward suggestions and give any assistance it can to the Minister for Finance to make sure that these issues are dealt with.

My Department is involved in the issues covered by these groups such as the NESF and NESC on which I regularly answer questions in the House.  I do not consider the taxi forum a delaying tactic.  We might get somewhere as a result of it.  Efforts have been wasted during the past few years because we have not managed to resolve the issue.  The only way we will resolve it is by recognising the reality.  Every time this issue is examined people ignore the fact that there are more people than taxis.  Cosies, hackneys and other operators are now taking a bigger slice of the business.  People also take the view that taxi drivers with full plates have no <Col N="313" /> rights.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for monitoring and co-ordinating the management of child abuse cases rests with the health boards as part of their statutory responsibilities under the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
      <P>The procedures followed by health boards in investigating alleged cases of child abuse are in accordance with the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987 and the 1995 procedures for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and the Garda.  I recently established a working group to review existing guidelines and to prepare revised guidelines aimed at improving the identification, investigation and management of child abuse. The working group, which is representative of all the relevant interested parties, held its first meeting this week and is due to report to me within a year.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the number of reported cases of child abuse has increased steadily over the past eight years.  For example, in 1987 the Eastern Health Board received 793 reports of child abuse whereas the figure for 1996 was more than 2,300.  This has led to a system of prioritisation whereby the most urgent cases are handled first.  The Eastern Health Board has assured me that all cases requiring an urgent response are dealt with without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> In other cases an initial assessment is undertaken and reports may also be required from other agencies, including child abuse assessment units or child psychiatric services, before a decision about the appropriate type of intervention can be made.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is currently engaged in a number of strategic initiatives which will result in a standardised approach to assessment procedures, a definition of case priorities, estimating need and the determination of closure criteria.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the exact number as the numbers change from day to day and it is difficult for the Eastern Health Board to provide up to date figures.  At present the board is completing work on the figures for 1997.  I am assured all cases are dealt with as expeditiously as possible and that those which require urgent attention receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is not aware of the number of alleged abuse cases in respect of children &mdash; they are not just figures &mdash; in the Eastern Health Board area, is he aware of the number awaiting investigation as of 31 December 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures for 1997 have not yet been fully compiled by the health board. However, I assure the Deputy that the number of cases awaiting investigation have fallen by comparison to last year's figures and those of the previous year.  We are making significant progress in dealing more effectively with the number of cases.  A report by Kieran McGrath, a prominent social worker and journalist, said in July 1997 that in the previous year there were up to 1,000 such cases.  I assure the Deputy that the figure has decreased significantly since then as a result of extra resources and initiatives taken by the Government since coming into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this because of the continuous discussion and monitoring I undertake with the programme manager, social workers and chief executive officer of the health board.  They have satisfied me that, while they do not have the statistics, they are continuously improving their <Col N="320" /> ability to deal quickly and more effectively with cases and that the number of cases outstanding are continuously decreasing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The urgent cases of child sex abuse are dealt with immediately.  All cases are assessed and those with less priority are brought into the examination system and are carefully monitored. While there is much pressure on the staff of the Eastern Health Board and while there are outstanding cases, I am quite satisfied that an effort above the norm is being made by the staff to get to grips with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the level of monitoring why is the Minister scandalously and blissfully ignorant of the number of outstanding reports of child physical and sexual abuse and neglect awaiting investigation by the eastern or other health boards?  Can the Minister explain why the Taoiseach told the House three weeks ago that 1,000 cases are awaiting investigation?  Did the Taoiseach invent this figure or was he furnished with it by the Minister?  Will the Minister indicate how the health board prioritises cases of alleged child abuse or neglect given that no assessment or visit is made to the child or the family at the time of prioritisation?  Does the Minister acknowledge that there are hundreds of children at risk in the Eastern Health Board area due to the staff of the board being overwhelmed, and that these children will remain at risk while the Minister waffles in response to questions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The professional staff of the Eastern Health Board assess cases of abuse as they arise using the very good system in operation. A visit is immediately undertaken if necessary. I am assured the serious cases which warrant immediate investigation, intervention and treatment are dealt with speedily and effectively. Other cases of less importance are immediately assessed and may be referred to other agencies for additional&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Assessment is carried out by professional social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, <Col N="321" /> doctors and public health nurses to ensure that any risks to children are immediately dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are assessed in a professional manner by the people I mentioned.  A visit to somebody's house is not necessarily required for every assessment.  As the Deputy wishes to be confrontational and, perhaps, political, it should be noted that much of the problem results from the reduction of additional funding for dealing with child abuse from £10 million in 1986 to £5 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>It created a major crisis for the Eastern Health Board in particular when it reduced by half the amount of money provided.  I have increased the amount of money provided in 1998 by £13 million. That is in addition to £2 million I received from the Minister for Finance to deal with the immediate crisis I faced when I came into office.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Shatter wants to be political and not address the real issues, I will deal with him on that basis.  He should be concerned about the real problems facing the Eastern Health Board and indeed other boards throughout the country. There are children at risk who are abused and neglected.  The system is pressurised to a greater degree than it should in dealing with those but we are currently involved in a comprehensive programme to deal with that problem, and I ask Deputy Shatter to be a little more responsible in that regard.  He should not throw around figures and make a political football out of this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my final supplementary.  It is a very serious issue.  I will not delay the House by engaging in a figures argument which is inaccurate.  The Minister of State knows the figures he has just given are not accurate.  Is he aware of the fact that he is dealing with children who are at risk?  Is he telling the House, as the Minister with special responsibility for children, that he does not know the number of reports of child abuse that have been made to health boards, and particularly the Eastern Health Board which has a major difficulty, that currently await assessment and investigation?  The Minister of State has told the House he does not know the number awaiting assessment and investigation at the end of 1997.  Is he telling the House he is currently reliant on figures going back to December 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State explain how all the professionals, including doctors, social workers and community nurses, can determine a list of priorities as to which child and family should be assessed based on phone call reports of abuse to <Col N="322" /> health boards or brief reports from school teachers or other people?  How can that priority system work?  Will the Minister of State acknowledge that there are currently hundreds of reports made, particularly to the Eastern Health Board, in respect of which there has not been a single social worker visit, or a visit from any other health board professional, to a family, the person who made the report, where their identity has been revealed, or to the child to determine the degree to which the child is at risk?  Will he accept it is his responsibility to rectify that?  The Minister of State must first get the information and the facts with regard to children and what now must be done to address the crisis in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems being experienced by the Eastern Health Board in particular is that its information systems are not as modernised as they should be &mdash; that exercise is currently being undertaken &mdash; and as a result it cannot provide more up-to-date statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have addressed this issue and we have been in constant discussion with the Eastern Health Board about it.  New equipment is being put in place that will give us the up-to-date statistical information we require, but that is different from the position regarding the cases currently being dealt with on a day to day basis by the board.  My officials and I are in regular contact with the board's senior management to monitor carefully its assessment of cases.  I am reassured that every case of reported child sexual abuse is properly investigated and that the professionalism of the social workers and other people in the board is without question.  In fact, the professionalism of the board's staff, particularly its social workers, is the best I have found in any of the professions I have dealt with since I became involved in politics.  It should be remembered that those social workers are dealing with traumatic cases.  We are horrified to read about those cases in the papers but these young social workers, some of whom are not long out of college, have to deal with them on a daily basis.  That is a difficult and traumatic experience for them. In fact, one of the problems currently being experienced by the Eastern Health Board is that it has several vacant positions for social workers which it is unable to fill.  Notwithstanding those difficulties, which we cannot resolve with the magic wand Deputy Shatter is waving, I am satisfied that every case is dealt with promptly and adequately.  It is correct that in many cases a visit to the family involved does not take place as quickly as it should.  There are outstanding cases.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that the report of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child is a damning indictment of our child care services?  The committee highlighted 17 different areas about which it has serious concern in regard to our child care services and made substantial recommendations in that regard.  Does the Minister of State accept those recommendations, in particular the final recommendation which is probably the most significant, namely, the need for the Government to initiate a debate among the public and in this Parliament on all the reports emanating from that hearing?  The Minister of State referred to some plans he has in this regard but placing a copy of the report in the Oireachtas Library is hopelessly inadequate in the context of generating a national debate on this issue.  Does the Minister of State propose to put the report into the public arena? It is not sufficient to say that it is hoped to have a debate in the future.  Is the Minister prepared to give evidence of his commitment to seriously tackling this issue and to adopting a rights based approach to child care issues?</P>
      <P>If that is the case, surely the Minister will want to have the matter debated in the Dáil at the earliest possible date.  Will he give a commitment that he will arrange Government time for a Dáil debate on the report?</P>

      <P>A Dáil debate will take place on the issue in the very near future.  The first Irish report to the United Nations was a significant report.  It did not try to show that we are the best at looking after the needs of our children.  It was a realistic report prepared in consultation with NGOs, which had a significant input.  Consequently, it was a balanced report which outlined the difficulties in addition to the great achievements we have made.  I do not accept that the response to the report was damning, but it highlighted many areas where we are not up to speed in terms of children's rights and protection, which was welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publicity that surrounded the presentation of the report in Geneva and the points made in response outlined many areas which must receive priority.  I am committed to carefully studying the report and implementing the recommendations made by the UN committee.  In the area of child care there is in place a three year programme for the millennium to improve considerably child care services.  All Departments are involved in a national strategy to improve the lot of children. We are committed to highlighting the report and the provisions of the UN Convention.  I have allocated to the Children's Rights Alliance an initial <Col N="325" /> £100,000 for a publicity campaign to highlight the provisions of the convention and the responses made to those provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a number of Departments are involved in a national strategy on child care.  Since I am not aware of a strategy on child care, are those Departments engaged in preparing such a strategy?  If there is such a strategy will the Minister make it available to Members?  Will he give a commitment that the matter will be put on the agenda of this House? If we are serious about tackling this issue &mdash; we should be ashamed little progress has been made over the years and there are many gaps in the service &mdash; will the Minister give a commitment to approach the Cabinet with a view to making available Government time during this Dáil session to debate this important report?</P>

      <P>The answer to the last part of the question is yes.  I cannot display my commitment to significant improvement in the rights of children much more than I have done in the past seven months.  I have made every effort to highlight with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children the inadequacies of the system.  I have succeeded in getting increased resources in the child care area, but there is need for a greater increase in resources.</P>

Since I was appointed I have been involved with three Departments, the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in co-ordinating in a practical way our approach to the difficulties, particularly of disadvantaged children and children who are out of control and have behavioural problems.  We are putting in place practical programmes, of which I will announce details in the next week.  A number of other issues are involved in the strategy.  The Deputy is right in that up to now there has not been a clearly defined strategy for children.  I am putting together such a strategy and working to build on the plan for the millennium. I got agreement from Government for significant extra staffing, which was a major difficulty for me, to enable a cross-departmental team up to assistant secretary level to become involved in a significant move to put in place and implement this strategy.</P>

My officials are monitoring the litigation in the United States and other jurisdictions and when the group reports to me I will make a determination on the matter.  On providing direct financial assistance for private citizens who are instituting or have instituted civil court proceedings against tobacco companies, I have decided that to follow such a course of action in respect of every individual case or firm which applies would constitute an inefficient use of public funds and could give rise to certain inequities.

The group comprises senior administrative medical and legal personnel in the health services as follows: Mr. Tom Mooney, assistant secretary in the Department, Dr. J.

Could the Minister explain why there is no representative of the Attorney General's office on the committee which has been established?</P>

      <P>The legal adviser of my Department will liaise with the Attorney General's office regarding legal aspects of this issue.  It is an advisory group the purpose of which is to set out a preliminary position and provide an assessment as to what the position might be.  As I stated at the previous Question Time, the issue has not been addressed at departmental or governmental level.  It is now being sought to be addressed because of the issues in the US referred to by the Deputy and the ability to recoup funds from the tobacco industry.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the complexity of the legal issues involved and I do not underestimate the power of the tobacco industry to seek to defend its position. Following inquiries made in the course of the previous Question Time, an advisory group will shortly provide me with a preliminary assessment of the situation.  At that stage I will be in a position to decide on what further steps need to be taken and to decide if there is a capacity to bring such an action and whether or not it would be in the public interest to do so.  To my knowledge, no jurisdiction in the EU has brought such an action.  It is something we should monitor and seek to advance at a wider European level to ensure the necessary muscle to contend with the issues that will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific figures; I will seek to obtain approximations.  Two of the three biggest killers in Ireland are cancer and cardio-vascular disease.  There is definite and scientific proof of the link between smoking and cancer, especially lung cancer.  Smoking is also a major contributing factor to cardiovascular disease.  It is a major issue and apart from trying to deal with the consequences of people suffering from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the question of prevention and cardiovascular health is part of the strategy I recently announced whereby we will improve the infrastructure for the provision of cardiac care facilities.  I have also established a <Col N="328" /> group which will look at the preventive side and I hope it will report to me by the end of June.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept that there is a need for a more dynamic approach by the Government to considering litigation of this nature?  Would he also agree that he should effectively declare war on the tobacco companies, as I have asked him to do on previous occasions? Would he agree that it is time for his Department to make it clear to the tobacco companies that their behaviour is unacceptable?  Will he not acknowledge that it would be good use of public resources to instigate litigation to recoup the public expenditure incurred on medical care for the casualties of the tobacco industry?  Would he not accept that by his refusal to provide any financial back-up, assistance or legal assistance to individuals who are taking the tobacco companies to court he is abdicating a role, leaving them in the firing line and asking them to take on the tobacco companies when the State is a much more powerful organ to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree.  It is the Deputy's opinion that we lack dynamism.  Given the total inaction in this area prior to the Government taking office, I do not know how he would describe the performance of my predecessor, his colleague in Government.  At least we are now seeking to address the issue.</P>
      <P>I am proceeding with caution and will await an assessment of the issue.  If there is a prospect of success and we can mount a challenge I am prepared to consider the matter.  The Deputy is aware that many factors will be involved in that assessment.</P>
      <P>Requests to the State to finance privately instituted proceedings by individuals are a relatively recent phenomenon.  It is one to which, on principle and in the main, I would not always accede because the State will make its own assessment and, if it wishes, will bring proceedings on the basis of advice from its chief legal officers and not outside advisers.  It is a matter for them and their clients if, in their assessment, they can best defend the interests of their clients by taking private proceedings.</P>
      <P>There have recently been a couple of instances of this phenomenon which have not shown the legal profession in a good light, although I do not suggest that is the case regarding the two firms involved in these proceedings.  Recently attempts have been made to position the State to involve itself in paying and bankrolling private proceedings taken by private law firms on behalf of private individuals.  That is not the function of the State.  The State will determine the best thing to do in all the circumstances in its own way and its own time, based on its own public interest considerations. If there are prospects of success and if the risk involved is justified by the facts I would be prepared to consider taking it.  However, it would be remiss of anybody to think it is a simple assessment that can be taken overnight; it cannot.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer strategy, published in November 1996, is aimed at providing an integrated, comprehensive set of cancer treatment services comprising surgery, oncology and radiotherapy.  The strategy was developed and agreed following an extensive process of consultation involving experts and organisations working in the field of cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care.</P>
      <P>The strategy includes a plan for reorganising cancer treatment services around three supra-regional centres in which all of the major treatments for cancer will be available.  Linked to the supra-regional centres will be a set of regional services in designated hospitals which will each provide a multi-disciplinary cancer service for patients within its area.  Patients requiring more specialised services, including radiotherapy, will be referred to the appropriate supra-regional service.</P>
      <P>The focus of the strategy is to provide comprehensive services in a designated set of high quality centres.  The centralisation of all cancer treatment services in any one institution would be expensive and cumbersome and would not necessarily be to the benefit of patients, especially in terms of access to services.  Instead, the strategy promotes close co-operation and co-ordination of services between hospitals and the development of regional self-sufficiency in appropriate specialties. I believe that the cancer strategy adopts the best practical approach in this regard.  It emphasises the development of best practice and the promotion of agreement at local level as to which hospital is best placed to provide each type of cancer treatment.</P>
      <P>An action plan to implement the strategy was announced in March 1997 by my predecessor.  It included details of a national cancer forum to advise on implementation of the strategy and it announced the appointment of regional directors of cancer services for each area.  The regional directors are making considerable progress already thanks to their commitment and the hard work of many others in the field of cancer prevention and treatment.  The directors are currently drawing up regional plans for the development of services in their respective areas which are being funded by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to implementing the strategy <Col N="330" /> as set out in the action plan.  This year I provided £7.7 million for implementing the strategy, which is an addition to the £6 million provided for this purpose in 1997.  In addition to this investment, £1 million was allocated in 1997 and again this year for the development of a national breast screening programme.  The screening process is due to commence next September.  A pilot programme of cervical screening is also in preparation in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  I allocated £300,000 to this important project this year.</P>
    <P>I have also provided the necessary funding for providing new consultant based services throughout the country in oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.  This will be implemented on a phased basis over the next few years and will ensure reasonable self-sufficiency to the greatest possible extent consistent with the provision of high quality services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the lack of uniform access to services in addition to the absence of structured screening programmes and protocols for general practitioners and hospital doctors governing when and to whom patients suspected of having cancer should be referred, are reasons for the high death rate in Ireland from breast and ovarian cancer?  Does he acknowledge it is unacceptable that proportionally twice as many women in this State die of breast cancer compared to the United States of America?  Does he acknowledge that 41 out of every 100 women in Ireland who develop breast cancer lose their lives to the illness compared to 21 out of every 100 women in the United States?  In the context of the implementation of his plan, at what stage does the Minister consider these figures will radically improve and the same level of care available to women suffering from cancer in the United States will be provided in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the purpose of the national cancer strategy is to address the issues he raised.  Its purpose is to provide equity of access to services in one's locality, to provide regional self-sufficiency and the necessary specialist care on an equitable basis.  The model being used arose from an extensive consultative process undertaken by my predecessor.  It has the support of all the specialists and their representative bodies.  A specialist recently suggested a different model involving a centralised cancer treatment service.  However, this model did not have the unanimous support of the specialist's representative body and others involved in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to redesign the entire health service delivery model.  The service has developed since the foundation of the State and there must be co-ordination at local level to ensure the best possible care is provided.  My confidence in the strategy is based on the confidence of the specialists who are working co-operatively to implement <Col N="331" /> it in full.  I commend my predecessor, as I have done previously, for bringing forward the strategy. It is an excellent approach and there will be definite improvements in the mortality rates mentioned by the Deputy once it is implemented.</P>
    <P>There have not been proper screening services in the past.  The breast screening service will begin in the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and involve the 50-64 age group, which is the highest risk category.  It will cover half the national cohort when it begins in September.  It was correct to ensure that the information systems were in place and that the population register was properly considered before screening began.  From experience in Britain, we are aware that speedy implementation of screening can bring about false positives and negatives and even greater trauma than the absence of screening itself.</P>
    <P>There has been caution but there has also been prudence and professionalism.  There is confidence that this matter is being dealt with correctly. I acknowledge, in the absence of a strategy until now, that our mortality rates are higher than we would wish.  The Deputy referred to the US which is probably the gold standard in success in this area.  However, success involves resources and the level of specialist care and research facilities that are available.  I acknowledge the statistical basis of the Deputy's comments but proceeding with the implementation of the strategy, as planned by the previous Administration, is the best way forward and has the best prospect of success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister envisage that breast and cervical screening programmes will become national operations as opposed to initial programmes?  Does the Minister accept that until such time as they are national and not regional programmes, the death rates from cancer will continue to be unacceptably high?</P>
      <P>In light of new research that became available recently, will the Minister re-examine the need for a prostate screening programme?  Such a programme was deemed unfeasible initially but it now appears more feasible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make inquires regarding the Deputy's second point about the prospect of a screening programme for prostate cancer.</P>
      <P>National screening will begin in the absence of any database in this area.  The first programme is not a pilot programme in that it will cover half the people who need to be screened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is within a limited age group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A Swedish expert at a recent conference on this matter indicated that that age group is regarded medically as giving the best cost benefit.  Younger age cohorts could be screened, but there is no evidence that the incidence of cancer would be detected earlier or lowered as a <Col N="332" /> result.  The Swedes have been to the forefront in this area and cost benefit analyses determine the position.</P>
      <P>Once the first screening programme has been set up, the population registers in the other areas will then be considered.  This is the way to proceed. If we were to wait until a national database was ready, it would not be possible to start anything in September this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister correctly recognises the importance of screening and early detection for all cancers.  It is regrettable that it is necessary to take a pilot project based approach to smear testing.  Until there is a national screening project for cervical cancer, what is the justification for excluding smear tests from the medical card scheme?  This is a huge gap in the service.  People with medical cards must pay for smear tests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are smear tests not included in the services that are free of charge under the medical scheme?  What is the justification for this disincentive to people to present for screening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy a detailed and considered reply if she tables a question on that matter.  Funds have been devoted this year to dealing with the delays in producing smear test results.  This was a priority because results were not becoming available quickly enough.  Funds were provided for improved resources and staffing.</P>
      <P>In the absence of a systematic approach until now, it is obvious that we must have the correct database and information and IT systems.  We do not want false negatives or to ultimately undo the good envisioned by the strategy.  Regarding Deputy Shatter's comments, it has taken two years to get the breast screening programme up and running in the three health board areas.  It will take a year or 18 months to formulate a population register for the rest of the country. This might be more difficult because it will involve more health boards and much more disparate populations where people may not be as readily available as they are in urban settings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should acknowledge that the strategy began under the previous Administration.  There is now a strategic approach to screening and the development of cancer services.  Much good work is being done and the resources, as set out in the plan, are being accorded.  We should acknowledge the progress being made.  Cancer is a major killer disease and political Administrations of <Col N="333" /> every hue would give this area the top priority it deserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The national cancer strategy includes provision for the introduction of breast cancer screening on a phased basis for women aged 50 to 64.  Phase I will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis was not based on financial constraints.  Instead, it is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and the importance of ensuring that the Irish programme meets the necessary quality assurance criteria.  Specifically, the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Health, I am very much aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. For this reason the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
      <P>To this end, a national steering committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer, Western Health Board, was established in March 1997 to manage and oversee the implementation of phase I of the programme. In addition, a national quality assurance committee has been established under the chairmanship of Professor Joe Ennis, who was the director of the Eccles Street Pilot Screening Programme. The quality assurance committee, which is a sub-committee of the national steering committee, is charged with the responsibility for drawing up protocols for the programme to ensure it meets the necessary quality assurance criteria.</P>

    <P>To start screening by I September 1998, it is critical that all the quality assurance requirements are satisfied.  In this regard, I am pleased that considerable progress has been made on the development of the clinical and administrative systems and on the establishment of a national population register.  It is expected that the appointment of <Col N="334" /> the project director will be finalised in the near future.</P>
    <P>In terms of identifying an appropriate model of delivery for the programme, the key concern in this regard was the need to achieve acceptable compliance levels and at the same time to meet the necessary quality assurance criteria.  After careful deliberation and much discussion on the issue, the decision was made to develop two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's hospitals, where the screening, assessment and treatment will be carried out, using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the key clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist.  In addition, two mobile units will bring the screening services to the women in the more remote or rural areas within the three health boards in Phase I. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the decisions to date in relation to phase I of the programme are very much in line with international quality assurance standards and best practice.  I reiterate that my Department is committed to making the necessary capital and revenue resources available for the successful implementation of the programme.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to believe that it will not begin in September as planned.  The appointment of a project director is now being finalised.  Interviews were held in November and December.  The successful applicant is Dr. Jane Buttimer, the deputy chief medical officer of the Department of Health.  It is now a matter of deciding who the employer is &mdash; whether it is the North Eastern Health Board or an independent agency under the remit of this programme.  There is a secondment issue to be sorted out.  I am informed that it is being finalised at the moment.</P>

      <P>I referred to neutrality before the adjournment of the debate.  There is no wish that this country should become part of some superpower quelling insurrections around the world. However, we must recognise that we have obligations. We are part of the European Union and have the same rights and entitlements as each other country in that Union.  We will also have obligations in relation to each aspect of the Union.  That does not mean we do not have choices: we do.</P>
      <P>In 1972 and 1973 we had the choice of joining the EEC.  We could have stayed out but that would not have been such a wise idea.  There have been other opportunities to move in that direction since, that we have not taken, for the same reason.  We must have a debate for the public that will be based on fact rather than fiction.  We must also have a debate that will extend into the future.  The EU will not stay at its present size.  It is bound to be enlarged, even if that is not immediately relevant to this debate.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that although we speak as Irish people, we also speak as Europeans.  Some years ago there was a debate as to whether certain eastern European countries should be permitted to join the EU.  One of them asked why it should be permitted to enter when, after all, it was in Europe.  It was not in the EU but it was part of Europe.  We should all remember that.</P>
      <P>I hope that there is some time before this referendum to give people time to reflect on the maximum amount of information available before voting.</P>
      <P>We must also let our European colleagues know that we are a good member of the Union, but we cannot be taken for granted.  This is particularly important as more small nations are likely to join.  The integration of a number of small nations of similar size, influence and economic impact will benefit the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Maastricht referendum many negative points of view were put forward as a scare tactic.  It was suggested that if one voted for Maastricht one voted for the abolition of the Central Bank and political control at Government level.  That was misleading and, in turn, proved beneficial to countries who at that time were considering diverting from the European <Col N="337" /> course.  Some countries are still on that course, but I hope they will not remain on it. Unfortunately, the information that was peddled around freely in countries that were not 100 per cent disposed towards Europe at that time was used as a lever to oppose Maastricht in this country. I hope that does not happen in the run-up to the forthcoming referendum.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the co-operation that exists between member states, Europe is not indestructible. In this debate we should target our comments towards solidifying, as opposed to fragmenting, the European theme.  I will not mention particular member states, but some appear to have had second and third thoughts at present, which is not good for Europe.</P>
    <P>The concept of renationalisation has reemerged. Having read our history we should all know that concept caused incredible suffering in terms of lives and economics in the past.  It was the one thing of which the founding fathers of the modern Europe were conscious when they established the European Coal and Steel Community many years ago.  If the question of renationalisation and the introduction of incentives, supports, barriers and tariffs emerges at some stage in the future, there is no sense talking about an integrated Europe.  That would mean going off on a tangent for which we would pay a big price. Those who favour the European concept should note that we have contributed constructively to an integrated Europe, but we have also benefited considerably.  We have put European money to good use and we are a shining example to other countries that wish to join.</P>
    <P>Those are only a few of the items that need to be borne in mind in the run-up to the referendum. It behoves all of us to ensure the people we represent are fully informed and in possession of soundly based positive information so that they can make a decision in their own interest and in the interest of the European Union, irrespective of its size.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to support the Bill in line with the proposed wording of Article 29.4.6 which will be put forward on Committee Stage.  That wording states:</P>
      <P>The State may exercise the options or discretions provided by or under Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.15 of the Treaty referred to in subsection 5 of this section and in the second and fourth Protocols set out in the said treaty but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The proposed wording of Article 29.4.5 shall remain unchanged from that published in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is agreement on this wording.  I am pleased we are not entering a divisive debate on the Amsterdam Treaty.  If it became a party political issue on which we could not reach agreement, it could prove detrimental for this important referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> I formally welcome the fact that the retired Chief Justice Finlay, Senior Counsel, has been appointed to chair the referendum commission. As he has proved in the past, he will be an excellent chairman.  It is difficult to ensure the debate is balanced and that both sides of the argument are put forward to give the public an opportunity to study the implications of the proposal.  A large number of people voted against the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality and many others purposely spoilt their votes.  I have rarely seen such a large number of people showing such annoyance at a referendum.  The comments on ballot papers showed that we failed to get the message across.  Politicians were blamed for not making sure the public was informed.  We can speak as often as we like on a matter, but unless what we are trying to convey gets across in the media, the general public will not be aware of the arguments being made.  That difficulty must be overcome in this case.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to get people involved in the debate, but at least the commission can ensure that a full and proper debate takes place.  It was only in the lead up to the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality that opposition to the proposal became clear.  Given that the opposition was late the referendum received much publicity in the final four or five days.  It was difficult to counteract the opposition and to give an objective viewpoint on what was being said.</P>
    <P>This Bill which deals with the Amsterdam Treaty is important.  During our Presidency the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and the Government played a major role in drafting the treaty. Therefore, it is essential that those on this side who helped to draft the treaty support it and work with the Government on this important national issue, the approval of this referendum.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority and a political party I travel extensively.  Irrespective of whether we like it, there is a body of opinion which has much criticism of Europe.  Members of the European Parliament, members of the Commission and everyone involved in politics, who are committed to Europe, have a duty to put forward ideas and highlight the positive aspects arising from our membership of the EU.  I do not want to do a total PR job but if there are difficulties they should be highlighted.</P>
    <P>Many people are sick and tired of decisions taken in Europe.  When promoting the terms of the proposed amendment to the Constitution public representatives will travel through cities and towns and will face major criticism about what is happening to free trade, particularly the export of goods to Britain.  That is a major source of irritation for many but especially for the farming community.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we had a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign for which we received much criticism from Europe and, due to pressure, was discontinued. In the high streets of the larger cities and towns in Britain slogans of the Union Jack, &ldquo;Be British&rdquo;, &ldquo;Think British, Buy British&rdquo; are openly displayed. <Col N="339" /> Our &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign was simple and did not involve the use of flags or emblems. This campaign is causing much concern and certainly our exports to Britain are hampered, especially for beef and lamb.  There is a problem also in relation to exports of lamb to France. When one gets off the ferry in any part of England one will see huge bales of hay on which advertisements state: &ldquo;Buy British Beef&rdquo;.  This is an issue which the European Union should have examined.</P>
    <P>The Refuse Act requires larger centres for refuse collection and a number of refuse centres have closed throughout the country.  Those which remain open will be full in a short period and there will be nowhere to put refuse.  If an attempt is made to reopen refuse centres, or dumps, there will be major opposition.  The theory is brilliant but the practice is appalling.  It costs a great deal to get rid of rubbish and this is a growing problem.</P>
    <P>Another example of interference by Europe relates to abattoirs.  The Abattoirs Act has led to the closure of numerous butcher shops in villages, towns and cities for the reason that they conducted their own slaughtering of animals and so on and were continuously harassed by local authorities and health boards.  The bottom line is that the supermarkets are getting bigger.  The meat is pre-packaged in all types of foil, etc., and the customer has to buy what is on display.  In the past the butcher knew what his customer wanted and was able to provide a quality product.  Most of those butcher shops have now closed with the loss of many jobs.</P>
    <P>We may talk about Goldsmith's Deserted Village or the ploughman homeward plodding his weary way.  If we continue as we are even the ploughman will not be plodding his weary way.  I am alarmed at what is happening in regard to the depopulation of our villages and towns.  It is every bit as bad as Charlestown which was written about by a famous writer many years ago.  People are being pushed into the larger towns and cities which are unable to cope with what is happening. This results in the depopulation of our rural areas and it is a serious matter.  This results in congestion in towns and is part and parcel of the reason house prices are spiralling.</P>
    <P>There are numerous problems throughout the country under the REPS and other schemes.  Various studies and reports have been produced. Given the way in which European policy is directed, they have the effect of closing down many established businesses which needed support. Many towns and villages are affected as a result.</P>
    <P>In the Bill we are dealing with emigration and the movement of persons.  I am sad at our approach to emigration and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>It concerns me that, on arrival by plane or boat, those who look European are allowed through while those from Africa or Asia are stopped.  I hope we will be more generous to genuine asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> I am pleased that in some areas at least we will be able to opt out of the provisions of the Treaty. On the common foreign and security policy, although we are neutral, we should make our voice heard in Europe, the United Nations and elsewhere.  It concerns me that some of our European partners have sold arms and other deadly weapons to countries such as Iraq and Iran for use against their neighbours.  We should not allow our name to be sullied in this way.  We should highlight this issue on a regular basis at the United Nations to curtail the massive profits being made from the production of arms.  The weaponry developed in the United States and Britain was the subject of a recent Channel 4 programme by Mr. Jon Snow.  It made frightening viewing.  We should make our voice heard to ensure a halt is called.  I support the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government parties appear to be following a policy of masterful silence.  I am astonished that more of them do not have a contribution to make.</P>
      <P>The matters contained in the Amsterdam Treaty have been the subject of wide debate in the media, the parliaments of the member states and among some sections of the public in the past two years.  The Governments of the member states took to heart, happily, some of the lessons learned during the debate on the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.  As a result the preparation of this treaty has been much more open to public and parliamentary scrutiny than any previous treaty since Ireland joined the European Economic Community in 1973.  The treaty was prepared by a reflection group and an intergovernmental conference. The work of those two bodies was much more widely debated than any previous European treaty.  Unfortunately, this is not reflected in much of the media comment about the Amsterdam Treaty.  The media appear to be following the same process and policy of silent abstention and absence as the Government parties.</P>
      <P>I find it astonishing that some of the same media commentators who wrote and spoke at length and, in some cases, with great insight about the work of the reflection group and the intergovernmental conference are among the people who say there is not enough information available to the public about the treaty and that there has not been an adequate debate so far. They are giving a twist to the debate which is entirely unjustified.  I invite the media commentators to look at their files going back to the beginning of the work of the reflection group to see how much public debate there has been about the issues dealt with in the treaty, the preparation of which was much more open to public scrutiny than any previous European treaty in the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the honour of chairing the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs during the time the treaty was being prepared.  I pay tribute to the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the staff of the Department <Col N="341" /> of Foreign Affairs for their readiness to discuss the issues with that committee and the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  When the issues were delicate, they told us they were delicate and when they were complex, they told us how complex they were.  Those discussions were mutually beneficial to the Houses of the Oireachtas and to those involved on our behalf in the preparation of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I pay a personal tribute to all the public servants who were involved in this work.  Those officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments served our country extremely well in their application to this work.  Because he is now retired from the public service I can safely say without breaking any parliamentary privilege that we owe a particular debt of gratitude to Mr. Noel Dorr who played a central role in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Government must soon make a decision about the date on which the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty will take place.  We all hope that we will have cause to have another referendum before too long on a set of proposals that will bring peace to the island, Northern Ireland in particular, and lay the foundations for an enterprise in which all the people on the island can co-operate and to which they can give their allegiance.  The Taoiseach said that referendum will take place on a date later than that targeted by the United Kingdom Government.  I believe he is right and would not be surprised if it takes place even later than the Taoiseach expects.  The referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty should take place before that referendum or, at the latest, at the same time.  My preference would be to have the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty at the earliest possible moment.  Although there are differing views in the House, it would be useful to have the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty before 1 May, if possible.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate to create a situation in which we might have a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty that would be influenced principally by arguments about the entry rate of the punt to the euro, a matter that has nothing to do with the Amsterdam Treaty but arises from decisions made when we ratified the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.  The arguments in favour of an early referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty are far more persuasive than the arguments for delaying it, although I accept they have validity.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty, which has nothing to do with the euro, were to be a debate on whether we had made the right decision on the entry rate of the punt into the euro.  That will be the danger if this referendum is held later than 1 May.  There are other arguments, but the arguments in favour of having an earlier referendum are far more persuasive than those for delaying it.</P>
    <P>The Government produced a useful White Paper on the treaty and another document, a summary of it, which is a reprint of section 2 of it.  The Government's original intention was to <Col N="342" /> produce 200,000 copies of the summary and to distribute it through public libraries and other public outlets.  I urge the Taoiseach to increase the print order because it is a useful document. We should make sure that at least one of those documents is sent to every household.  It does not take a great deal of ingenuity to find ways to ensure that is done.</P>
    <P>Having noted, with approval, the publication of the White Paper and the summary document, I find fault with the Government, particularly the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for one part of the presentation set out in the White Paper and for the effects it has had on the initial public presentation of the issues in relation to the common foreign and security policy which are among the less important provisions in this treaty.  Paragraph 15.50 of the White Paper states correctly that any move to integrate the Western European Union into the European Union would require in the EU, convening a new intergovernmental conference, an amendment to the treaties necessitating, in turn, a referendum in this country.  That is accurately set out in that paragraph.  Although I do not know if it is deliberate, it is curious that the word &ldquo;referendum&rdquo; does not appear in that paragraph, even though that is clearly what is meant.  By contrast, paragraph 15.49 of the White Paper deals with the adoption of a common defence policy.  It points out correctly that the Government, like the two previous Governments, has stated that whether or not such a decision would require an amendment to the Constitution it would be put to the people for decision in a referendum.  That is a factual statement of the case, but it is not a complete statement.  A complete statement would go on to say that, irrespective of the commitment given by this Government and by its two predecessors, the adoption of a common defence policy by the European Union would clearly involve a further amendment of the treaties and would therefore require a referendum to be held regardless of the commitment that was given.  That presentation in the White Paper and the subsequent lack of any change in that by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, has been a serious error and has damaged the presentation of the persuasive case for the ratification of this treaty.  The omission of a clear statement of this kind from the White Paper led to a spin being put on the presentation by the media at the time of its publication.  I am not critical of the media in this instance but that spin created unnecessary uncertainty and it gave another opportunity to those who oppose ratification to put forward spurious arguments and to raise unfounded fears that are not in any way helpful to the presentation of the reality of this treaty to the people.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill to the House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated his intention to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to clarify the extent of the options and discretions referred to in the second paragraph of Part II of the Schedule to this Bill.  This is another <Col N="343" /> aspect which has been grossly mishandled by the Government.  All that is needed by way of an amendment to the Constitution is in Part I and Part II of the Schedule to this Bill.  The first part of the Schedule states: &ldquo;The State may ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts signed at Amsterdam on the 2nd day of October, 1997.&rdquo; That is all that is required for us legally and constitutionally to ratify this treaty.  The treaty and the various protocols appended to it are perfectly lucid on the scope and applications of the options or discretions provided for.</P>
    <P>For my part I regret very much that Deputies Quinn and De Rossa chose to make an issue of the relevant part of the original text of this Bill. The fears they expressed were unfounded.  Their expression of those fears were ill-judged and unwise and gained a currency they did not deserve.  We have seen in his speech the text of the amendments the Minister intends to bring forward.  It seems they deal adequately with the issue.  I understand the Minister's amendment is a text that has been worked out by agreement between the Government and Opposition parties. While that is a constructive development, it would have been infinitely preferable to come to that conclusion by way of a debate in this House. I predict that opponents to the ratification of this treaty will claim that this part of the text of the constitutional amendment will be put together behind closed doors.  That is one of their favourite phrases and they will allege something is being hidden from the people.  I can hear them saying that already.  It would not have been possible to make that claim if the text had been worked out in a debate on the floor of the House.  The claim would be spurious, but the procedure adopted in this case may help to give it a certain spurious validity.</P>
    <P>This is a democratically elected assembly and our job is parliamentary scrutiny.  Our job is to debate in public all of the important issues that come before us.  We should not have been afraid or reluctant to debate that issue here.  I understand the proposed constitutional amendment will take the form of one question.  At one time there were suggestions that there should be two questions.  Those suggestions were entirely misguided. Since the second part of the proposed amendment is functionally redundant, it would have been bizarre to put this in the form of a second question.  What would our constitutional position have been in the event of two questions if there were a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote to the first one and a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote to the second one.  It would be utterly ludicrous to run the risk of that happening, not because there is any reluctance to have the issue properly discussed, but because one follows necessarily and inevitably from the other.  Parliamentary scrutiny by the Opposition is a necessity in our system, but it should be based on reality.</P>
    <P>Given the extent of the Government's mishandling <Col N="344" /> of the presentation in the White Paper and its mishandling of the formulation of the referendum question, the result of that debate in the form of the amendment which the Minister intends to bring before us is probably the best that can be obtained in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>The circumstances are that those who favour the ratification of this treaty have been given a handicap at the start of this contest and we must be conscious of that in the course of the debate which will ensue between now and the time the people vote on the proposal to amend the Constitution. I regret I have seen no evidence of any appreciation of that reality on the part of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his colleagues in Government. I know the Government has other concerns and that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are properly concerned, engaged in and preoccupied with the peace process but there are 13 other members of Cabinet.  I do not see any of them making an effort to adopt their collective responsibility to deal with this issue nor do I see any evidence that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is putting any effort into persuading the people that ratification of this treaty is a worthwhile enterprise.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I note that the unfounded allegation that this treaty in some way sets up a federal European police force is now being revived. I note with terror that a Danish MEP no less is being brought over from a NATO member state &mdash; which, as far as I know, has close and effective police co-operation with its neighbours in Sweden and Germany &mdash; to tell the people how this treaty will affect our neutrality and how its new powers for Europol could allegedly permit British policemen to operate cross-Border in the Republic in due course.  I look forward to having an opportunity later tonight to tell that gentleman in the hearing of the public how utterly specious his arguments are and to show how idiotic it is for the Green Party and others to claim to support strong action to protect our people against the evils of international drug trafficking, while attempting to deny us the very modest means made available by this treaty and the Europol convention to give some reality to the protection of our citizens against internationally organised crime, drug trafficking in particular.</P>
    <P>If the opportunity presents itself, I will also point out how specious and dishonest it is on the part of members of the Green Party to lecture to us about policies to favour environmental protection and to say at the same time that we should refuse to ratify a European treaty which will make a major contribution to strengthening action at EU level to enhance the protection of our environment.  It is arrant nonsense for people, one of whose mottoes is &ldquo;Think global, act local&rdquo;, to suggest that we should refuse to give a proper European dimension to environment policy which is largely lacking so far, and without which action at national level can only be at best marginally effective.  The Greens have a great deal to <Col N="345" /> answer for in the course of this debate.  We will drag them out and make them answer.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to stray from the subject matter of this Bill and being anxious to say nothing which would complicate the Northern peace process, I will make a final remark.  It is surely a fateful coincidence that we should debate the Amsterdam Treaty at a time when real and sincere efforts are being made to define the shape of an arrangement which will finally secure peace and justice in Northern Ireland.  Whatever the arrangement, it will involve some measure of sharing of sovereignty, however limited or restricted in scope, between the UK and Ireland in relation to Northern Ireland.  If we are sensible, people in the UK, Ireland and Northern Ireland will regard that sharing as a constructive exchange.  Each of us will give up and gain a little sovereignty.  The objective will be to secure something worthwhile for the people of these two islands and Northern Ireland, in particular.  Relinquishing and gaining elements of sovereignty on a mutual basis is what this European treaty, like previous treaties, is fundamentally about.  I hope this year will see us succeed in both enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998, or what has become known as the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is vitally important that every citizen is allowed to express his view on this treaty through the ballot box.  That will be democracy in action.  The structure will eventually crumble if we move away from the ballot box to vote on treaties which are so important to everyone in the European Union and to those who we hope will be our friends and colleagues in an expanded Community.</P>
      <P>On balance this treaty is good for Ireland, although I will talk about some shortcomings later.  The EU has increased in size since 1957 and 1972 when we joined and I hope it will increase further in future.  In comparing the EU to a creamery management committee, a mart or a board of directors, it is reasonable to assume that one cannot do with 20, 21 or 25 members what one may do with six or nine.  If Ireland and other small countries do not have Commissioners at the table, I will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in a referendum regardless of the treaty.  Irrespective of how large the Union becomes, a small sovereign country such as Ireland is entitled to be in the first division and to sit at the table with the best.  The only way we may express our views and aspirations is in the company of other Commissioners.  Irrespective of how large the Community becomes, Ireland should have a Commissioner at the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union is evolving at a considerable pace.  We will be delighted when the next four, five or six countries join because it will be <Col N="346" /> good for Europe.  It will not be good for the sector in Ireland which I know best and there will be many problems in agriculture because of enlargement. However, that is no reason not to enlarge the Union.  History has taught us that a unified Europe is better than a divided one.</P>
    <P>With this new treaty, the Maastricht Treaty and previous treaties, the Union has changed beyond recognition.  For years everything was based on the common agricultural policy.  We now face economic and monetary union, international terrorism and drug trafficking.  We must put structures in place to enable us to deal with those issues which is what the people of Europe want.</P>
    <P>A problem I have with the European Union is that it did not take unemployment seriously. There were many pious platitudes and I listened to endless debates, discussions and lectures in Europe on what would be done and what could be done.  Most initiatives came to nothing.  It seems to be different now, but I will believe it when I see it.  Given that there is an unemployment rate in Europe of 10 to 11 per cent, and that includes some of the most industrialised nations, it can be seen we have not been successful in dealing with unemployment.  The unemployment figures here have been significantly reduced and our economy is doing very well.  One reason I will be delighted to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum is that part of our economic recovery is due to EU initiatives and incentives we received through the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>I also have a problem with the internal market. I have believed since the Treaty of Rome that a product manufactured and sold in one member state was entitled to be sold in another member state.  I assumed that was what was meant by internal free trade and that it was what everyone else believed it to be.  I have recently witnessed a spectacular renationalisation in some countries with respect to food products such as beef and lamb, especially Irish beef and lamb.  While it is related to the BSE issue, what happened in the supermarkets in England and in European cities is as contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome as it could possibly be.  Many people in rural Ireland now ask how safe the internal market is and what enforcement procedures the European Union has for a member state which attempts to ensure we do not have due access to its market.  I do not believe there are any, and if there are, they are not being implemented.  Our agriculture sector must export nine out of every ten animals.  It would be a pity if, as a result of an internal market problem, all the advantages of EU membership were forgotten.  It is hard to excite people about voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum, but I will make the case to rural communities that their best interests lie in supporting the treaty. However, it is no harm that the message be sent out loud and clear to the Eurocrats that they have a responsibility to ensure member states do not &ldquo;act the maggot&rdquo; as they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the lack of public awareness in member states about the European Union, its <Col N="347" /> philosophy, what it stands for, where it is heading and what it means for the working men and women in the various member states.  Despite what people say, various surveys suggest that we do not seem to be able to put across the message. There is little interest in this debate, for example. There would be more interest if there were a debate on the preservation of bogs or the rerouting of traffic in Dublin.  I do not know who is to blame, but the European Union and national Governments must do much more to put across their message.  One thing which can scuttle a union such as the EU is lack of interest.  One thing leads to another, and before long, people will not care what happens.</P>
    <P>Some people in Opposition oppose this treaty and they are similar to those who wanted a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in 1972 and for the Maastricht Treaty.  I assume if we had another treaty in three weeks' time after this one, they would still vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Some people suggest that greater integration in the European Union, both monetary and political, means people will become less nationalistic.  I do not know if that is correct.  Since we joined the European Union, more people participate in Irish dancing and in playing hurling and football and participation is increasing as the years go by.  It is not that we are in competition with anyone.  It is just that it enhances our way of life and culture. It is the same in France and other member states. I do not subscribe to the view of those who oppose the treaty.  We can hold on to everything which is good for us and join the club at the same time.  Imagine what it would be like if we were outside the Union?  The financial consequences would certainly be disastrous.</P>
    <P>While the Santer proposals are not part of the debate, they are certainly part of the evolution of the European Union.  Deputy Enright spoke of the flight from the land and the problems of many rural areas.  The Santer proposals will not only create a huge problem for Ireland but also for small farming communities throughout the 15 member states.  It will make no difference if it is a German, French, Scottish, Galway or Tipperary farmer; they will all face the same problems.  A mission statement must be made on the Santer proposals.  It is no problem for us to go the road of New Zealand and Australia.  It would be the easiest route.  It would mean that market forces would prevail and there would be no intervention. It would result in something similar to what I saw in New Zealand: an ordinary farmer shearing 8,000 sheep.  That number of sheep would have sustained ten farmers ten to 15 years ago.  That is a huge replacement.  People from all rural communities across Europe must come together to say they joined the European Union to ensure the maximum number of people were kept in rural areas.  The greatest mistake that can be made is if the European Union is not in a position to deliver initiatives through national Governments to keep local communities vibrant and to create conditions to enhance living standards <Col N="348" /> in those areas.  There will be much discussion of the Santer proposals in this House. Many people voting in the referendum will reflect on their future in the area where they live if the Santer proposals are implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing time with me and compliment him on an excellent contribution.  I support the referendum on the 18th amendment of the Constitution and I encourage as many people as possible to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I have no difficulty with those who advocate a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote.  That is their right provided their statements are correct and they are not pulling skeletons from the cupboard to frighten people away from voting.</P>
      <P>I came into the House to take issue with Deputy Ó Caoláin's statement when he called for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote.  He referred to Fine Gael's role as leader of a future Government and I take exception to his comments on our stance on upholding Irish neutrality.  Fine Gael will uphold the decisions of this House.  It was the founder of the Constitution and has upheld the structures of the State.  The country was safe in Fine Gael's hands in the past and it will be so in the future.  The Deputy should take that on board as a new Deputy and he should think twice before again making such rash statements.  He is ill-informed.</P>
      <P>As fully fledged members of the EU we must be seen to play our part.  We must acknowledge the great benefits we have received since 1973. The transfer of funds from Europe has transformed the country and brought about major improvements.  The upsurge in our economy has resulted mainly from the these transfers &mdash; Europe has been extremely generous.  If we decide to opt out of the treaty we will be regarded as not playing our part and we could not expect the continued support of other member states.</P>
      <P>Ireland's European Commissioners have represented this country very well.  Last Thursday in Letterkenny I listened to Commissioner Flynn deliver an excellent address to the Border Regional Authority on the development of the EU and the future as he sees it.  I questioned him on the need to ensure that we retain Objective One status for the Border region and the west of Ireland which have not made the same strides as the rest of the country.  There is a strong case to be made for a further transfer of Structural Funds.  We will not be in a position to make that case if we do not have a Commissioner with the ability to do so.  I regret that we have a Fianna Fáil Commissioner, I would rather a Fine Gael Commissioner, nevertheless, he is doing a good job and representing the country as a whole. However, he must be slightly parochial on this occasion and represent the region from which he comes and I know he will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We incorporated European directives into domestic legislation on issues affecting women's rights.  This has transformed the role of women. They can now take their rightful place in the workplace and it is accepted that they have time <Col N="349" /> off to play a role in the home.  Men may not have liked this when it was thrust upon us but we now see it is a forward thinking initiative under which women can play a role similar to that of their counterparts in the UK and Europe.</P>
    <P>Protection of young people is the kernel of the problem of drugs importation.  Massive amounts of drugs are coming into the country.  No doubt the Green Party, the Independents and Deputy Ó Caoláin would resent Europol playing any role alongside the Garda in preventing drugs coming into the country.  They could not be more wrong. We must have full co-operation and contact across Europe wherever these drugs are sourced. Countless millions of pounds worth of drugs have been confiscated as a result of good information being supplied by Europol to our law enforcement agencies set up to intercept the traffic in drugs and prevent the abuse of young people. More sinister is that Ireland was used as a base for exporting drugs into Europe.  This is not acceptable and any individual or party which shirks its duty to encourage full co-operation and commitment in the EU to stamp out this trade would be doing a grave injustice to our people, especially the young.</P>
    <P>I will highlight animal diseases, BSE and European markets.  On Tuesday last the Minister visited a milk powder factory in my constituency which exports its produce worldwide and to Europe in particular.  We have free access to these markets and our market must be open to imports from Europe.  We can produce agricultural goods equal to and better than the best.  We have nothing to fear if we can place these goods on the market at a competitive price.  We have and will continue to reap the benefits but we must be seen to be prepared to play our part in Europe.</P>
    <P>We must also encourage the enlargement of the EU.  A recent television programme examined farming in Poland which is seeking EU membership.  The programme illustrated that Polish agriculture is at the stage we were at 40 years ago.  I was amazed at how backward Poland's agriculture sector is.  However, I also noticed that the quality of Polish soil is far superior to that in Ireland.  We cannot be negative and hold European funds for ourselves, closing the door on other member states.  That is not the Ireland that I represent, it would be a selfish approach.  Polish farmers are entitled to join the EU and receive transfers of funds. We are so far ahead of Poland that if it catches up and displaces us in the marketplace it will be our fault, not the fault of the EU or the Polish people.  They will make great strides when they get opportunities similar to those which were presented to us.  The Ireland I know aspires to seeing all EU member states and those further afield having the opportunities which we have enjoyed.  I call on those in my constituency to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in May on the 18th amendment of the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Boylan for the welcome extended to me in Virginia, County Cavan.  I commend the plant there on receiving an award for meeting EU standards.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate for their constructive approach.  It is clear there is wide support in the House for the Treaty of Amsterdam, the ratification of which is the ultimate purpose of the Bill.  Support for the treaty is rightly understood as support for the continued, full and committed participation of Ireland in the European Union as further developed by that treaty.  This is fundamental and I welcome the emphasis placed on it by so many speakers.</P>
      <P>I will expand on the remarks made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs by focusing first on the wider context in which the treaty has been considered necessary.  There is a shared concern throughout the European Union that the challenges evident in this century and expected in the next should be met by a Union which is better equipped politically, economically and institutionally. As many speakers reminded us, history and our own experience show us that it is only through the European Union that we can ensure peace and prosperity among the member states.  I agree with Deputy Quinn that enlargement has been in the past, and will be again, the Union's way of seeking to guarantee peace, democracy and the rule of law for an increasing number of the people of Europe.</P>
      <P>The reaffirmation of the principles on which the Union is founded &mdash; liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law &mdash; is accompanied in the treaty by an explicit provision that only countries which respect these principles may apply to become members of the Union. This is fundamental.  It is copperfastened by a provision which allows for the suspension of certain rights of membership, ultimately including voting rights, if a member state is found guilty of a serious and continuing breach of those principles.</P>
      <P>The debate has shown that it is important to see the Treaty of Amsterdam as part of a process of maturing for the Union and for Ireland within the Union.  During the 25 years since we joined the European Union membership has grown from nine to 15 and there is a very real prospect that it will exceed 20 during the next decade.  It would be an understatement to merely say this development will present us with challenges and opportunities as it will also present us with choices. These choices will involve a balance between our own interests and those of our existing and prospective partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is a good deal for Ireland, for Europe and for European citizens.  It addresses the core issues which affect daily life throughout Europe: employment, the environment, social policy, public health, consumer rights and combating discrimination.  It establishes <Col N="351" /> fundamental rights on a treaty basis for the Union and creates a framework in which freedom of movement can be progressively realised to the maximum extent possible.  It couples this with flanking measures in areas such as external border controls and fighting international crime.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed support for those aspects of the treaty which deal with the related areas of freedom of movement and fighting international crime.  The aim of the treaty in this area is to enhance the capacity of member states to ensure the safety of its citizens by developing common action among states in the fields of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and by combating racism and xenophobia. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, the Treaty of Amsterdam subjects this kind of co-operation, which has been developed in the Union since Maastricht, to democratic and judicial controls for the first time.</P>
    <P>While there are different views on whether the treaty does enough in terms of reform of the Union's institutions, it is accepted that the European Parliament is the institution which has fared best.  This means there is a gain in democratic accountability.  A number of Members met yesterday with the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Gil Robles, who is visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>The treaty is a good deal for Europe because it strengthens and makes more coherent the foreign policy capacity of the Union and better prepares it for the next historic enlargement phase. Importantly for Ireland, there is no change in the right of each member state to nominate a full member of the Commission.  In advance of membership exceeding 20, the Union's institutions will be further examined to ensure that its functioning is not impaired by enlargement.  In response to a question raised this morning, the outcome of the future review of the Union's institutions is not prejudged.  It is clearly in Ireland's interest, and in accordance with our long established European policy, to be at the heart of the process of European integration.  The Government believes the public would wish the State to have the capacity and freedom to continue to participate fully in the Union's development.  The modified wording of the constitutional amendment which the Government proposes to put to the people will, if accepted, ensure that Ireland can remain at the heart of the European project.  The Minister explained the legal reasons behind this approach.</P>
    <P>The view that the European Union should play a full and positive role on the international stage was reflected in many of the contributions.  The widespread support expressed for the revised Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam is welcome and fully justified.  Ireland's long tradition of a principled, constructive and engaged foreign policy finds strong expression through our participation in CFSP and enables us to join our EU partners in pursuit of the goals of international peace and justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> In response to some of the issues raised by Deputies, Ireland's neutrality is not affected by this treaty.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs set out clearly the scope of, and the safeguards in, the Treaty of Amsterdam.  I respectfully invite those Deputies and members of the public who continue to have reservations on this point to accept that Ireland's policy of military neutrality is not under threat.  Furthermore, the Government's commitment, which repeats commitments given by successive Governments, to put the issue to the people for decision if it ever arises in the future ensures the issue of military neutrality remains one for the people to decide.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that, despite some suggestions to the contrary, the EU does not aspire to become a nuclear superpower, waging war on neighbouring countries or regions and there is nothing in the Treaty of Amsterdam which supports such a contention.  The inclusion of the Petersberg tasks in the new treaty should not be seen as a threat to the United Nations.  Successive Secretaries-General have called for greater regional support of the efforts of the United Nations in the peacekeeping and crisis management areas. The treaty explicitly situates the CFSP in the context of the principles of the UN Charter.</P>
    <P>The experience of the international community in recent years in the former Yugoslavia, Albania and the Great Lakes region in Africa has demonstrated that if the international community is to play a role in conflict management and post-conflict rehabilitation a greater degree of commitment from the EU is required.  The progressive framing of a common defence policy is situated in the context of the Petersberg tasks which were conceived in the context of support for the UN and OSCE.  This is very much in line with Ireland's position on international peacekeeping, an area where the members of our Defence Forces and Garda have served with distinction for many years with the popular and proud support of the public.  Ireland wants the EU to make an improved contribution to international peace and security, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter, and we are willing to contribute to these tasks on a case-by-case and voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not a member of the Western European Union and has no intention of joining it. Like our three fellow neutral members of the EU, Austria, Finland and Sweden, we are observers at the Western European Union.  The importance of our continuing observer status in the Western European Union is underlined by the inclusion in the Amsterdam Treaty of the Petersberg tasks which will be carried out by the Western European Union at the instigation of the EU.  Integration of the Western European Union into the EU is not an agreed objective of the EU and is not provided for anywhere in the treaty or its protocols.</P>
    <P>The issue of nuclear weapons has nothing to do with the Western European Union's declared willingness to support the UN, the OSCE or the EU by providing an operational capacity for the <Col N="353" /> Petersberg tasks.  Ireland's long standing policy against nuclear weapons is well known and understood by our EU partners.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to a number of aspects of the EU agenda in the period ahead.  We are weeks away from decisions on the participants in the first phase of EMU.  Over the medium-term, the review of the financial perspectives, the future of the CAP and of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and EU enlargement will be the predominant issues.  Enlargement, which will be a major issue for the European Union in the future, figures particularly high on the EU agenda this month.  An essential prerequisite of further enlargement, achieved by the Treaty of Amsterdam, is the affirmation by member states of the European Union, in practical as well as political terms, of their total commitment to defending the rights and pursuing the interests of their peoples. The Union has no higher purpose.</P>
    <P>The commencement of the next phase of the enlargement process is a decisive step forward in the historic project of creating a new Europe, united on the basis of shared democratic principles, respect for minorities and human rights, and with economic opportunity and social justice for all.  Extending the model of European integration which is represented by the European Union throughout the continent holds out the promise of future stability and prosperity.  The European Council held in Luxembourg in December took the necessary decisions to launch the next phase of the enlargement process.  It decided on an accession process involving all ten central and eastern European applicants and Cyprus.  It set in motion an inclusive process designed to lead in time to accession by all the new democracies that have applied to join the Union.</P>
    <P>It was agreed at Luxembourg to establish the European Conference as a new forum to bring together the member states of the European Union and the states aspiring to accede to it. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend the inaugural meeting of the European Conference in London next week. The formal accession process will be launched on 30 March and will be followed the next day by the inauguration of bilateral Intergovernmental Conferences with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus.  At the same time, the process of preparing Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria for future negotiations will be speeded up.</P>
    <P>From the outset, Ireland has made clear its commitment to enlargement as an historic opportunity for peace and stability in Europe and we consider that the momentum towards enlargement is now irreversible.  We are committed to supporting the applicant states in their efforts as they prepare for accession and look forward to welcoming them as our partners in the European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> It goes without saying that enlargement on the scale envisaged will be a very considerable economic undertaking by the Union and will have significant financial implications.  The Union will, therefore, have to provide the resources necessary to make it a success.  No less importantly, the Union must also ensure resources to consolidate its achievements to date in existing member states.  For Ireland, there are two areas where this consideration is of particular importance, namely, sustaining the economic development of less advanced regions and the Union meeting in full its commitment to maintaining a viable rural community.</P>
    <P>Against that background the Union is currently engaged in a review of its future financing and a number of core policy areas.  This process, collectively known as Agenda 2000, is of major significance to Ireland as it involves the future shape of the Union's structural and agricultural policies.  I am confident Ireland will continue to benefit significantly from the Union's structural and cohesion policies.</P>
    <P>We have experienced an undisputed improvement in economic performance in recent years and our membership of the European Union has been an important factor in this.  However, it must equally be stressed that the long-term sustainability of this achievement must be ensured and that we have much ground to make up before we replicate the state of development of European economies with a longer history of economic progress.  This is especially true in the context of infrastructural investment, where we have substantial outstanding development needs.</P>
    <P>Regarding agriculture, the forthcoming negotiations will focus on further reform of the common agricultural policy.  We accept that European agriculture must become more competitive in world markets and that it must be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  This is in our long-term interest as a major exporter of agricultural products.  At the same time, the reform process must be carried out in a manner which preserves the essentials of the common agricultural policy and which ensures that the interests of farmers and rural communities are fully protected.</P>
    <P>It is worth reiterating that Ireland has been and wishes to remain at the forefront of European development and integration.  The tasks ahead at European level are very significant for the development of peace and security in Europe. Ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam is a next and necessary step in the completion of those tasks, a view shared by the overwhelming majority of Deputies.  I am greatly encouraged by the views expressed in the debate and hope the Government's view of the Treaty of Amsterdam as constituting a good deal for Ireland, for Europe, and its citizens will be endorsed by the people in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

The Bill also proposes to amend the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, to provide a similar power in that legislation to authorise the compulsory acquisition of a substratum of land for the construction and maintenance of a tunnel in connection with light rail development should this be necessary. In addition, the Bill deals with two other matters, namely, the judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and road related environmental impact statements and confirmation of the status as motorways of a number of proposed public roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Roads Act, 1993, was enacted by the Oireachtas to provide a comprehensive and modern legislative framework for road development. Preparation of the legislation, which comprised 85 sections and three Schedules, involved considerable work in research and drafting.  Prior to enactment there was extensive scrutiny of the Bill by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For these reasons, the Roads Act, 1993, will stand the test <Col N="356" /> of time as the main legislative basis for the development of Ireland's road network. However, in this important and complex area of Government activity it was probably inevitable that, in the course of experience with the operation of the legislation, matters would come to attention which either could with benefit be added to the legislation or in relation to which clarification of the law would be desirable.  Three such matters have arisen in relation to the Roads Act, 1993, and are the subject of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the proposed Dublin Port tunnel project is one element of the Dublin Transportation Initiative for the city.  In the course of the planning of the project by Dublin Corporation, legal doubt has arisen over the powers of the corporation as a road authority to compulsorily acquire land required for the tunnel.</P>
    <P>The corporation proposes that the land to be acquired for the project should consist of the underground section, or substratum necessary for the tunnel and should not involve the compulsory acquisition of all the land above or below it or of any buildings located on the land.  The essence of the legal issue which arose was whether the land acquisition powers contained in the Roads Act, 1993 would allow the corporation to acquire only the necessary substratum of land, as it proposes. Differing views were expressed on this issue.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter, the Government came to the conclusion that it was desirable to ensure there was no legal uncertainty over the powers of local authorities generally, within the framework of the motorway scheme and environmental impact assessment procedures of the Roads Act, 1993, to compulsorily acquire substrata of land necessary for road tunnels.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 3 amends section 47 of the Roads Act, 1993, in a number of places to provide that a motorway scheme made by a road authority may specify any substratum of land which it is proposed to compulsorily acquire for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 4 amends section 52 of the 1993 Act to provide that, when the Minister approves a motorway scheme, the road authority will there-upon be authorised, under section 52(1), to compulsorily acquire any substratum of land specified in the scheme and that the general law on compulsory purchase will also apply to the acquisition of a substratum of land.  Similarly, the new subsection (7) to be inserted in section 52 confirms that any reference to land in the compulsory purchase code includes a reference to a substratum of land.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention, nor will it be the effect of this new legislation, to take away from the statutory procedures which must be followed before any project could proceed which involved the provision of a road tunnel along the lines set out in the Bill.  This Bill does not authorise the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the port tunnel is the subject of continuing public debate.  Whether the project goes ahead, and in what form, will be decided <Col N="357" /> through the statutory motorway scheme and environmental impact assessment procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993.  A full motorway scheme and a comprehensive environmental impact statement will have to be prepared by the corporation and submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; the public will have to be given an adequate opportunity to make submissions on the project and on its environmental impact; a public inquiry will have to be held at which all views can be heard; and a report on the inquiry will have to be prepared and submitted for decision.</P>
    <P>The final decision on the port tunnel will therefore be made another day and as part of a different process.  For that reason, the debate in this House should not be a forum for discussion of the merits and demerits of the port tunnel project.  In any event, it will not be possible for me to enter into any such discussion in the course of the debate or elsewhere in view of the quasi-judicial functions which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is likely to be called upon to exercise in the project at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the proposed amendment to the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, which is contained in section 6.  The 1996 Act is similar to, and based to a large extent on, the Roads Act, 1993.  Amendment of the 1996 Act is therefore also required in so far as it relates to compulsory acquisition of a substratum of land and the opportunity is being taken to provide for this in the current Bill.</P>
    <P>During the passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, the then Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications stressed that the Act was enabling legislation which did not seek to dictate the detail of how light rail is to be implemented and in no way excluded the possibility of any section of the light rail system being provided underground.  Concern was expressed by many Deputies and Senators at the time that the underground option was being excluded because the legislation as drafted did not refer to it explicitly.  To allay those concerns, the Minister of State agreed to amend the Bill to make it explicit that the underground option was not being ruled out.  It now appears, however, in light of the position as it has emerged with regard to the roads legislation, that these amendments may not have been sufficient to achieve their intended purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 6, therefore, provides that under section 10(2) of the 1996 Act, a light railway order may specify any substratum of land the acquisition of which is necessary to give effect to the order.  Section 6 goes on to provide for the compulsory acquisition of substrata of land under section 13(1) and (2) of the 1996 Act.  The new subsection (3) in section 13 of the 1996 Act confirms that any reference to land in the compulsory purchase code, which is to be used for light rail land acquisition, includes a reference to a substratum of land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> These provisions are all the more important now that the underground option for light rail in the city centre is being evaluated.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister for Public Enterprise has appointed consultants to carry out a study based on a comparative evaluation of two broad options.  These comprise the on-street Tallaght-City Centre-Dundrum line proposed by CIE in its formal application for a light railway order, and the same line with an underground section in the city centre.  This will permit a thorough evaluation of the on-street and underground options for the city centre in the context of ClE's concrete proposals for a Tallaght-City Centre-Dundrum route.  The underground study was commissioned because the Government was concerned about the absence of a detailed and satisfactory response to concerns expressed by organisations and individuals about the light rail project and the ability of an on-street system to meet passenger demand in the long term.  The Government felt it could not take a decision to proceed with a project of this importance in the absence of a fully independent analysis of those concerns.</P>
    <P>It was always intended that the 1996 Act would confer the necessary rights to proceed with an underground option should that option be decided upon and this Bill is intended to restore that position.  As with the port tunnel, a process entirely separate from this Bill will determine which option is to be chosen.</P>
    <P>The second issue relating to the Roads Act, 1993, concerns judicial review.  The 1993 Act contains no specific provisions relating to judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes or roads-related environmental impact statements.  This is in marked contrast to other legislative codes.  For example, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992; the Waste Management Act, 1996; and indeed the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, all contain specific provisions governing judicial review of decisions under those codes.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that there should be clear provisions applying to judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and roads-related environmental impact statements and that these should be framed in a way which is broadly similar to provisions in other comparable legislation. Accordingly, section 5 introduces three new provisions.  First, an action challenging the validity of a decision of the Minister on a motorway scheme or on a roads-related environmental impact statement will have to be by way of an application for judicial review.  Proceedings will have to be instituted within two months by motion on notice to interested persons.  Second, the High Court will not grant leave to apply for review unless it is satisfied there are substantial grounds for contending that the decision challenged is invalid or ought to be quashed.  Third, the High Court's decision will be final unless it certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance, in which case appeal may be made to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> It is important to emphasise that these new provisions will not restrict the right to institute proceedings challenging these decisions.  They are intended merely to ensure that any such proceedings can be brought to finality as expeditiously as possible, bearing in mind the importance of having final and conclusive decisions on major road development proposals within a reasonable timescale.</P>
    <P>The final provision relating to the Roads Act, 1993, is intended to put beyond doubt the status as motorways of a limited number of proposed public roads.</P>
    <P>The Roads Act, 1993, substituted new motorway scheme procedures for those in the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, the repeal of which was provided for by the 1993 Act.  The procedures under the 1974 Act had two elements.  First, a motorway scheme was prepared by a local authority, then a public inquiry was held and finally a ministerial decision was made on the scheme.  Second, where a motorway scheme was approved by the Minister another separate ministerial order was required declaring the road the subject of the approved scheme to be a motorway.</P>
    <P>By contrast, the 1993 Act provides for a single motorway scheme procedure which involves only one formal decision by the Minister.  That Act also contained transitional provisions aimed at catering for situations where motorway schemes had been made by local authorities under the 1974 Act but the procedures under that Act had not been completed at the point when the Act was repealed.</P>
    <P>Subsequent experience with these transitional provisions suggests that they may not be sufficient to make good the absence from the 1993 Act of the previous power of formally declaring to be a motorway a road which had been the subject of an approved motorway scheme under the 1974 Act.  Three approved motorway schemes are involved: the Southern Cross Route, Dunleer/Dundalk and the Kildare Town Bypass.</P>
    <P>Section 7, therefore, provides for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government making orders in these specified circumstances, to declare these roads to be motorways.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to elaborate on the provisions of the Bill in the course of its consideration by the House.  I emphasise that we are fortunate to have in the Roads Act, 1993, a modern legislative framework for road development.  The Bill now before the House further enhances the capacity of that Act to serve as an instrument to realise the road network that we all want.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Any measure that facilitates the alleviation of traffic problems is welcome.  We will not object to the provision of power to local authorities to acquire a substratum of land for the construction of a road tunnel.  This will have a bearing on the construction of a Dublin Port tunnel.  Given the increased use of the port for freight &mdash; there has been a huge increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles using Dublin city roads &mdash; there must be a quality link from Dublin Port, which has been described as one of our national assets, to a motorway system on the outskirts of the city.  The proposed motorway scheme for the Dublin Port tunnel must address the problem of heavy goods traffic associated with Dublin Port with a view to relieving traffic congestion.</P>
      <P>The benefits of the proposed scheme will extend beyond the immediate vicinity of the scheme.  They include the redistribution of traffic, increased accessibility and attractiveness of areas for development and improvement to pedestrian and residential amenities.  Not only are there traffic problems resulting from the large number of cars on our roads, with commuters in and out of the city at peak hours creating huge traffic volumes, but because of our increased economic activity and the subsequent increased use of Dublin Port, a greater number of heavy goods vehicles choke the city, causing increased traffic congestion.  They also have a deteriorating effect on the condition of our roads.</P>
      <P>Heavy goods vehicles are becoming bigger and heavier as technology advances and consumer demand dictates.  The axle loads of those vehicles reach levels that were unknown 20 years ago. That is one of the main reasons for the deteriorating quality of roadways in our cities.  Many city roads were built for a different era, not for the constant trundle of heavy goods vehicles which use them today.  I am aware from speaking to the city engineer in Cork that there is a great problem in that city because the substratum is soft and marshy and the road pavement collapses under the weight of large articulated lorries.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems with poor road surfaces in our cities could be avoided if heavy goods vehicles were kept off our city roads and moved on to roads designed to accommodate them.  Not only do those vehicles damage the road surface but they contribute to a reduction in air quality and, therefore, they should not be allowed in city centres where there is a large concentration of people.  Large vehicles are unattractive and they obstruct one's line of vision.  They are very slow moving and cumbersome, thus contributing greatly to traffic congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It makes sense to develop a scheme to move those vehicles from the city centre to a road network linked to the rest of the country.  The operators of heavy vehicles have no interest in sitting for hours in Dublin traffic when with increased efficiency they could be half way to their destination, whether it be Cork, Limerick, Galway or Waterford.  The scheme will bring about significant <Col N="361" /> benefits in terms of improvements in trade with other countries and facilitating increased trade through Dublin port without restrictions created by traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>The construction of a tunnel will undoubtedly be of concern for the residents and commercial interests in the area.  The Minister should ensure lines of communication are kept open with residents of the area.  None of us wants to stand in the way of development, but the needs and concerns of residential areas should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the acquisition of a substratum of land, should that be necessary &mdash; I hope it will not be necessary &mdash; for the Luas system.  Fine Gael favours the construction of an overground system and hopes it will not be delayed further.  The proposed Dublin light rail system is in grave danger of being lost to the communities of Dublin because of what appears to be deliberate delaying tactics of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The new study of the underground option ordered by the Minister has long-fingered the project.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to re-examine a system that has been already fully examined.  That decision is unacceptable from the point of view of cost and for many other reasons.  The option of an underground system in Dublin has been examined and eliminated. The cost of the underground system was estimated at approximately £495 million for almost 18 kilometres of track.  That compares to £224 million for 22 kilometres of on-street light rail transport.  The construction timetable for the underground system is at least two years longer than for the LRT system.  That is best estimate as ground works can be notoriously slow and unpredictable.  Delays could seriously jeopardise the possibility of securing EU funding for the project.</P>
    <P>Public opinion strongly favours an overground light rail system.  Extensive research by MRBI shows that 64 per cent of the public favours the light rail option while only 20 per cent favours the underground option.  That finding should not be ignored.  People prefer to use overground systems, whether because of a fear of being trapped or being more vulnerable underground.  Women in particular do not tend to use the underground system at night for safety reasons.  Consideration must be given to those matters as well as to an analysis undertaken by the light rail office which indicates that the on-street option would result in a greater reduction in the number of people using car transport and existing public transport modes. The on-street option offers greater park and ride opportunities as well as providing more stations than the underground option.</P>
    <P>The original proposal for a light rail network came from a need to provide, on a relatively low cost basis, a quality public transport service which would be adequate to cater for anticipated demand on selected corridors and would have the capacity to attract car commuters on to public transport by providing fast, reliable and frequent <Col N="362" /> services on key routes to the city centre.  Light rail transport offers the best opportunity to meet those policy aims and to help promote wider objectives such as urban regeneration and protection of the urban environment.</P>
    <P>Light rail transport is the most cost effective where urban traffic levels are in the intermediate capacity range, between the upper levels of high density bus service and the lower levels of a full metro or heavy suburban railway line.  Transport demand patterns in Dublin are considered to be ideally suited to the selective application of light rail technology.  The key feature of the light rail system is its flexibility.  It can meet a wide range of passenger demands both off peak and at peak times.  It appeals to various sectors, particularly car users who do not consider Dublin Bus as an attractive alternative.</P>
    <P>I watched with interest a recent &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTE where 20 commuters were interviewed.  All those people, who leave their homes at about 7 a.m. to get into the city, said they would not use Dublin Bus because of delays, unreliability and inflexibility.  Dublin Bus has a negative public image.  There has been a decline in bus usage from a maximum of 220 million passengers in 1973.  This is because the service is perceived as unreliable, not very clean and inefficient. I have no doubt Dublin Bus has gone a long way to improve its customer service, but it is shackled by the gridlock on the streets.  It is in a Catch 22 situation.  It cannot appeal to the commuters to leave their cars at home and it cannot increase efficiency because it is unable to demonstrate how it will improve its services.</P>
    <P>Dublin's traffic problems will not be solved unless there is an effective, reliable and frequent transport service, such as light rail, which is especially attractive to car users probably because it is clean and quiet.  By contrast, buses are dirty from an air quality point of view.  The Government should not subsidise diesel for use in public transport.  I ask the Minister to look at ways to encourage Dublin Bus and taxis to use alternative fuels such as liquid petroleum gas, which is cleaner and quieter.  Buses have not improved their exterior image of being noisy and coughing clouds of black fumes into the atmosphere.  By contrast, a light rail system is noiseless and much kinder to the environment.</P>
    <P>The light rail will be able to ensure its own right of way on the street and avoid getting bogged down in traffic and commuters will be able to depend on the system to always get to their destinations on time.  The predictability of the system will generate confidence.  LRT has a proven ability worldwide to attract car users, reduce traffic and the pressure for car parking spaces in the city centre.  Given that it is a rail based system it also has the attraction of permanence and can make an important contribution to urban regeneration in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The construction of the light rail system will involve substantial disruption due to the laying of track, the installation of overhead wires and the <Col N="363" /> relocation of underground services, such as gas, electricity, water, sewerage and telecom lines. However, once the system is in operation the streets will benefit from reduced congestion and improvement to the environment, thus contributing to a better climate for economic activity. Market research has shown that there is widespread public support for a light rail system. Some 78 per cent of those interviewed said the introduction of light rail would be justified notwithstanding the disruption caused during construction.</P>
    <P>The Minster should take action and recognise that since 1990 travelling times in the Dublin area have doubled.  Some 60,000 of the 130,000 new cars last year were registered in Dublin.  Traffic has become the greatest problem for Dubliners and for those working in the city and using it for economic gain.  We need to see that something positive is being done to invest in the future of public transport.  However, the Minister for Public Enterprise has not given this impression.  I hope this Bill will facilitate the speedy introduction of the light rail system and Dublin Port when it gets the go ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, which empowers local authorities as road authorities to compulsorily acquire land and substrata of land for tunnelling purposes.  I also welcome its speedy introduction to the House and applaud Dublin City Council for accepting the recommendation of a port access tunnel and for grasping the nettle on what cannot have been an easy political decision.  Tunnelling may not be at the cutting edge of technology.  However, it is new to this country and there are understandable concerns. In view of this, Dublin City Council showed great determination.</P>
      <P>Section 5 limits the time in which judicial reviews can be sought after CPOs have been signed by the Minister on this or on any infrastructural project under the Act.  The second part of the section restricts the circumstances in which such reviews can be entertained.  While I welcome the inclusion of these provisions, which I long called for and which are overdue, I have reservations about the efficacy of the legislation in achieving what is hoped for.</P>
      <P>Resorting to the courts and engaging in deliberate delaying tactics is a feature of an increasingly litigious society.  It is increasingly associated with public projects often for selfish, self interested or vexatious reasons.  These are contrary to the common good and work against the interest of the silent majority which is increasingly perplexed by our inability to move projects on which there is common agreement and for which every right thinking person sees the need from decision stage to implementation or construction stage.  In consequence, the EU, which funds many of these projects, has commented on more than one occasion on our apparent willingness to lose funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="364" /> The interests of the individual, however he or she may object to proposals, are well protected under the Constitution and legislation.  We have a fair and independent system of arbitration and compensation.  Once a project has moved from planning and consultation stage we must call a halt to the consultation process once there has been a public inquiry and recommendations to the Minister who, having examined them, makes an order.  The common good must then be allowed to prevail.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have the duty to uphold the rights of the majority while protecting the rights of individuals and in a democracy a balance must be struck between the rights of the individual and the rights of the majority.  In addition, the individual's entitlement to appeal a decision should not be limited.  However, time limits must be placed on that entitlement if there is to be any certainty. In increasing numbers of cases individuals get their day in court at the cost of the many where infrastructural projects have been delayed almost indefinitely.</P>
    <P>This Bill brings legislation into line with the Planning Acts, which are ineffective.  Increasingly, we are losing important investment opportunities and EU funding and are delaying infrastructural projects because of the failure of the system to place a time limit on judicial reviews and access to the courts.  If this legislation is not strong enough it must be revisited for the sake of the country, including its economic future.</P>
    <P>Section 6 extends the right to acquire a substratum of land which may be required in the context of a light rail order.  I welcome this prudent provision but it is my devout wish that such a right will not be required in the context of at least the first two planned lines of the light rail system. If it is required we will be back to the drawing board.  EU funding will be lost and the scheme will be postponed almost indefinitely.  I hope the Minister is aware there cannot be any face saving or compromise solutions to appease a few objectors by, for example, allowing for a partial underground solution.  Even the smallest portion of undergrounding, such as under the canal, would require major design work and set back the entire project with indefinite consequential delays.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's comment that no independent analysis of the light rail project was carried out.  There was such an analysis; I was part of it and I recall the public consultation that took place over many years.  The original Steer Davies Gleave analysis cost the State several million pounds.  It is wrong, after a decision was made, to jeopardise all the work put into the project, particularly when there is an obvious need to proceed with improvement of the public transportation system in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a worry about the ability of Luas to cope with passenger demand in the long term.  This would ring a little more true if any concern was shown for the ability to cope with passenger demand in the short term by providing a subvention to Dublin Bus to allow it to <Col N="365" /> increase its capacity and provide some form of a service.</P>
    <P>The Bill is primarily designed to facilitate the port tunnel, which is an essential part of the jigsaw of Dublin transportation initiatives.  Its purpose is to move goods in and out of the port to and from the M50 motorway.  It is also an important part of the national network in terms of moving goods to the rest of the country.  As the Minister said, the details of the port tunnel are a matter for another day.  It may be a matter for another year or even the next millennium.  It will not be constructed quickly.  At best, given the history of such projects, it is five years away and there be will a major problem in terms of dealing with freight traffic at the port unless interim solutions are introduced.  The port tunnel probably will not be the solution because there will be a completely different set of circumstances which will require a completely different set of solutions. Therefore, provision must be made for freight traffic from the port pending the construction of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>A city is a living, changing and multi-purpose organism.  It requires two things in terms of transport to function efficiently.  It needs to move people and goods.  This may appear a simple demand but successive Governments have failed to organise either of these tasks efficiently.  The infrastructural projects which are part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative will, when completed, form part of the solution.  They will make a difference.  However, they will not make anything like the difference envisaged when the initiative was first put in place.  All the projections for 2011 on which the strategy was based in terms of job creation, employment figures, population figures, household numbers, freight movements and car ownership have already been achieved. Yet, all the projects that were designed to cope with that demand are running five years late.</P>
    <P>Interim arrangements are urgently required if the city is to survive as a functioning economic unit or even as a tolerable place in which to live. This is of great concern to the third of the population which lives in the Dublin area.  I dealt previously with how people should be moved in the meantime, but I stress the need for measures to deal with port traffic in the interim.  The importance of the port and its traffic cannot be over-emphasised. Every item used in the State from the time people get up in the morning until they go to bed at night must be moved by road.  Ireland is a small and open economy that is completely dependent for its survival on its ability to import and export goods efficiently and economically.</P>
    <P>Ireland markets itself to businesses considering locating here as the ideal launching point for speedy and efficient access to the European market. Dublin is the prime port through which the majority of our imports and exports pass at some stage.  The port is the country's lifeline to Europe and the rest of the world and it is being choked by our failure to address even in the simplest and easiest ways the issue of maintaining access to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> However, it is not only the country's economic lifeline that is being choked; the people and city are also being choked by our inability to deal with freight movement.  There are up to 8,000 truck movements in and out of the port daily.  The trucks are enormous, and getting larger.  They are up to 60 feet in length and weigh up to 38 tonnes. They are conflicting on the streets with pedestrian and other traffic movement every day.  No other capital city would allow such a position. The freight volume to the port has more than doubled in the last five years and the forecast is that it will continue to grow at the staggering rate of 25 per cent a year.  We should consider what that means in terms of truck movements conflicting with all the other uses the city must fulfil.</P>
    <P>Immediate solutions can be provided in terms of the three ferries which arrive at the port between 7 a.m. and 7.30 a.m. carrying up to 520 trucks.  They queue for up to an hour to get out of the port and then emerge into rush hour traffic. They are conflicting with everybody trying to get to work on foot, on bicycles, on buses or in cars. Nothing can be done about changing the time of arrival of the ferries because they are synchronised with English Channel crossings.  However, something can be done about managing access to and from the port.  We must consider the suggestion of a clearway for trucks, even during that critical hour in the morning, to ensure that they get out of the city on a designated and obligatory route to the M50 motorway.</P>
    <P>CIE made a number of proposals but I have reservations about them as an economically viable solution.  However, some form of bulk breaking facility is required at the M50 motorway and none of the 60 foot containers should be allowed back on the C ring of the motorway during the day.  They may be allowed on it at night, but only if it is necessary for special deliveries and by special permit.  It should be the exception rather than the norm.  Changes also need to be made to the operation of the port so that &ldquo;lo-lo&rdquo; traffic, which involves domestically based operators, does not arrive at the port at exactly the same time as the &ldquo;ro-ro&rdquo; traffic is leaving.  At present the container depots do not open until 8 a.m. and there is inevitable conflict.  It is causing a huge reduction in productivity at the port and ultimately affecting the cost of all goods and the economy.</P>
    <P>Interim measures should be taken while we await the construction of the port tunnel.  I welcome the legislation and I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House.  There are few issues of greater importance to the economy at present.  The tunnel will be redundant by the time it is completed unless interim measures are taken. The port, the city and the economy will be in rapid decline by the time it is built unless such measures are taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to clarify the power of local authorities to compulsorily acquire a substratum, which is a horizontal slice <Col N="367" /> of land for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel or a tunnel associated with a light rail development.  The Bill is general and from the point of view of road tunnels, it applies to all road authorities.  Regarding the Luas project, I favour the underground option for the city centre area and I am happy to support the Bill to facilitate such a move.  I am satisfied that a vote for the Bill is not a vote for the A6 route proposed by the National Roads Authority and Dublin Corporation as their preferred option for a port access route.</P>
      <P>I voted against a proposed variation of the Dublin City Development Plan, 1991, relating to the Dublin Port tunnel at Dublin City Council in September 1997.  That proposal made specific mention of the A6 route, which proposes a tunnel under the heavily populated residential area of Marino.</P>
      <P>The motion passed by Dublin City Council reads:</P>
      <P>That this City Council resolves to vary the Dublin City Development Plan, 1991, to include the Dublin Port Tunnel along the A6 route, with the deeper vertical alignment with the southern portals located as described in the July 1996 environmental impact statement, and with the northern portals located on the south side of the Coolock lane interchange.</P>
      <P>I voted against that motion because the correct route for the tunnel was not selected, as I said at that Dublin City Council meeting.  I note the Minister's assurances that this legislation does not take away from the statutory procedures that must be followed before any project can proceed which involves the provision of a road tunnel. The Bill does not authorise the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the tunnel goes ahead and in what form will be decided by the statutory motorways scheme and the environmental impact assessment procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993.  I am happy that the final decision will be made as part of a different process.  This Bill allows for debate on the tunnel as proposed by the National Roads Authority and Dublin Corporation.  I am disappointed that I first heard of this Bill when it was published on 16 December 1997, despite the fact that I am an elected member of Dublin City Council.  In spite of both formal and informal discussions, Dublin Corporation decided its elected members did not need to know of the necessity for this Bill.  It seems that the engineers were engaged in a deliberate conspiracy to suppress this information.  So much for the concept of partnership in local government between corporation, management, public representatives and citizens. Despite all the consultations and meetings, no official of the National Roads Authority or Dublin Corporation said that there was a legal doubt about the process which would need legislation.  I feel badly let down by this as I represent many <Col N="368" /> people who will be affected by the Dublin Port tunnel.</P>
    <P>I favour port access, which is vital to Dublin's economy and the port's viability.  A road tunnel may be the answer, but the A6 route is unacceptable for reasons I will outline later.  I do not believe that the Dublin Transportation Initiative gave sufficient consideration to the other options available.  The DTI came to the wrong conclusion.  Alternatives that are still available include a dedicated truckway, rail alternatives such as the rail centre proposed for Clondalkin and an east-west tunnel.  The Liffey tunnel would cost the taxpayer nothing because the private sector has proposed it.  If that tunnel goes ahead, and it is being encouraged at Government level, we could have two port tunnels.  Where is the wisdom in that?</P>
    <P>Prior to the election, Fianna Fáil stated that it favoured an agreed port access route.  It is not clear who will give that agreement.  Perhaps it is to come from Dublin City Council.  The Minister should note that 2,400 households in Marino are not in favour of the A6 route.  I pay tribute to the Marino Development Action Group.  This is a voluntary organisation established to highlight the problems of the A6 route.  They have many legitimate concerns.  As Deputy Olivia Mitchell said, this is a new concept for Ireland and it is only fair to hear the concerns of residents who will be affected by it.</P>
    <P>The Marino Development Action Group are concerned by adverse environmental impact, incorrect route selection, incorrect and unfair procedures, economic unsustainability, insufficient consideration for alternative traffic models, unsafe geological and hydrogeological conditions, the possible adverse sociological impact and incorrect criteria for determining route selection. That is a long list of concerns which has not been adequately addressed.  In relation to tunnel depth, residents continue to be concerned about building damage due to tunnel collapse and settlement as well as noise and vibration during construction.  This is serious if one's house is above the proposed tunnel route.</P>
    <P>In response, Dublin Corporation has agreed to a deeper alignment.  The new tunnel would be 5 to 9.5 metres lower than the original and houses would have a depth of cover of 19 to 24 metres to the tunnel crown.  Dublin Corporation stated that the deeper alignment would significantly reduce construction vibrations.  Time will tell if this route will go ahead.</P>
    <P>Another major worry for residents who will be affected is building protection and guarantees for householders.  Dublin Corporation claims that householders would have a system of guarantees overseen by the corporation to protect their property interests.  They have promised that a structural condition survey will be carried out on the houses over the tunnels and within a corridor extending 30 metres beyond the tunnel sides.</P>
    <P>A survey will be carried out by independent engineers, a householder will be free to choose <Col N="369" /> an engineer from the panel of three independent firms, the survey will be carried out in advance of construction and a copy of the survey report will be given to the householder.  During the construction work, comprehensive measurements of surface levels and vibrations will be carried out to ensure protection of properties, a second survey will be carried out after construction and the householder will be given the report.  In the event of any damage to buildings due to the tunnel, Dublin Corporation will arrange immediate repairs.</P>
    <P>The legal status of Dublin Corporation's information leaflet needs to be thoroughly examined. If the Minister gives the go-ahead to the A6 route those issues need to put beyond doubt.  One's home is one's castle.  People spend many years saving to buy a home in which to raise their families and developments such as this are bound to concern them.  Therefore, the legal position needs to be clarified beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>The question of vibrations during construction is another legitimate concern for residents.  Dublin Corporation states that, for each tube of tunnel, the effect of the vibrations will vary over a four week period.  The human perception of the vibrations will range from being barely perceptible at the start and end at a four week period, increasing to being more perceptible during the middle period while the tunnel tube passes beneath a given property.  That is not a very scientific measurement of the vibrations.  I do not know what it means by the vibrations becoming &ldquo;more perceptible&rdquo;.  Vibrations underneath one's home would certainly be a cause of grave concern. Damage was done to property, presumably by vibrations, when boreholes were being drilled by the engineers during tests to select the route. I saw the cracks that appeared in the walls of a home as a result.</P>
    <P>Residents are also concerned about the new Austrian tunnelling method, NATM, about which very little is known.  We know that on 21 October 1994 a tunnel collapsed at Heathrow Airport in London where rail tunnels were being constructed using NATM.  The engineers claim this is not possible in the case of Marino but that because of the particular geological conditions it is most likely the NATM method will be used. The residents need to know much more about the geological conditions.  Local anecdotal evidence on underground streams and rivers is at variance with data produced by the road engineers on the locality.  The people's legitimate concerns about this development cannot be ignored when discussing the current statutory procedures.</P>
    <P>How much will the tunnel cost?  Newspaper reports have stated that the costs are escalating. The taxpayers deserve to know the exact cost. They should know if the costs are escalating out of control.  For the reasons I outlined, I appeal to the Minister, having regard to all the statutory procedures, not to sanction a tunnel under MariNo. There are alternatives in terms of tunnels and port access.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> Like previous speakers, I appeal to Dublin Bus to provide a proper service during all hours of the day and night.  Last Sunday Dublin Corporation introduced restricted measures for parking in the city centre and substantially increased parking costs.  At the stroke of a pen it wiped out several places where people can park their cars.  Some people must drive into town to work because they work very late at night or have to be at work very early in the morning when there is no public transport available.  Female employees, who are terrified to walk the streets at night or early in the morning, must drive a car to their places of employment.  It is unacceptable that there is no public transport service available at such times. The DTI put the cart before the horse and is penalising the motorist without putting sufficient alternatives in place.  We are on the verge of a revolution in so far as motorists are concerned. The way to modify them is to provide sufficient public transport and I hope that will be done.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to the House.  We have no difficulty with this legislation which I am sure has all-party support and will be passed in the near future.  The Minister of State and I can note with satisfaction that construction is well advanced on the Lee tunnel without the benefit of this legislation. However, from a procedural and clarification point of view I realise it is necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey referred to the problems associated with transport in Dublin.  Even though I drive through the streets of Dublin only two or three days per week, I am aware of the transport crisis.  Plans are needed to deal with the problem. The proposed new roads and motorways must be built as soon as possible and if this legislation assists in any way, it must be supported.</P>
      <P>I note what the Minister said on Second Stage particularly about the two minor matters being dealt with in the Bill, namely, the judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and confirmation of the status of motorways. Judicial reviews of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes apply not only to the main schemes under construction in the Dublin area but to schemes throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport difficulties are being experienced in the capital city and elsewhere.  All local authorities have major proposals for the construction of bigger and better roads.  While the construction of these roads are welcome and necessary, environmental difficulties may arise and many people who are affected by such proposals seek redress, legal or otherwise.  It is important that every avenue of appeal is open to those who have objections to the development of motorways and main routes.  As a result of the clarification <Col N="371" /> offered in the Bill we can assure our constituents and the public that where genuine concerns have to be addressed, debated and adjudicated on, the ministerial avenue is still available and this legislation secures it.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the status of motorways and the clarification which the Bill provides, three routes are involved &mdash; the Southern Cross route, the Dunleer-Dundalk route and the Kildare Town bypass.  When is a motorway not a motorway? I presume what we are doing here is clarifying matters from a legal perspective.  Having travelled on all these routes I believe they come under the category of motorway.  I understand the Minister had to introduce this Bill to clarify matters from a legal perspective and we will support his efforts.</P>
    <P>This legislation grants powers to provide for tunnelling, if necessary, for the Dublin light rail development.  We have had a number of debates&mdash;</P>
    <P>

      <P>I was making the point that on a number of occasions we had lengthy debates and discussion on the proposed Luas system of transport.  I realise the Minister has ordered further studies but I hope they will be concluded and a final decision will be taken in the near future.  The transport problem in the city is so grave that the light rail option must be implemented at the earliest date.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, indicated earlier that as certain tunnelling works may be necessary it is imperative that the Bill is enacted.  That is another reason Fine Gael will raise no objection to this legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which is necessary to streamline matters from a legal perspective.  It is not party political and I am sure it will have the support of all Members on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Homelessness Problem: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Hayes on Tuesday, 3 March 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to put in place a comprehensive policy initiative to address the growing problem of homelessness and to provide a co-ordinated and comprehensive interdepartmental response to this growing crisis as it affects adults and children, with its related problems of crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>

      <Col N="372" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the comprehensive framework of measures in place and being developed in response to homelessness whether among adults or children, in particular the continuing action of the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal to secure effective mobilisation and co-ordination of the resources of the statutory and voluntary sectors in tackling adult homelessness; and the initiatives announced recently by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children in regard to alleviating the problem of homelessness among young people.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The most severe form of homelessness is that experienced by those who cannot secure even temporary shelter and are obliged to sleep rough.  Among the settled community there is a small number of such people.  The Minister of State mentioned that there were approximately ten such people in Dublin city on a given night. Despite the problem of drug addiction and other related problems, shelter can and should be provided for this group as a priority.  It is not outside the bounds of the imagination of the Minister of State, his officials and the voluntary agencies to come up with a solution to this vexed question.  It was done before at the request of Deputy Albert Reynolds when Taoiseach.  It can be done again.</P>
      <P>There is a much larger group of people who are forced to sleep rough permanently.  As far as I am aware, they have not been mentioned in this debate.  A total of 1,120 families from the travelling community live and sleep on the side of the road without the benefit of water and sanitary services.  This figure does not include families accommodated on permanent or temporary halting sites.  As travellers generally have large families, it is estimated that about 10,000 men, women and mostly children are condemned to these inhuman conditions which are so dreadful that the mortality rate among their children is ten times that of the settled community.  We have condemned these children to conditions that lead to their early death.  It is a measure of the degree of inherent discrimination in our so-called Christian society against these families that the death of children goes practically unnoticed.  If this was occurring even among the poorest of the settled community, there would be an outcry and action would be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main reason for the premature death of these children is that they have to sleep rough from the day they are born until the day they die. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and the Minister of State with responsibility for children should put aside any departmental <Col N="373" /> turf wars and pool their resources to tackle once and for all the scandal of children dying on the side of the road for the want of adequate accommodation. We can no longer use the excuse that we do not have the resources.  We must demonstrate that we have the political will to overcome the ingrained prejudice of the settled community and bring to an end this shame, scandal and blemish on our good name.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to what I describe as the Maynooth model where the local community identified a site as being suitable for development as a halting site for travelling families.  The families concerned have been living on the site where sanitary facilities are not as good as those in normal housing for seven years. The local authority and the Department have agreed to provide facilities on a pilot basis to allow the families concerned to sit down together to eat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are a number of socio-economic indicators of poverty and social deprivation in any society, in many ways, homelessness represents one of the most extreme manifestations of desperation and isolation.  In many instances, the homeless person has gone through a number of stages of deterioration in the circumstances of his or her life.  While the factors which can, ultimately, result in a person becoming homeless are varied and, sometimes, extremely complex and specific to an individual, one can be reasonably certain about a number of the circumstances of a homeless man, woman, teenager or child.  He or she is unlikely to have resources of any consequence outside the supports provided by State or voluntary agencies and organisations. Unemployment is almost a certainty.</P>
      <P>The homeless person will often have grossly inadequate clothing and is, therefore, very much at the mercy of the elements.  Allied to the risk of undernourishment, the health implications can frequently be extremely serious and must be a matter of grave concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A third consequence of homelessness is an ever increasing loss of self-esteem and identity. Research clearly indicates that once a person has got over the initial shock of finding himself or herself without a permanent home, a sense of apathy and hopelessness is likely to progressively develop until the individual sees no chance of recovering his or her previous status in life.  For those of us who have been fortunate not to experience such deprivation, it is impossible to <Col N="374" /> adequately describe the associated sense of loneliness and utter isolation.</P>
    <P>As if the combined impact of resource deprivation, exposure to the elements, illness and acute loneliness were not enough, yet another major hurdle lies ahead of an increasing proportion of homeless people.  Many such people suffer from one form or another of substance addiction.  While traditionally alcohol abuse was most closely identified with homelessness, the dire consequences of drug abuse are increasingly imposing an upward trend on the number of people without a permanent and secure place of residence.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that effectively tackling the problem of homelessness must be a priority.  This is particularly true in the context of a growing economy and ever increasing spending power on the part of the more affluent sections of society. While effective action continues to be a priority from a humanitarian point of view, it is in the vital self-interest of all members of society to deal with the problem of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Before considering some of the specific options open to us to effectively tackle homelessness, I wish to refer to two developments which will in no way help the cause of those suffering from the most extreme form of social hardship.  It is vital that all our efforts and contributions in this House are firmly focused on ultimately exerting a real impact on the problem of homelessness.  It is all too easy to proclaim loudly and at length on the issue while, at the same time, failing to propose a single effective step to counter the evil of homelessness.  Such an approach serves neither the victims of homelessness nor the stature of the political process.</P>
    <P>There is little merit in putting forward poorly thought out proposals or indulging in general criticism of the system.  Such an approach only confuses the situation and contributes absolutely nothing to the future well-being of the homeless. The only moral and responsible way forward is to fully acknowledge the complexity and diversity of the factors and circumstances which give rise to homelessness.  Similarly, the springboard for progress in this area involves a full recognition of all agencies and individuals, whether in the State or voluntary sectors, who have made and continue to make a substantial contribution in the primary and secondary campaigns against homelessness. Too often, an exclusive focus on the size of the remaining problem only acts as a serious source of discouragement for the many people who have achieved so much in tackling this appalling problem.</P>
    <P>I make a strong plea for balance in our approach to effectively and comprehensively tackling homelessness.  If significant progress is to be achieved in this area, there are a number of essential steps to be taken, many of which have been outlined by my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Molloy and Fahey.</P>
    <P>There is a need for substantial further research on the current level of homelessness.  The associated <Col N="375" /> trend over time is, equally, of vital importance. Research must help to establish an increasingly comprehensive profile of those who are being drawn into the homeless category.  A full profiling of the problem is an essential first step in the ongoing campaign against homelessness. The work under way under the direction of Dublin Corporation is likely to prove extremely useful in terms of providing an up-to-date benchmark of the problem.  Second, the various pathways of directly tackling unemployment need to be further developed and strengthened.  The programme of building 3,900 new houses during 1998 is a major practical step in the required direction.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme is substantial with £37 million paid in respect of related projects.  The rental subsidy scheme has also played a major role in effectively tackling the problem of homelessness. The facility which allows local authorities recoup related expenditure from our Department is being availed of to an increasing extent, reaching £6 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>The only prudent and responsible way forward is to maximise, to the fullest degree possible, all the information available on the problem of homelessness.  The issue is far too complex and diverse to offer any hope of significant success for any campaign or programme which is essentially one dimensional.  I stress the importance and the enormous potential of programmes such as the Dublin Homeless Initiative, which was established in late 1996 to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for homeless people in the Eastern Health Board region covering Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>It is only correct and proper this House keeps a close watch on the level of progress being achieved in the vital battle against homelessness in our society.  It is vital that all our energies and resources are focused on bringing relief to those afflicted by this terrible personal tragedy.  It is equally important to develop optimal support structures, recovery services and preventive strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in tonight's debate on homelessness.  This is a very important issue that is primarily the concern of local authorities and health boards.  I have particular interest in this problem because of the increasing levels of homelessness among drug users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the House a study carried out by the Merchants Quay Project between May and October of last year.  It showed that of a sample 663 first time attendees at the project, 93, or 14 per cent, of them were reported homeless.  It is reasonable to assume that sample study reflects a trend among Dublin drug users generally.  Given the profile of a typical heroin addict, the figures are not altogether surprising. <Col N="376" /> Heroin users tend to come from areas characterised by very high levels of social and economic disadvantage.  They are often poorly educated, have little or no employment prospects and, generally speaking, have dysfunctional family backgrounds. Many young drug users leave home due to family breakdown where parental conflict, alcoholism and parental drug use create an untenable living environment for them.</P>
    <P>The homeless drug users who presented to the Merchants Quay Project were reported to be leaving their homes or institutions to live in unstable accommodation such as hostels, sleeping rough, in squats, staying with friends or in bed and breakfasts.  Until recently the main source from which young people came was institutions such as residential care, prison or psychiatric hospitals.  A study conducted by Focus Point and the Eastern Health Board in 1989 found that 38 per cent of homeless persons in selected areas had been in residential care.</P>
    <P>More recently drug users who have left their homes in the suburbs and moved towards the inner city present to drugs and homeless agencies with various crises about shelter, health, the need for drug injecting equipment or legal support. Many simply attend to have a friendly space to rest in and to wash and change their clothes before going back on the streets.  There is evidence to suggest that this recent trend of young drug users leaving their local areas may be related to some extent to the growing activity of local resident and community groups which are seeking to create drug free environments in their estates.  As most drug users engage in supplying drugs to other users, the label &ldquo;pusher&rdquo; can be and is applied to many of them.  Some drug users will leave home and their area to protect their families from becoming the focus of local hostility. Others have been targeted by these groups for selling drugs and they respond to this pressure by leaving home.</P>
    <P>Of the 93 persons reported homeless in the survey conducted by the Merchants Quay Project, just over one third, or 34, were staying in hostels, with more males than females doing so.  Most hostels tend to give priority places to people who are over 25 years and as the demand on hostel places is very high, the remainder of young drug users have to seek other shelter options.  Almost one third of the sample, 29, were sleeping rough.  The next preferred option was staying with friends. Twenty-eight per cent reported that status and the friends with whom they were staying were more than likely injecting drug users.  Only 3 per cent of those surveyed were reported as squatting, while one person, a female, was staying in bed and breakfast.  Over half the homeless in the sample were new injectors, injecting only in the past year or so.  This recent behaviour coincides with high levels of risk taking, like sharing equipment by both borrowing and by lending.  This suggests either a low awareness of the risks of HIV and hepatitis C transmission and/or a difficulty in accessing safer injecting equipment.  With regard <Col N="377" /> to the health and wellbeing of the sample group, a quarter of the homeless drug users interviewed had overdosed in the previous three months, 8 per cent reported having hepatitis B, 17 per cent hepatitis C, 14 per cent had been to prison, 59 per cent were feeling isolated and 74 per cent were diagnosed as being depressed.</P>
    <P>Those statistics, which are based on a sample group, give a fair indication of the nature and extent of the problem citywide.  If the lifestyle of drug misusers generally is chaotic, those who are also homeless must lead particularly unstable lives and be in need of urgent intervention by the statutory agencies.  It is for that reason I requested the National Drugs Strategy Policy Group to examine the issue of homeless drug users and to report back to me.  In examining this matter, the policy group is availing of the expertise and knowledge of the National Drugs Strategy Team, which had identified this problem as one of the gaps in the action plans prepared by the local drugs task forces to tackle drug misuse in their areas.</P>
    <P>The lack of strategies to address this issue in the task force plans reflects the fact that homeless drug users tend to drift away from their areas of residence, thus making it difficult to cater for their needs in plans which are primarily locally based.  It also points to how difficult it is to plan for the needs of a clientele which leads a particularly chaotic and unstable lifestyle.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, it is an issue which must be addressed and I look forward to receiving shortly the report and recommendations of the National Drugs Strategy Policy Group on this matter, which is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to report to the House on progress in the implementation of some other aspects of the Government's drugs initiative because it impinges on the subject matter of this debate.  Deputies will be aware that the local drugs task forces were set up in the 12 areas in Dublin identified as having the highest levels of heroin addiction.  A task force was also established in north Cork city, where a significant drug problem exists.  The task forces represent a targeted and integrated response to the drug problem. They are focused in areas where the problem is at its worst.  They provide a mechanism for the relevant statutory agencies to co-ordinate their programmes and services in these areas and they afford an opportunity for local people to work in partnership with these agencies in developing strategies to respond to the drug problem in their communities.  All the task forces have submitted their action plans and, following their evaluation by the National Drugs Strategy Team, funding of £10 million has been allocated by the Government to support the implementation of those plans.</P>
    <P>The strategies contained in the action plans provide for a wide range of interventions by the statutory agencies and community groups to provide a locally based response to the drug problem. The interventions deal with education-prevention, <Col N="378" /> treatment, rehabilitation and supply issues.  The task forces have commenced the process of implementing their agreed strategies and the National Drugs Strategy Team is monitoring their progress.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also be aware that the Cabinet drugs committee established by the previous Administration has been reconstituted and is now a wider committee to tackle the problem of social disadvantage in its broadest sense.  This reflects the fact that problem drug use is just one of the symptoms of social and economic exclusion.  It is widely acknowledged that the best long-term solution to the problem of social exclusion, in general, and drug misuse, in particular, is to give young people in disadvantaged areas the same life opportunities as those who come from more privileged backgrounds.  This involves, among other things, the development of educational opportunities designed to meet their needs, the provision of sport and recreational facilities where they do not exist and better employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Cabinet committee last year initiated a review of the programmes being delivered to assist disadvantaged young people.  Arising from this review, the Government recently announced a programme for young people at risk, the centrepiece of which will be the young people's facilities and services fund.  The Government will commit £30 million to this fund over the next three years to enable a range of capital and non-capital projects to be initiated to entice these young people into healthy, life enhancing activities.  At least £20 million of this sum will be targeted at areas where there is a serious heroin problem.  The detailed arrangements for the operation of the fund are being finalised and I hope to present my proposals on this matter to the Cabinet subcommittee in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government has initiated and continues to implement an extensive programme of action to tackle drug abuse.  I am particularly conscious of the problem of homeless drug users and propose to give this issue my full attention in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak on this issue as many of the people who are homeless live in my constituency of Dublin South East.  We need to ask why at a time of economic prosperity homelessness occurs to such an extent.  We need more information on homelessness and its cause and effects.  We also need to act on the information we have and to ensure resources which are available are used to optimum effect.  There are no short-term answers to this problem, which is very serious and will take time and patience to resolve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The profile of homeless people has changed considerably in recent years.  Many homeless people are comparatively young and their homelessness is due to one or more factors, such as family breakdown, alcohol or drug addiction, <Col N="379" /> psychological problems or, because the economy is doing so well, they cannot stand the pace of life.  Maybe some of the homeless are quiet gentle people who will cause no harm to themselves or others and who have decided to drop out.  There are many different people in this group which means dealing with homelessness is often not only a question of providing accommodation but of providing services to assist people in dealing with and overcoming their problems and in helping them to cope by themselves.</P>
    <P>The answer is to co-ordinate the services provided by statutory and voluntary bodies and to develop strategies to shorten the length of time during which people are homeless.  We need services, in particular resettlement services, to help homeless people to move out of hostels and emergency accommodation towards independent living.  Often there is great resentment among the settled community to the establishment of centres for homeless people.  Unfortunately, people in my constituency objected to small numbers of homeless people moving into homes to help them move towards independent living.  That attitude is a fact of life in some areas of Dublin and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies have long been involved in providing accommodation and services for homeless people.  It is essential that the experience and expertise of voluntary bodies is combined with the resources available to the statutory bodies to provide the necessary accommodation and services for homeless people.  Under the Housing Act, 1988, local authorities are responsible for providing for the accommodation needs of homeless people and have provided funding, both capital and current, for this.  The powers of local authorities in this regard are extensive and varied.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have a range of powers to enable them to provide an effective response to the accommodation needs of homeless people. The maintenance of the local authority housing programme at a high and consistent level benefits the homeless in common with other people seeking housing.  A substantial part of the accommodation provided under the voluntary housing scheme administered by local authorities has been for homeless persons.  The terms and conditions of these schemes were significantly improved in 1997 and will continue to play an important part in meeting housing needs.</P>
    <P>Apart from capital funding, local authorities have wide and flexible powers under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, to provide or fund accommodation for homeless people.  This includes contributions to voluntary bodies providing such accommodation and meeting the cost of accommodation arranged directly by local authorities and by health boards on their behalf. Some 90 per cent of this expenditure is recouped by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  In 1997 the Department paid £6 million in recoupment to local authorities for <Col N="380" /> their expenditure in providing or funding accommodation for homeless people, including the emergency accommodation provided by the Eastern Health Board on behalf of Dublin Corporation and contributions to voluntary bodies.  This Government is fully committed to alleviating homelessness and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal has made it one of his priorities.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see the establishment of the Dublin homeless initiative which has been in operation for just over one year.  It was established to co-ordinate the provision of accommodation and services for homeless people in the Dublin-Kildare-Wicklow area.  Given that more than 60 per cent of homeless people are in the Dublin area and the number of statutory and voluntary authorities in the area providing accommodation and services for homeless people, the initiative was very welcome.  I am particularly pleased that the voluntary bodies have an important role in the operation of the initiative and I hope it will continue to develop.  Homelessness is often a complex matter requiring a co-ordinated response so the initiative's co-ordinating role is very important.</P>
    <P>There has been much public concern about the recent Simon assessment of the numbers sleeping rough in Dublin.  The figures quoted seem very high and I understand the Dublin Corporation estimate of people sleeping rough on a nightly basis is considerably lower.  While people may sleep rough by choice during good weather, it is difficult to visualise someone doing so in bad weather.  It is important to understand the dynamics of the situation so that the appropriate responses may be made.  I understand Dublin Corporation, in conjunction with Simon, is preparing an update on the number of people on the streets of Dublin.  I hope it will be finalised next week.</P>
    <P>We need to look at what can be done to provide accommodation for these categories of people sleeping rough.  The cold weather strategy which Dublin Corporation introduced in January 1998 to supplement the available accommodation in times of bad weather is an important step in ensuring accommodation is available for people who need it.  I congratulate the corporation on this strategy.  There is an increased supply of hostel accommodation in Dublin.  Dublin Corporation has a hostel in Maple House where it has 25 beds.  It recently got an extra four and is building an extension to accommodate an extra ten.  It also has Marlborough Place and is upgrading the model lodging house.  Many hostels have been redeveloped in recent years and now provide accommodation of a high standard.  The Dublin Simon Community premises on Island Street and Ushers Island and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul's night shelter at Back Lane are in my constituency. The Salvation Army Hostel at York Street, which is also in my constituency, has provided much needed accommodation for homeless men for many years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> The Government is providing funding for housing for people in need, whether through the local authority or the social housing programme.  Funding approved for this in 1998 is higher than ever before.  We cannot overlook the needs of homeless people.  I was reassured by the Minister's contribution to this debate and know he has a keen interest in this area.  I welcome his assurance that he will monitor the situation on a regular basis and will take whatever steps he can.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the corporation's review, which is very important.  There are, however, other areas in which we could have an immediate effect.  More move-on accommodation is essential to allow extra time to be devoted to helping people towards independent living.  Catering for the special needs of such people is essential and it will take time, money and much patience.  Many well trained and committed people will be needed.  People with special needs in this area need time and commitment.  It is a complex area where many things other than money are needed. Funding is essential and more should be made available.</P>
    <P>Everyone is uncomfortable and embarrassed when they encounter someone lying rough on the streets and people ask why this happens.  While two Governments have increased funding &mdash; Deputy McManus, when she was Minister, put much time and effort into the area and this Government has also done the same &mdash; more needs to be done.  There are no short-term answers.  Extra funding is needed, with patience and commitment, because these people need much care to guide them towards independent living.</P>

      <P>I thank Fine Gael for introducing this motion.  It is an important issue which is not given enough attention or focus.  There is a general concern among the public that, on the one hand, there is the success story of the growth in the economy, and on the other, tragic stories of children, women and men sleeping rough or in hostels or bed and breakfasts because they have no home of their own.  The profile of homeless people has changed considerably recently.  The average age has lowered and the problems have become more serious, especially in the areas of drug addiction and child sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister, I decided to make it a priority of my term in office to ensure progress was made in the area of homelessness.  I visited all accommodation units in the greater Dublin area and met the statutory and voluntary agencies. I was struck not only by their commitment and dedication but also by the lack of co-ordination on the issue of homelessness, even between the two Government Departments.  That <Col N="382" /> is how the homelessness initiative evolved.  I launched it in 1996 and provided funding for it. I am grateful to the Deputies who endorsed the usefulness of that initiative.</P>
    <P>However, better administration, co-operation and partnership is not the sole factor in resolving the issue and needs of homeless people.  Social conditions determine the level of homelessness and I am deeply concerned that we now live in a society where the political direction appears to be to deepen the gulf between the better off and the poor rather than building the bridges I believe are necessary.  When this Government came into office, it downgraded the role of the Minister for children and significantly reduced the allocation for the drugs task forces.  It was forced to backtrack on those two issues, by the UN Commission in one instance and by local communities, especially in the inner city, on the other, and to return the situation to what it had been previously. What concerns me most was evidenced in the budget where £40 million was effectively handed as a gift to what I describe as the undeserving rich.  Such a sum would have made a huge difference to the organisations dealing with the needs of the homeless in this city and around the country.  Through the reduction in capital gains tax, that £40 million has effectively gone into the pockets of the very wealthy in society.</P>
    <P>When we have money, and there is much of it in the economy at present, we have an opportunity to deal with homelessness effectively and in an integrated manner.  Money alone will not solve the problems.  Committed and dedicated political leadership and direction is needed, but we do not have that at the moment.  It is the greatest need and has been highlighted in terms of tackling the issue of child homelessness. Serious problems exist.  Dr. Anthony Clare described the Eastern Health Board as operating a fire brigade service of crisis management with no strategy to deal with the serious needs of children at risk or who are homeless.  Such a strategy must be put in place but it will not be if a system is maintained where a junior Minister without power and resources is left to carry the can for the failure, especially by the Taoiseach, to deal with this in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>One group of homeless people has not been mentioned.  They live on the roadside, often in appalling conditions.  Many travellers are homeless in a manner which has been tolerated for too long.  When I was in office, I set it as a priority to deal with the accommodation requirements of travellers.  I am extremely disappointed the Minister has not published the legislation to tackle this difficult issue.  It was promised before Christmas but we have yet to see it.  People should remember that many travellers who live in the most appalling conditions imaginable must be included when considering the needs of homeless people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McManus for sharing her time.  Homelessness is not selective.  It affects men and women, young and old, married <Col N="383" /> and single.  The ravages of social exclusion now bite deep at our children.  A recent Simon Community survey has shown that 70 people, or 46 per cent of the total number of homeless persons met during the compilation of the survey, were under the age of 25.  In addition, many less visible young people are out of home and live in highly insecure and unsatisfactory conditions, such as moving from one friend's home to another.</P>
      <P>A range of factors lead to a young person being out of home.  It is generally agreed that family problems are the most significant factor.  Conflict arising from physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect can make home life intolerable for a young person.  Those who were brought up in care are highly likely to become homeless &mdash; one third according to one survey.  There is also a significant link between early school leaving and homelessness.  Due to the absence of a coherent strategy and co-ordination between the voluntary and statutory sectors and the continuing breakdown in many families, the problem is likely to become more acute in the years to come.</P>
      <P>The drug problem is also a major factor in causing homelessness, especially among young people.  A survey published today shows that 53 per cent of young people have taken drugs, with little variation between urban and rural areas. This clearly shows drugs are freely available throughout the country.  It is obvious the increased seizure of illegal drugs by the Garda is failing to combat the problem.  Increased resources must concentrate on education and preventative measures to reduce the demand for illegal substances.</P>
      <P>Less accommodation is available today to homeless persons wishing to resettle than 12 months ago.  Funding for local authority housing is woefully inadequate to deal with the lengthening waiting lists and virtually no local authority housing is being offered to homeless people.</P>
      <P>The explosion of rents in the private sector has put this option out of sight for a homeless person. An effective resettlement programme is an essential part of making progress to eliminate homelessness. Serious pressures are being placed on our inadequate housing resources throughout the country, especially in Dublin, due to the shortage of land and increasing house prices.  The current social welfare system forces young people out of home to be eligible for many of the benefits.  This further compounds the problem and the demand for local authority housing.  A radical overhaul of the system is needed to encourage young people to remain in the family home with full entitlement and all the social benefits instead of forcing some of them on to the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, living at home is not an option for many young people on the streets.  Therefore, I propose that social welfare benefits and rent allowances be made available to young people aged between 16 and 18 years of age linked to participation in an approved educational or training programme. These young people are currently the responsibility <Col N="384" /> of the health boards but the boards are inadequately funded to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The ideal situation is for young people to remain at home with the support of welfare benefits instead of forcing them out.  However, homelessness will have to be tackled by extreme measures and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs should consider such a proposal which is being tabled on Committee Stage of the Social Welfare Bill.  We must urgently develop a strategy to target the needs of the homeless.  We must provide adequate resources to voluntary groups working with the homeless and we must declare zero tolerance on homelessness. Let us show that this House is taking action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the privilege of speaking on this Private Members' motion on homelessness and I regret to have to remind the House that in the past ten years in Ireland poverty has increased, exclusion and unemployment have grown and divisions have deepened.  Almost 60 per cent of unemployment is long-term.</P>
      <P>Over 30,000 householders are on the waiting list for rehousing.  This is an increase of 25 per cent in the past two years.  Statistics on the travelling community show that almost 1,500 householders are on the roadside or are in temporary caravan sites.  Almost 5,000 people are homeless today.  This has happened while the economy has expanded and inflation has been reduced to a very low level.  Obviously there is something seriously wrong.  The Celtic tiger has seen the national cake expand dramatically during the past decade.  However, the market services sector is the only sector where significant growth in employment has occurred.</P>
      <P>The groups who benefit least from success include unemployed people, low paid employees and other poor people, especially small farmers. For these groups, the poverty gap has widened and deepened the divisions in society.  Deeply divided societies are inherently unstable.  It is hardly too much to ask that every person in Ireland has sufficient income to live life with basic dignity, has meaningful work, adequate shelter and is able to participate in society in a real way.</P>
      <P>If Ireland is supposed to be doing so well why are there so many problems?  Why is the feel good factor missing for so many people?  The failure of this Government to tackle poverty, unemployment and exclusion, as experienced by one third of Irish society, is closely aligned to the narrow ways in which Government measures progress. The new programme should set progress indicators by which its success can be measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of people living in poverty in Ireland has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s. The depth of poverty experienced by people has been reduced somewhat.  However, it is clear that more than one million people are living at low income levels and a large number of these are experiencing severe deprivation.  The Government should adopt a target of reducing <Col N="385" /> housing waiting lists to a maximum of 18 months, assess the true scale of homelessness and allocate significant resources to providing appropriate accommodation for homeless people.  The time has come for the Minister and the Government to face up to their responsibilities.  Thousands of people are living in dilapidated houses and flats and travelling people are living in shelters and dilapidated caravans.  This is a problem and I urge the Minister to tackle it before it gets out of control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  There is no doubt that success surrounds us on all sides as we approach the millennium.  It would appear that we are running out of superlatives to describe the Ireland of today.  The economic indicators are brilliant and we are told they are among the best in the world.  The Celtic tiger is a success but not for everyone.  That is the issue which I wish to address.</P>
      <P>In the past we believed that a rising tide lifted all boats but it is clear that that is not the case. Some people are excluded from this society and those who are most excluded are the homeless. Exclusion is the new disease.  Those who are excluded cannot participate in the success and will not gain from the rising tide no matter what they do because there are so many barriers to their participation which they cannot deal with on their own.</P>
      <P>It is clear that structured Government initiatives are needed to tackle the problem.  It is also clear that we are not doing enough.  Statistics show this as do the experiences on our streets.  I welcome the initiative announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, yesterday.  We need special units for the most disadvantaged children who need security to save themselves.  Every other society has had to do this and we need to provide care and protection for the children who are most disadvantaged.  We must provide the range of services they need.</P>
      <P>Some of the children on our streets need structured help.  My colleagues have spoken of the range of housing initiatives which are needed. Deputy Hayes has pinpointed what needs to happen in terms of Government policy on housing and the disgraceful inaction.  I wish to speak about the services that some of these children need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These children have a history of truancy.  If we tackled this problem correctly we would not put these children on the high road to delinquency. Our record of helping children who cannot cope with the ordinary school system is a disgrace. Twenty years ago I worked in London and saw a range of services for children who were out of school.  I saw intermediate treatment facilities for 13 year old boys who could not cope in their schools.  I saw group work with children from the most disadvantaged families which helped to get them back into mainstream education.  We need a major initiative in this area.  We need a school <Col N="386" /> attendance Act and new resources if we are to prevent children ending up on the streets.  It is critical that we go back to the beginnings if we are to tackle the problem of homelessness.  This problem is not just about housing, it is about the way we approach children generally.</P>
    <P>Today I attended a seminar on women's health. Among the information given was that maternity hospitals can identify post-natal depression three days after the birth of a baby.  If we put the services in place to deal with the most vulnerable at the time when they most need help we would prevent many problems.  We are particularly bad at putting preventative services into place.  We need to develop the range of preventative services to deal with the most vulnerable children and to prevent them getting on the long highway to exclusion, failure in school and, for some, homelessness.  The numbers are getting very large.  We can see it all around us.</P>
    <P>Tonight I saw a young man in his mid-20s with a blanket around him standing at a corner on York Street in my constituency.  He was looking for money and was clearly homeless.  Other European capitals have had this problem for a long time.  The problem in Dublin is in many ways the beginning of a social problem.  It existed to a small degree in the past but it is now escalating out of control.  Ironically this is happening at a time when the economy is doing well and we have the resources to do something about it.  The money is there but the Government lacks the political will to give priority to this major issue.</P>
    <P>We need to put the necessary resources in place to ensure the cycle of homelessness is interrupted effectively.  Otherwise the problem will become as great as in London and many cities in the United States.  We must not lose the opportunity afforded by this motion to tackle the problem. If we do not tackle the social problems and disadvantage in some sections of the community and interrupt the cycle of homelessness the benefits gained from the Celtic tiger will be set at naught.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to prioritise this issue and introduce a major initiative which will ensure the necessary resources are allocated to this area. We have the second highest rate of child poverty in the EU.  We think we are a child centred society but there is no evidence to support this from a legislative point of view.  For example, we only recently updated the 1903 legislation and two juvenile justice Bills still have to be introduced. I recognise what the previous Government did and what this Government is trying to do, but we are only beginning to allocate the necessary resources to child care.  We are coming from an incredibly low base and our administrative structures do not work properly.  The relevant Departments are too divided and we are still not clear on who is responsible for the legislation.  This was evident from the slowness to give the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, responsibility across three Departments.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>We should hang our heads in shame that 13 <Col N="387" /> year old children have to live on the streets of Dublin.  All the hostels in Dublin are full and children and adults who are turned away have to sleep rough.  While there is an argument about the figures, they are substantial.  The Merchant's Quay project carried out a survey in my constituency a few weeks ago.  It found that 40 per cent of those sleeping rough are young women, many of whom are drug addicts.  Specific services are obviously needed to deal with this group.  The statistics are alarming.  According to Focus Point, the figure increased from 352 in 1994 to 599 in 1995 and 824 in 1996.  If we are committed to a just society, we must tackle the issue and allocate the necessary funding.</P>
    <P>I would have allocated the £20 million given to the GAA in the budget to tackling homelessness in Dublin.  I have no objection to the developments being undertaken by the GAA &mdash; I congratulate it on its contribution to society &mdash; but it is able to raise its own funding.  I would have used this money to break the cycle of homelessness before it gets worse.  A major once-off injection of funding would break the cycle of rampant deprivation.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the homeless initiative which is under way but it is not enough.  We must provide the statutory backup for this initiative.  We must also provide further funding and support to enable the many groups working in this area to provide the range of services required by people living in hostels, for example, accommodation, employment and counselling to help them move on.  The only way these organisations can give this support is if they receive ongoing funding.</P>
    <P>It is distressing to see the number of young people of different ages sleeping on the streets in Dublin.  We do not want the success of the Celtic tiger to create a two-tier society with a drift towards a level of social exclusion we have never seen before.  While many people were poor in the past, as facilities developed and educational opportunities grew they moved away from poverty. People will not be able to do this at present unless structured initiatives are introduced.</P>
    <P>The budget gave priority to the wrong areas. Funding should have been allocated towards breaking the cycle of homelessness.  We know the services which are needed and we must reach out to this vulnerable group of people and give them the necessary counselling, halfway houses and secure units they need.  We should not be hesitant about allocating the necessary resources to this area.  Otherwise the success of the Celtic tiger will be very shallow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the problem of homelessness.  If we do not carry out a comprehensive examination of the problems in this area we will face a major crisis in the coming years.  I support the points made by many people on this problem.  The level of homelessness in Dublin and other cities and towns is a cause of <Col N="388" /> shame and it is incumbent on us to remedy the problem.</P>
      <P>Many people live in mobile homes which are illegally parked.  These townships, so to speak, can cause problems for the occupants of nearby homes.  The Government must re-examine the provision of halting sites.</P>
      <P>The cost of halting sites can be between £75,000 and £80,000.  The cost of providing homes would be much less than the cost of providing such sites.  I question the wisdom of providing halting sites as distinct from homes.  Apparently, many feel they have a right to roam and travel with the possibility of moving caravans from place to place, but money would be better spent on providing homes for those living in caravans.  This issue deserves more indepth examination than it is receiving.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be well advised to examine court lists, particularly those of the Circuit Court which are furnished in each town at the commencement of sittings.  His officials should write to the county registrars in each Circuit Court area to receive details of court cases listed in which building societies and some banks are seeking repossession of homes.  Alarm bells will start ringing in the Department when he sees the number of orders for repossessions by building societies. There are roughly 40 cases pending for repossession of houses in Offaly at present.  It this is extended to the rest of the country the Minister will see there are thousands of homes under threat of repossession by building societies.  In the old days repossession was called eviction.  Sadly, many repossessions are taking place with many people being evicted from their homes.  The Minister should examine the circumstances to see if help can be given to those people being made homeless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>In summing up for the Government, I will comment on issues raised by Deputies who have spoken on this motion.  I will also summarise the Government's position on this important issue.</P>
      <P>The problem of homelessness is multifaceted. It has many complex origins and rarely arises in isolation.  Homelessness may arise as a result of family difficulties, alcohol or drug abuse, mental illness, unemployment or bad luck &mdash; this list is not exhaustive.  In addition, because of trends in the housing market, people entering the market may find the price of buying their first home prohibitive.</P>
      <P>As my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, pointed out last night, we are living through a time of unprecedented change in Irish society.  Many aspects of this change are beneficial but the benefits have come at a price and people who would have had a role in a more traditional society have been left behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people are particularly at risk in a situation where society no longer acts to reinforce the <Col N="389" /> family and does not promote social cohesion as was the case.  Problems which previously did not arise to anything like their present extent now fall to statutory and voluntary agencies to deal with, and these agencies are responding to the challenge. Young people can encounter particular problems with alcohol and drugs and while health boards and the health promotion unit of my Department are active in developing and delivering innovative programmes to help young people cope with these potential problems, we must recognise that there will be casualties. However, action is being taken in this area and the problem of young homelessness will continue to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The necessary legislation, the Child Care Act, 1991, assigns to health boards responsibility for promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and obliges health boards to provide childcare and family support services.  Boards are also required to make suitable accommodation available for children who are homeless.  Health boards must review their services annually and, in a more recent development, must submit service plans to my Department identifying priorities for each year.  My Department funds boards on the basis of these plans.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that very significant additional funding has been made available to allow the full implementation of the Child Care Act.  From 1993 to the end of 1997 an additional £43.5 million on an annualised basis has been allocated to health boards for this purpose and a further £8 million will be made available during 1998.  In addition, capital investment of £5 million is provided for in 1998.  This represents a very significant commitment by successive Governments to the development of childcare and family support services, including services for the young homeless.</P>
    <P>Investment in services for the homeless is directed to the areas of greatest need and is mainly targeted at the Eastern Health Board. There is no doubt that the Eastern Health Board, and the greater Dublin area in particular, has a wider range of problems than any other part of the country.  That is not to say that other parts of the country do not have to cope with the problem of homelessness &mdash; far from it.  It is merely to recognise that large urban areas have more than their share of problems.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, outlined last night the main developments which have been financed in the Eastern Health Board area.  These initiatives are designed to provide a practical response to the problem and also to resource the Eastern Health Board to deal with the problems it faces.  The Minister also referred to the need for an integrated range of measures to prevent problems arising in the first place and this is another area in which all health boards have responded so that they can provide the necessary supports for families in difficulty. <Col N="390" /> However, this is clearly an area that would merit greater attention in future.</P>
    <P>I now wish to address the broader issue.  While Deputy Stagg was kind enough last night to speak approvingly of what was being done in relation to homelessness among young people, he was somewhat critical in regard to adult homelessness.  This response was, I think, unmerited.  In his contribution earlier in the debate my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, outlined the situation in relation to homeless people, for whom he has responsibility.  He noted that while health boards traditionally had a leading role in providing accommodation for homeless people, responsibility transferred to the local authorities following the enactment of the Housing Act, 1988.  However, as health boards had developed a wealth of experience and expertise in assessing and responding to the needs of homeless people, they continue to be involved in this area.</P>
    <P>In particular, the arrangements in the Dublin area are a good example of co-operation between local authorities and health boards.  The Homeless Persons Unit is operated by the board.  It arranges emergency accommodation, as required, for homeless people on behalf of the Dublin local authorities.  It also deals with the income support requirements of homeless people.  In effect, it operates a one stop shop to meet the emergency accommodation and income support needs of homeless people.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Homeless Initiative, involving the Dublin local authorities, the Eastern Health Board and the voluntary sector, is a logical extension of this partnership arrangement.  My colleague and other speakers have paid tribute to the work of voluntary bodies in providing accommodation and services for homeless people.  I echo this sentiment.</P>
    <P>The procedures involved in providing accommodation and services for homeless people lend themselves to the flexible arrangements which voluntary bodies can provide.  While we obviously want services to be cost effective, we do not want to lose the flexible response which is a trademark of voluntary bodies.  In an increasingly complex society, it seems that more and more people have difficulty in coping.  As several speakers said, homelessness is often a complex mix of factors such as family breakdown, alcohol or drug addiction, etc., compounded by factors such as poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.  The response to homelessness, therefore, generally requires the provision of accommodation and other services.  Unless there is a safety net of supports available when people become homeless, there is a danger that some vulnerable homeless people will slip into the world of crime and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>I have referred, as have many other speakers, to the position in Dublin because nearly two-thirds of homeless people are in the Dublin area. While homelessness is largely a problem in the <Col N="391" /> large urban areas it is also a problem, albeit of a different type, in smaller towns and rural areas. Anyone can become homeless for a variety of reasons.  It is essential, therefore, that local authorities and health boards ensure that the necessary arrangements are in place to meet emergencies as and when they occur.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to meeting housing needs is clear from the record levels of funding approved for the local authority and social housing programmes this year.  Many homeless families are housed under these programmes but what is clear from this debate is the need for co-ordinated services and co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors to help homeless people find a route out of homelessness and back to more normal living.</P>
    <P>The powers of local authorities to respond to homelessness are broad.  Perhaps the most significant recent development has been the expanded local authority and social housing programme. The Government has made a commitment to maintain this programme.  Many homeless families have benefited from this programme and capital funding has been significantly increased. Social housing measures are being developed and they play an important part in meeting housing needs, including those of homeless people.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing capital assistance scheme provides high standard accommodation for homeless people as well as for the elderly and people with disabilities.  Since the inception of the scheme some £37 million has been paid in respect of projects for homeless people.</P>
    <P>Organisations such as the Simon Community, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Respond and the Salvation Army have availed of the scheme to provide 470 units of accommodation for homeless people.  In addition, a separate rental subsidy scheme funded by the Department of the Environment and Local Government has also been availed of by the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>There have been significant improvements in the range of voluntary housing measures to make them as attractive as possible to voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless people and other groups.  More direct assistance is also required and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has made this available to homeless people and the bodies working on their behalf.  Annual grants are made available to a number of voluntary bodies.  Local authorities have extensive powers and these powers are being used.  Funding is being provided and it is intended to continue with this policy.</P>
    <P>The Government has accorded a high priority to this issue and we stand over our record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of homeless children.  As my party's spokesman on children, I wish to dwell exclusively on this issue.  It is sad at a time when most people enjoy high standards of living that children are homeless on the streets of Dublin and other urban areas.  Homelessness represents the most extreme form of social exclusion and should not be a feature of society.  A mere 44 hostel places are provided for children in the Eastern Health Board area but that is totally insufficient. There are only six or eight emergency beds available each night but there is a requirement for at least three times that number to ensure that no child must resort to sleeping in squats or on the streets.  Hostel accommodation should only be a short-term measure until such time as services are in place to provide proper day care services for children supported by a 24 hour social work service with access to emergency fostering care, supported lodgings or home-family support services.</P>
      <P>Placing children in hostels or in bed and breakfast accommodation is not an acceptable alternative to providing hospital resources and professional skills and places unnecessary demands on resources.  Bed and breakfast establishments are excellent as private enterprises but the necessary professional skills are not available in these to deal with homeless children and their families.</P>
      <P>I pay particular tribute to Focus Ireland for the work it has done in this area and from which I have drawn most of my information.  Focus Ireland has drawn up a plan in which emergency needs and immediate requirements are outlined. Additional emergency accommodation must be provided as a matter of urgency.  Day services for homeless children should include basic facilities such as food, water, informal education and links with other services on a 24 hour basis.  Provision must be made for a seven day street work service.</P>
      <P>Focus Ireland has also outlined the need for settlement facilities and an increase of 60 places in foster care lodgings.  There is a need for 30 more supported lodgings, a home support service and care workers to support children in their own homes.  There is need also for a community service as well as independent living training in supported lodgings.</P>
      <P>The problem of homelessness must be tackled on a long-term basis.  We must examine our education facilities to understand the reason children become homeless at such a young age.  Nine, ten and 11 year olds are dropping out of the system so there is a need for better home-school liaison services and better support for neighbourhood youth projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services must be planned by the health board and must draw on the experience of the voluntary sector.  There is a need for an integrated service delivery system inclusive of the experience and <Col N="393" /> capacity of the voluntary service.  There should be a clear and cohesive strategy to ensure the needs of children, who are or are likely to be homeless, and their families are properly addressed.</P>
    <P>On 11 December last, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs mentioned figures with regard to referrals from January to July of last year.  He outlined that a total of 1,945 referrals were received and approximately 50 per cent of those were young people who were known to the Eastern Health Board.  A difficulty experienced by the out of hours service is that many young people who cannot be placed by community care teams during the day because of a shortage of places present themselves to the out of hours service at night.</P>
    <P>Has progress been made on the proposal that additional social workers will be available to the out of hours service?  What is the status of the plans to set up a day and night reception centre in Dublin city to facilitate homeless people in accessing health board services?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that trends in the housing market in particular cause problems of homelessness, but Government policy is causing the problems.  There are many homeless people and as a result of the budget the problem will be greater in future because many young couples cannot purchase homes.  The problem is evident throughout the country.  The Government is putting homes out of the reach of many people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said that problems can be identified at an early stage.  At a seminar today it was outlined that very often problems start when children are born, and they continue from generation to generation.  Primary school teachers can identify in junior infants future dropouts and homeless people.  I call for an immediate extension of the home-school community liaison service. There are too many reports and we are aware of what must be done.  A greater number of remedial teachers are needed in schools to identify problems at an early stage.  The pre-school service must be funded and properly set up.  Counselling services are needed in all schools. It is unacceptable that schools with fewer than 500 pupils may not have the facility of a guidance counsellor.  Primary schools also need guidance counselling.  We must immediately beef up the psychological service in the Department of Education and Science.  The Minister is aware of what must be done, and if those initiatives are taken now it would help enormously.</P>
      <P>There are people leaving school today who cannot read, and for that reason teachers are under tremendous stress.  The problem is not an urban one, it is also a rural problem but, as the Minister acknowledged, in rural areas it is not as concentrated.  The Minister said that there is a danger homeless people will become involved in crime and drugs, but it is more than a danger, it is almost a certainty.  I hope this debate will jolt the Government into action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> Homelessness is evident throughout the country. For example, in Cobh there are 300 families on the waiting list, but this year the Government allocated only 15 houses.  Is the Government serious about this problem?  I call on the Government to take this motion seriously and tackle the problem head on.  It should not rely on the voluntary service to do all the work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members on all sides who contributed to this debate which was very useful in highlighting a huge and growing social problem. Points were made by Deputy Stagg about the issue of travellers, by Deputy Fitzgerald about school attendance and by others about the treatment of children.  One third of children live in poverty and that is a national disgrace in the context of a booming economy.</P>
      <P>I am not happy the two Ministers charged with responsibility in this area are not in the House to hear my closing remarks.  I very much regret that the points I made at the start of this debate have not been responded to.  In particular the question of when the Government will publish the national strategy on homelessness, which is part of the programme for Government, was not answered. The Government has been in office for nine months and that strategy, which is a key aspect of housing in the programme for Government, has not been produced.</P>
      <P>I also very much regret the Minister, Deputy Molloy, did not respond to my statement that he, as Minister with responsibility for housing, is not a member of the Cabinet Sub-committee on Social Exclusion.  A very important Cabinet sub-committee is charged with responsibility for drawing up policy on social exclusion and the Minister, who has direct responsibility for that area, is not a member of the committee.  That is a disgrace which I highlighted to the Minister and the Taoiseach some months ago and which has yet to be resolved.</P>
      <P>It is clear from comments on all sides that there is a complete lack of co-ordination in terms of homelessness, as evidenced by the fact that there are two Ministers dealing with the problem.  The question of lack of information was not responded to in the debate.  We are working on housing statistics which were compiled two years ago.  It is clear from Simon and Focus Ireland that the figures on homelessness are out of date and bear no relevance to the position in 1998.  We must decide once and for all to make resources available to the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the Department of Health and Children to find out the exact scale of this problem.  We will not be able to develop policies and strategies unless we know the facts.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Fahey, announced, for the seventh occasion since January, his timely ideas about emergency care, and this side of the House welcomes that, but there was nothing new in his contribution last night.  It was a rehash of an announcement made in January of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> I wish to refer to the statement by the Minister, Deputy Molloy, about refugees.  We need to get the language on this issue right, and it was not helped by the comments of the Minister last night.  He said:</P>
    <P>There is significant pressure on emergency bed and breakfast accommodation and, indeed, on the lower end of the private rented accommodation sector, by the large number of asylum seekers in the Dublin area.  These are classified as homeless and are placed in emergency accommodation until they move into rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>This development has seriously eroded the otherwise adequate supply of emergency accommodation available for homeless people and has made difficult the move by homeless persons from emergency and hostel accommodation into suitable alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister was in the House tonight to remove that slur from the record.  It is inflammatory, dangerous and irresponsible language of which, if picked up by agencies outside the House, we will all be ashamed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> The homeless problem in Dublin has not been fuelled as a result of the number of asylum seekers. It is wrong for the Minister and the Government to blame refugees for this problem.  I regret that the Minister has not taken the opportunity to remove that slur from the record of the House. As I moved the substantive motion yesterday and as it was duly seconded it still stands and I put it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to debate this important issue for the city and particularly the people in my constituency of Dublin South-East.  The area is about to lose three hospitals &mdash; the Adelaide Hospital, Harcourt Street Children's Hospital and the Meath Hospital.  They will be replaced by the new Tallaght Hospital in June.  Tallaght undoubtedly needs a new hospital, but so does the south inner city.</P>
      <P>When the policy decision was made in the 1970s, Dublin was a different place.  The planners had a different vision of what a city should be; cities were places where people worked and conducted business and people aspired and were encouraged to live in the suburbs and to commute to work.  We witnessed the decline of the inner city population and the consequent spread of the suburbs.  However, that vision has changed radically. The planners and politicians want to create a living city.  People are now actively encouraged to live in the inner city, yet at the same time they are deprived of essential services.</P>
      <P>Since this policy decision was first mooted the population of Dublin 8 has increased one and a half times over to 30,000, roughly the same size as that of Leitrim.  Many new families are moving into the area, yet there is no hospital for them or for their children.  It is a devastating blow for a vibrant and growing community, and these people are justifiably very angry about successive Governments' failure to plan adequately for the future health needs of this area.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that if the Government proceeds with the decision to close these hospitals it will be a very costly mistake.  It is illogical, short sighted, irresponsible and even dangerous to close down hospitals in such a populated area. Have we not learned from the mistakes of the past?  Tod Andrews closed down the Harcourt Street rail line and boasted about it.  It seemed like progress then but now we regret that decision.  Now we wish to build the expensive Luas system at enormous cost.  We built Ballymun flats and now we wish to demolish them.  This decision falls into the same category and I urge the Minister to think long and hard before closing down these hospitals, particularly the Meath.  The Minister's reply will no doubt refer to the conclusions of the Working Group on the South Inner City Primary Care Needs Assessment, which was completed in March 1997.  It identified the problems likely to arise following the relocation of the Meath, Adelaide, and National Children's Hospital to Tallaght.  It recommended the establishment of a primary care centre and the enhancement of general practice and community services in the south inner city.  The working group recommendations included the following: a minor injuries unit, an out of hours on-call centre, public health nursing facilities, anti-coagulation clinics and in-patient beds for respite care.  In addition, the Eastern Health Board has identified the following health service requirements for the south inner city including a 50 bed unit for secondary rehabilitation for the elderly in particular. All of these services could be provided on the Meath Hospital campus.  The recommendations of the Eastern Health Board and the working group look good on paper and some are welcome, but it states categorically that acute hospital services are to be provided only from St. James, St. Vincent's and the Mater Hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not good enough and is unacceptable to the people who live locally.  An acute general <Col N="399" /> hospital with all the necessary facilities and equipped with the latest technology is needed. How will a minor injuries unit be able to deal with a child with meningitis or an elderly person who has just has a stroke or heart attack?  I ask the Minister to reassess Government policy and to intervene before it is too late.  I refuse to believe that this decision is irrevocable.  At a huge public meeting in the Olympic Ballroom it was suggested that if this was in the Minister's constituency, action would be taken to reverse the decision.  I agree with that conclusion.</P>
    <P>There is cross-party support at local level for the retention of the Meath Hospital.  However, the buck stops with the Minister.  I appeal to him given his compassion and common sense to rethink this retrograde decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an urgent need to review the hospital service for the south inner city area of Dublin.  There is enormous local concern about the closure of the Meath, the Adelaide and Harcourt Street Children's Hospital when Tallaght Hospital opens in June this year.  The decision to close these hospitals was taken many years ago.  I welcome the opening of the Tallaght Hospital, which is desperately needed.  However, the impact of the closure of the three hospitals on the inner city must be urgently examined.  It is abundantly clear that the health needs of adults and children in the area cannot be met if all three hospitals close completely.  Local concern has been expressed by 11,000 people who have signed a petition urging that services remain in the area.</P>
      <P>Why is another evaluation necessary?  The following factors make retention of the services compulsory.  The area has the largest elderly population in the entire country.  There is huge concern that the elderly people with little mobility, and often little finance, will not be able to travel far outside their own area for the medical help they need.  An appropriate service must be developed to meet the needs of this vulnerable group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local population want to retain an acute hospital in the inner city.  An immediate and urgent review of the health, medical and emergency care needs of that population is merited prior to the hospitals' closure given that 18 per cent of the children in Dublin 8 are under 15, which is twice the Eastern Health Board figure.  I am concerned that the closure of Harcourt Street Children's Hospital means that a huge number of families will not have easy access to emergency medical services in the area.  This will impact on the most vulnerable families, given the lack of public transport and the cost of taxis to go to Tallaght. Neither Crumlin nor Temple Street Children's Hospital are in a position to respond to this, and a service for these children must be put in place in the inner city.  The Minister should meet the board of Harcourt Street Hospital to discuss the type of services necessary and how <Col N="400" /> those are to be provided.  He must put those services in place.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the rejuvenation of the inner city and getting young families to move to the area &mdash; as seems to be happening given the statistics &mdash; then we must have appropriate medical care accessible to that population.  If the population is to have their medical needs met, a range of services must be left intact in the inner city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies for giving me this opportunity to clarify the situation regarding the closure of the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital and the opening of the new hospital in Tallaght.  I acknowledge the continuous representations of Deputy Eoin Ryan since I took office last July.  He has been in constant touch with the Minister and me with regard to local concerns about this issue.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will no doubt be aware, June 21 1998 has been set by the board of the Adelaide and Meath Hospitals Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital as being the opening date for the new hospital in Tallaght.  The state of the art facility will serve the large population in Tallaght and its surrounding areas who up to now have had, in many instances, to travel considerable distances for hospital care.</P>
      <P>I have been assured that by June 21 the Adelaide Hospital and the National Children's Hospital will have moved to Tallaght and, with the exception of 76 beds for specific programmes, the Meath Hospital will also have moved to Tallaght by that date.  It is intended that the acute psychiatric facilities currently provided at St. Loman's Hospital will transfer to the new hospital at Tallaght before June 21.</P>
      <P>Since agreement was reached on the development of the new hospital in Tallaght, it has always been understood that the three constituent hospitals would close once the new hospital is opened.  As the Deputies will be aware, the Adelaide, the Meath and the National Children's Hospital are voluntary hospitals and as such have full ownership of their sites.  When the services transfer to Tallaght, the hospital sites will be sold as the premises will no longer function as acute hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department, together with the Eastern Health Board and the hospitals concerned, have been examining the health service needs of the south inner city catchment population following the transfer of the acute hospital services to Tallaght. A range of services for older people in the area is being provided by the Eastern Health Board.  A 25 bed community nursing unit which has respite, extended care and day care facilities, is operating at Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital.  A 50 bed community nursing unit which will provide similar services is due to open on Monday next, 9 March, at South Circular Road.  In addition, St Monica's, a 45 bed long-stay unit at Belvedere Place in the North inner city, is due to open at <Col N="401" /> the end of this month.  Proposals are also being developed by the health board to provide secondary rehabilitation, extended care and day hospital facilities for older people living in the South inner city.  The possibility of acquiring the Meath Hospital campus for these and other primary care services is being examined by the Eastern Health Board.  More than 20,000 of the accident and emergency attendances at St. James's Hospital come from areas which will be served by the new hospital at Tallaght.  This is greater than the existing accident and emergency attendances from the inner city areas at the Meath Hospital.  A similar situation exists with regard to out patient attendances.</P>
    <P>The factors which determine the levels of patient attendances at outpatient and accident and emergency departments are complex and difficult to predict with any certainty.  However, I am satisfied that St. James's Hospital, given its excellent record in innovative health care planning will, in association with the other health care providers in the city, continue to meet the needs of the South inner city population following the opening of the hospital in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>It is often said the hallmark of a civilised society is the manner in which it treats its weakest and most vulnerable sections.  When we examine the way in which those with a mental handicap and their families have been treated in this country, we certainly cannot claim any exceptional degree of civilisation.  It is difficult to think of a group of people more deserving of support from society than those with a mental handicap.  They are an exceptional group of people, many of whom go on to considerable achievement despite their handicap, but there are those who will always be dependent on others to provide for their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about this area will be overwhelmed by the love and care lavished on these people by their families and the trojan work done by voluntary organisations active on their behalf.  What causes most anger and frustration to those voluntarily involved in the care of the handicapped, whether families or groups, is that the more work they do and the harder they try, the more content the State seems to be to wash its hands of its obligations and to load even more work and responsibility on to families and the voluntary sector.  This is a political issue, but it should not be a party political one.  In the aftermath of the general election, I specifically suggested that it could be taken out of the party political arena by all parties agreeing on a programme of funding to meet the needs identified by health boards and in the national intellectual disability database.  This programme <Col N="402" /> would then be honoured, regardless of the party or parties in power.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there was no response to my offer and inevitably voluntary organisations like the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped are left with no alternative but to lobby, press and harry politicians.  The lobbying has increased, given the deep disappointment felt by that association and others at the allocation of just £7 million in the budget for the needs of those with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>There are 2,400 people with a mental handicap on waiting lists and there are 1,000 people with a mental handicap residing in appalling conditions in psychiatric hospitals who should not be there. People with a mental handicap have no statutory right to a service and they and their families have to depend on the benevolence of the State.  Those families who have a service have no guarantee that it will be permanent and their service can be discontinued at any stage.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a public meeting in Limerick of parents of people with a mental handicap. In the past we referred to children with a mental handicap, but many of them are now in their fifties and sixties with ageing parents who are concerned about what will happen to their children when they pass on.  A member of the executive of NAMHI told us that a single 40 year old woman who was caring for her 50 year old sister was recently hospitalised because of the pressure of the work she was doing.  While she was in hospital her sister was taken into care but when she was discharged from hospital her sister was also discharged. She could not get any respite care until a member of the executive of NAMHI intervened with the officials of the Mid-Western Health Board who managed to find a place for her.  In the short term that woman is not in a position to continue to care for her sister on a 24 hour basis every day of the year.  It is literally killing her. That type of experience can be multiplied by thousands</P>
    <P>To deal with all of these matters will require legislative and spending measures over a number of years, but to deal with the most pressing needs NAMHI asks that the allocation of £7 million for 1998 announced in the budget should be increased to £25 million.  This is a modest amount, particularly at a time when the Exchequer is literally awash with money.  A sum of £25 million represents less than half of one per cent of the money the State will take in income tax alone during 1998.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, the urgent need to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to provide the money that is necessary.  It is not as if it is not available.  The Minister of State will have the support of every Member of the House if he takes that action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy De Rossa for his contribution.  I appreciate his sincerity about this issue, which pulls at the heart strings of every <Col N="403" /> politician.  However, I am sure the Deputy, having spent some time in Government, understands better than most the inherent difficulties with Supplementary Estimates.  The desirability of Supplementary Estimates is always overruled by the importance of the strict guidelines to which the Department of Finance make us adhere.  I am sure every Member of the House would like support for those with a mental handicap and their families.</P>
      <P>My Department's Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, based on information from the national intellectual disability database, provides information on the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  That assessment identifies a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question.  It is estimated that the cost of providing these services during that period would be in the region of £63.5 million.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Cowen, was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million in 1998 to continue the process of delivering the services identified in the assessment of need. This funding includes £10.75 million in revenue and £5.25 million in capital and is being used to meet the needs in existing services and to provide new residential and day care places.</P>
      <P>The capacity of existing facilities to absorb the additional places in the coming years and to provide the specialist services for disturbed clients is limited.  A programme of building is essential to deliver the volume and quality of services required.  Late last year the Minister announced a new capital programme of £30 million which he has put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in the assessment of need.  Over the next four years this capital programme will provide for new residential and day care facilities and the upgrading of existing facilities; the provision of alternative accommodation for persons with a mental handicap currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and the upgrading of existing facilities which will continue to be used in the medium to long term; and the provision of facilities for persons with a mental handicap who require specialist services in a secure environment.  Details of the capital programme are being discussed with the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies.</P>
      <P>As outlined in Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Tá mé fíor bhuíoch go bhfuil deis agam labhairt faoi áras na nGardaí i Muine Bheag.  It is a reasonably long story.  In November l995 I contacted the then <Col N="404" /> Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, who acknowledged my representations.  In November l996 the Department of Justice decided to allocate £60,000 for renovations in the Garda station. The renovations included the incorporation of the married quarters into the Garda station, to provide space on the ground floor for an interview room, sergeant's office and a proper public reception area.  Extra space was to be provided on the first floor for a rest room, ladies toilet and shower facilities.  The kitchen, recreation and locker rooms, store, male toilet and shower facilities and the electrical system were to be upgraded as well as providing oil fired central heating.  This proposal went to tender under the then Minister, Deputy Owen.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in September to which I received an acknowledgement on 1 October l997.  I received a letter on 31 October l997 which stated:</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter of 24 September l997 regarding Bagenalstown Garda Station.  As you are aware it is proposed to refurbish the Garda Station at Muine Bheag.  Tenders were invited earlier in the year but only one contractor responded.  As the price was well in excess of the expected costs it was decided to defer the project.  It is hoped that the contract will be retendered and placed, perhaps, later in the year l997 or in l998.</P>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question for written reply asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the position regarding renovations to Muine Bheag Garda Station.  There is potential in the Minister's office for a comedy writer.  The reply stated that it is proposed to refurbish the Garda Station at Muine Bheag.  That decision was made in December l996.  I did not ask for a history lesson.  History, in all its aspects is a thing of the past, I wanted to deal with the present and the future.  One third of the reply I received is a history note.  The reply states that it is understood that the Office of Public Works intends to seek tenders with a view to placing a contract for the work this year.  That has been understood by the people of Muine Bheag for almost two years and by the Garda who go beyond the call of duty in turning up for work in accommodation which is not up to the standard of any factory, and could walk out.  The building is an eyesore in the town and the tidy towns committee has always regarded it as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That reply, which stated it is proposed to refurbish the Garda station, and it is understood that the Office of Public Works intend to seek tenders, was an insult to any democratically elected TD.  A commitment was given two years ago. That reply is not information, it is rubbish.  It is a generalisation that says I should not bother somebody in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I object to that type of reply.  It is not good enough to give it to any Member and it certainly does not befit the Minister for Justice, <Col N="405" /> Equality and Law Reform and his Department.  I do not wish to belittle the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, whose attendance I appreciate.  I ask that serious treatment be given to my request because the people of Muine Bheag and I are getting fed up of the condition of the Garda station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé áthas ormsa an cheist seo a phlé leis an Teachta de Brún agus an scéal a thabhairt dó faoi an obair ar staisiún na nGardaí i Muine Bheag.  As the Deputy has eloquently pointed out, there are proposals for the refurbishment of the Garda station at Muine Bheag. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is aware that the accommodation provided there is less than adequate and fully appreciates the need for improvements.  As I understand matters, the station is in a rundown condition and lacks basic facilities such as an interview room, doctor's room and proper toilet and washing facilities for members.  The station, in its present condition, is somewhat of an eyesore in the town.  However, I suppose persistence works and the Deputy will be glad to know that work on the station is being afforded a high priority.  The work which it is proposed to carry out to the station includes some demolition work to remove partitions so that better use can be made of the internal space and to incorporate the old married quarters.  Windows and doors will be replaced and the electrical and plumbing systems will be upgraded.  Fire safety features will be upgraded.  When the project is complete the Garda station will have a public office and reception together with a doctor's room, interview room and toilet facilities on the ground floor.  The upper floor will have a dining and recreation facility together with locker room, <Col N="406" /> toilets and storage facilities.  The building will be redecorated throughout and will be brought up to a modern standard.</P>
      <P>This work was scheduled for last year and the Office of Public Works put the project out to tender. The problem was the only tender for the work received greatly exceeded the provision which had been earmarked in the Garda building programme for the project.  It was not possible, therefore, to proceed with the project since there were insufficient funds available given the other priority works which were needed in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the consistent efforts of Deputy Browne in this respect.  The former Deputy for Carlow, Mr. Nolan, has constantly reminded the Minister of this matter &mdash; and myself in recent weeks since I have a small role to play in the Department.  With former Deputy Nolan, the Deputy can claim some credit.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that funding is now available for the project.  I ask the Deputy to share the good news with my old friend M.J. Nolan.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and those from the Office of Public Works, are updating the tender documentation with a view to seeking tenders for the project shortly.  It is hoped that a contract can be placed before the summer.  I understand that the work will take about three to four months to complete.</P>
      <P>With all that good news I am beginning to wish I was a garda in Muine Bheag.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 March 1998.</P>

      <P>My Department's initial response to the problem was to make chief executive officers and management of all health agencies fully aware of the year 2000 issue.  My Department is also organising a series of information seminars in relation to the Year 2000 issue and these are being held currently. The Department's policy is to encourage a co-operative effort between health agencies wherever possible.</P>
      <P>As this is a unique situation, there are no tried and tested approaches to the problem.  Health agencies are heavily dependent on suppliers of systems and equipment in relation to the year 2000 generally and particularly in the area of embedded systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each health agency is addressing the problem from its own perspective and in the way that best suits their own circumstances.  Typically, the information technology is being addressed by the management services units while the embedded systems aspect is being addressed by the technical staff, either technical service officers, engineering or medical physics staff as appropriate.  Virtually all boards have formal steering committees in place to oversee the necessary remedial action.  In <Col N="408" /> the boards that have not, the work is overseen by senior management.</P>
    <P>The first step in addressing the problem was to develop an in-depth inventory of systems and equipment.  Agencies are required to identify each and every item of equipment in use and assess whether there are any year 2000 implications. Each item on the inventory is prioritised. Then, items are assessed for year 2000 compliance. This work is ongoing.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say with certainty when all systems will be compliant.  Health agencies are approaching the issue from a business continuity perspective and will be ensuring that systems which pose a threat to public health are addressed on a priority basis.  Senior managers are fully aware of the problem and will be working towards compliance for all business critical systems well in advance of the due dates.  Health agencies will be expected to be year 2000 ready well in advance of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Government policy on this area is quite clear. The year 2000 issue should not cause any interruption to services which are provided to clients over the period of the coming of the new millenium.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national cancer strategy, published in November 1996, is aimed at providing an integrated, comprehensive set of cancer treatment services comprising surgery, oncology and radiotherapy. The strategy was developed and agreed following an extensive process of consultation, involving <Col N="409" /> experts and organisations working in the fields of cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and palliative care.</P>
    <P>The strategy includes a plan for reorganising cancer treatment services around three supra-regional centres, in which all of the major treatments for cancer will be available.  Linked to the supra-regional centres will be a set of regional services in designated hospitals, which will each provide a multi-disciplinary cancer service for patients within its area.  Patients requiring more specialised services, including radiotherapy, will be referred to the appropriate supra-regional service.</P>
    <P>The focus of the strategy is to provide comprehensive services in a designated set of high-quality centres.  The centralisation of all cancer treatment services in any one particular institution would be expensive and cumbersome, and would not necessarily be to the benefit of patients, particularly in terms of access to services.  Instead the strategy promotes close co-operation and co-ordination of services between hospitals and the development of regional self-sufficiency in appropriate specialties.  I believe that the cancer strategy adopts the best practical approach in this regard.  It emphasises the development of best practice and the promotion of agreement at local level as to which hospital is best placed to provide each type of cancer treatment.</P>
    <P>An action plan to implement the strategy was announced in March 1997.  It included details of a national cancer forum to advise on implementation of the strategy and it announced the appointment of regional directors of cancer services for each area.  The regional directors are making considerable progress already, thanks to their own commitment and the hard work of many others in the field of cancer prevention and treatment.  The directors are currently drawing up regional plans for the development of services in their area, which are being funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am committed to implementing the strategy as set out in the action plan.  This year I provided £7.7 million for implementing the strategy, which is in addition to the £6 million provided for this purpose in 1997.  In addition to this investment, £1 million was allocated in 1997 and again this year for the development of a national breast screening programme.  The screening process is due to commence in September of this year.</P>
    <P>A pilot programme of cervical screening is also in preparation in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  I allocated £300,000 to this important project this year.</P>
    <P>I have also provided the necessary funding for providing new consultant-based services throughout the country in oncology, haematology, histopathology and palliative care.  This will be implemented on a phased basis over the next few years and will ensure regional self-sufficiency to the greatest possible extent consistent with the provision of high quality services.</P>

      <P>Cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.  This is the schedule of control which, according to the UN Conventions on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, must be applied to substances such as cannabis and cannabis resin, for which there is no current recognised medical or scientific use.  The manufacture, possession, supply, and prescription of the drug are prohibited, except under licence from the Minister for Health.  Such licences may, under the law, be only granted for the purpose of research, forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential starting material for the manufacture of other drugs.</P>
      <P>The question of legalising cannabis is raised from time to time with frequent references to the medical and other benefits, which allegedly would be associated with such action and I am aware that claims are made about possible benefits for patients suffering from certain conditions such as multiple sclerosis and glaucoma.  The position is, however, that the medical claims being made in favour of cannabis are not supported by clinical research and there is to my knowledge, no such scientific evidence available.</P>
      <P>We have in this country strict controls in relation to the licensing of medicinal products which must take into account the possible side effects of such products on those to whom they are to be administered.  I doubt whether our knowledge of cannabis or its active constituents is such as to allow its licensing as a medicinal product.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Flunitrazepam, which is the active ingredient in Rohypnol, and its preparations have been classified as schedule 3 controlled drugs, under our Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, since 1993. The action now being undertaken in the United Kingdom will bring the situation in that country into line with what has pertained in this country for the past 5 years.  The drug was reclassified in <Col N="411" /> this country in 1993 in response to various reports of misuse and as a result unauthorised possession became an offence and it has been made more difficult for drug misusers to gain access to it. Doctors prescribing Rohypnol must comply with the special prescription writing requirements as set out in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988. Furthermore, persons, such as doctors and pharmacists, having the drug in their lawful possession must keep it in safe custody in accordance with requirements of the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations, 1982.</P>

      <P>Prohibitions and restrictions on tobacco advertising are an important part of public health policy on tackling smoking.  Existing national controls on tobacco advertising are quite restrictive. Advertising is restricted to newspapers and magazines and not permitted in publications directed primarily to persons under eighteen years of age. The content of advertisements is also regulated. The amount of money that tobacco companies may spend on advertising and sponsorship is strictly controlled.  Companies have not been allowed increase their annual spending in real terms since 1985.  In 1996 and 1997 cuts of 5 per cent were made in approved company advertising and sponsorship budgets.</P>
      <P>I have recently agreed new anti-smoking measures at European level involving a complete ban on advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products.  While there are a number of further stages to be completed before we finally adopt the measure I am confident that it will be successful. I intend to introduce the necessary legislation to give effect to the measure as soon as possible.</P>

      <Col N="412" /> I will continue to develop the dental services in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.</P>
    <P>The action plan provides for the extention of dental treatment to all adults with medical card entitlement on a phased basis under the dental treatment services scheme.</P>
    <P>In the initial phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 November, 1994, emergency dental treatment was made available to all adults.  Routine dental treatment and priority full denture treatment was made available to persons 65 years of age or older.</P>
    <P>Under the second phase of the scheme, which commenced on 1 June 1996, routine dental treatment was extended to persons in the 16-34 year age group and full denture treatment was extended to all edentulous persons.</P>
    <P>All health boards also operate a priority waiting list for dental treatment for medically compromised persons who are given priority irrespective of age on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>I will extend routine treatment under the scheme to persons in the 25 to 64 year age group according as the necessary additional resources are available.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>Some limited research has been undertaken on the issue of child prostitution in Ireland.  The following are details of studies on the issue which I am aware of:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; Towards an investigation of prostitution among homeless boys in Ireland, John Leinster, Trinity College Dublin, 1991.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Street Children Report, Barnardo's Dublin 8, December 1996.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Children on Inner City Streets in Dublin, Barnardo's Research, 1997.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Report of the Working Party on Children in Prostitution, Eastern Health Board, 1997.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Prostitution in Waterford city &mdash; A Contemporary Analysis Niall McElwee and Kevin Lalor, 1997.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is currently preparing a report that will assess the nature and extent of prostitution in the region; identify the risk factors that affect both young people and adults entering into prostitution; and make recommendations, in consultation with other statutory and voluntary agencies, for services to address the needs of those who are likely to become involved in prostitution, those who are currently involved and those who wish to leave. The report is due to be finalised in April.</P>
      <P>There are no accurate figures available on the extent of child prostitution in Ireland.  However, a recent Eastern Health Board working party investigated the scale of the problem in the region.  The survey identified 47 children and ten young people aged 18 or over who were involved in child prostitution at some stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the North-Eastern Health Board region community organisations and health board staff have identified a problem in relation to the sexual exploitation of children in the Dundalk area and the board has initiated meetings with all relevant agencies in the area to discuss the issue including the Garda, the Local Authority and the Department <Col N="414" /> of Social, Community and Family Affairs. The board has also commissioned an expert on the subject of child prostitution from the United Kingdom to come over to the region and discuss the issues in a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency forum.  Following the launch of the research on prostitution in Waterford city, a working group, which has health board representation, was established and the South-Eastern Health Board is awaiting its findings.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board is currently examining the survey carried out by the Eastern Health Board with a view to conducting a similar exercise in its area.  Within the board there are linked groups examining prostitution, for example, the sexually transmitted diseases clinic. In addition, a Garda based in Cork has special responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>It is important to view the activity of children engaged in prostitution in a child protection context. As such, reports of child prostitution are subject to the 1987 child abuse guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Children and the 1995 procedures for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda.  Health boards are aware of the risk to young people.  Any relevant information is relayed to the Garda and I am aware that the Eastern Health Board and the Garda have worked together successfully on specific cases in the past.</P>
    <P>In its review of available literature and taking account of the clinical experience of the staff in St. Clare's unit in Temple Street, the Eastern Health Board report noted that, among the pathways into child prostitution are combinations of the following factors: sexual abuse in childhood, leaving home at an early age, having a history of child abuse, having parents with histories of involvement in prostitution, growing up in a criminal sub-culture, sexual confusion-orientation problems, and being &ldquo;groomed&rdquo; by paedophiles.</P>
    <P>A very significant finding from the survey carried out by the working party in the Eastern Health Board was that 46 of the 57 children identified as having an involvement in child prostitution, that is over 80 per cent, either had, or were, experiencing homelessness.</P>
    <P>The central recommendation of the report was that sufficient numbers of quality placements should be made available which children could readily access and the board is acting on this recommendation.  The board is continuing to develop family placements, including additional carer families and supported lodgings, for teenagers and it also plans to develop three localised emergency residential facilities in suburban areas over the next three years.</P>
    <P>As a further measure, late in 1997, my Department approved additional funding of £100,000 to the Eastern Health Board to assist in tackling the backlog of fostering assessments.  Plans are also advancing for a day-and-night reception centre in Dublin city centre to facilitate homeless young people in accessing Eastern Health Board services. <Col N="415" /> It is intended that young people wishing to access the out of hours service will go to the centre instead of a Garda station as is currently the case.  The centre will also have six beds to accommodate young people who are unable to access more regular placements and will provide a gateway to specialist services such a medical, psychiatric and drug treatement.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board report also recommended that more formal links need not be established between all the voluntary and statutory services to maximise communication, co-operation and co-working.  Responsibility for this recommendation and the remaining recommendations rests with the Eastern Health Board and working group plans to meet again in June 1998 to review the progress of the implementation programme.</P>
    <P>Of course the ideal solution is to prevent the drift of children into prostitution in the first place. The range of early intervention services to young people at risk including neighbourhood youth projects, the day project for out of home young people, after school projects, after care services in child care and family support services generally all serve to reduce the risk of involvement in prostitution by young people</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine on the prohibition of the cloning of human beings is open for signature to only those States which have signed the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.  Ireland is not a signatory to the convention and we are therefore not in a position <Col N="416" /> to be able to sign the additional protocol.  The reason Ireland is not a signatory to the convention is that there are difficulties with some articles which have implications for the destruction of embryos.</P>
    <P>Ireland is supportive of measures currently being taken at a number of international fora to prohibit the cloning of human beings.  In particular, Ireland supported the decision of Heads of State and Government, meeting at the Second Summit of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 10-11 October 1997 &ldquo;to prohibit all use of cloning techniques aimed at creating genetically identical human beings&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. Additional funding of £100,000 was subsequently provided in May 1997 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew.  Total additional funding of £200,000 has been provided in this year's allocation to the South-Eastern Health Board to meet the full year cost of this enhanced service.  As a result, a total of 42 patients are now attending the unit each week.</P>
      <P>The board had requested additional funding towards the cost of further developing its renal dialysis service to meet a continuing increase in demand for the service.  This will be considered by my Department in consultation with the South-Eastern Health Board in the context of the board's own identified priorities for service developments and the overall availability of resources in 1999.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 44 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>In regard to a possible inconsistency between Bunreacht na hEireann and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Deputies should note that in giving consideration to ratifying any convention, one of the issues examined by the Office of the Attorney General and by the Government Departments involved is the compatibility of the convention which it is proposed to ratify both with the Constitution and with existing Irish law. This examination was carried out in the case of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and no inconsistency was identified.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who led the Irish delegation at the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child hearing, apart from the unenumerated personal rights of the child which are constitutionally protected, children share the general constitutional rights of adults.</P>
      <P>In regard to the full incorporation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into Irish law, I would make the point that the Child Care Act, 1991 is the main statutory basis for our existing child care system.  This Act was drafted when the UN Convention was being developed and it is fully compatible with the convention.  I am not satisfied that any major revision of our existing legislation is required as a result of the UN Committee hearing but this issue is being examined at present.</P>
      <P>As I said in response to Deputy Shortall's priority question on the UN convention the observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in regard to Ireland's implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child are being considered in my Department at present.</P>
      <P>Issues relating to publicising the convention will be considered in the context of this examination. In addition, and in accordance with a commitment given by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who led the Irish delegation at this hearing, a Dáil debate will be held on the issue.</P>
      <P>Documentation relating to the hearing will be made available and arrangements are also being made to conduct a joint publicity campaign in conjunction with the Children's Rights Alliance to publicise the provisions of the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may wish to note that the Department of Foreign Affairs has organised a forum <Col N="418" /> for NGOs on human rights issues to be held on Saturday next and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is one of the issues to be discussed.

      <P>The delivery of health services by health boards includes the provision of care for persons with earing disorders, including bulima.  Persons with eating disorders are generally treated in the health board area in which they reside.  Where in-patient treatment is deemed necessary, it is provided in the person's local acute psychiatric unit or hospital.</P>
      <P>In addition, a tertiary referral service with fully trained medical staff for treating persons with eating disorders is available in St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin, St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, County Dublin and in an Eastern Health Board administered service at Warrenstown House, Blanchardstown, Dublin.  The number of persons suffering from eating disorders is not readily available but I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious of the need to prevent eating disorders arising in the first place.  The health promotion unit of my Department is actively involved with the Department of Education and Science in the promotion of healthy nutrition in schools and in programmes which foster self-esteem and positive body awareness, particularly among young girls.  The health promotion unit has also published and distributed widely an information leaflet on the subject of eating disorders.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 42, 55 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>Published death rates from cancer in different countries have to be interpreted with great caution. A number of factors may explain the difference between recorded death rates from breast cancer in the USA and European countries, including Ireland.  These include differences in classification methods, the registration of second cancer tumours and the approach to death certification.</P>
      <P>It is important to take account of age differences when comparing death rates from any disease. The age standardised death rate per 100,000 population in Ireland is 26 for breast cancer.  This is the same figure as in the UK.  In the USA the age standardised figure is 21.  While the US figure is lower, the differences do not appear as pronounced as implied by some statistics quoted in recent media reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently implementing a comprehensive national cancer strategy which is aimed at reducing mortality from the disease, greatly improving treatment services throughout the country, and establishing screening programmes for the earliest possible detection of breast cancer and cervical cancer.  It is hoped to commence screening in <Col N="420" /> phase one of the breast screening programme in September.</P>
    <P>The strategy also contains a plan for reorganising cancer treatment services around supra-regional and regional cancer centres.  Each region will have a high quality cancer service for treatments that can be given locally, with speedy access to appropriate specialist services, including radiotherapy, in the supra-regional centres.  Each centre has a regional director of cancer services who is currently overseeing the reorganisation process and preparing a regional plan for the development of services.</P>
    <P>I am strongly committed to the implementation of the national cancer strategy.  I allocated £7.7 million this year for the purpose, which is in addition to the £6 million spent in 1997.  I allocated a further £1 million for the national breast screening programme this year, on top of the £1 million allocated to the programme in 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the newspaper report to which the Deputy is referring concerning the care of children with severe behavioural problems.  Under the Child Care Act, 1991, health boards have statutory responsibility for promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  A small number of children whom the boards have been endeavouring to assist cannot be appropriately cared for in the existing range of residential care centres.</P>
      <P>Judicial review proceedings were brought against a number of health boards on behalf of some of the children concerned alleging that the boards were failing in their statutory responsibilities towards the children.  The High Court has held that the Child Care Act, 1991 does not empower a health board to detain a child and that the State is under a constitutional duty to provide suitable secure accommodation for children who need to be detained for their own safety and welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1996, which has recently been restored to the Order Paper, amends and extends the Child Care Act, 1991.  Part X of the Bill provides for the making of a special care order on the application of a health board which would commit children requiring special care to the care of a health board and authorise the board to arrange for appropriate care, education <Col N="421" /> and treatment for the child and for this purpose to detain a child in a special care unit.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board proposes to build two special care units in County Dublin and it is envisaged that each unit will accommodate 24 young people.  Planning permission has been received for one of these units and it is hoped to proceed with this unit as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that while occasionally children in care can run away and are missing for a short period, not all of these children need to be accommodated in a secure setting.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 62 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies may be referring to a test known as PSA, or prostate-specific antigen which is increasingly being used for early detection and screening.  Some experts argue that this test, when combined with digital rectal examination, can detect more prostate cancers and at an earlier stage.  However, other experts argue that there is as yet no scientific evidence that such screening reduces deaths from prostate cancer.  Much of the literature in this area notes that absence of controlled studies defining the costs and benefits of prostate screening and a common conclusion is that more research is required to determine its effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Extensive trials on screening for prostate cancer are already under way.  The National Cancer Institute in the USA and the European Cancer Programme are engaging in major studies involving more than 120,000 men to study the potential value of specific screening programmes.  It is hoped that the trials will also provide valuable <Col N="422" /> information about mortality identification of high risk groups and the most appropriate screening intervals, if such screening is proved to be medically effective.</P>
    <P>As in the case of all potential screening initiatives, it is vital that we first satisfy ourselves as to the efficacy of any prostate screening programme. My Department will continue to keep the question of a pilot prostate screening programme under review in light of the available international evidence.</P>

      <P>Three Dublin maternity hospitals, the Coombe, the Rotunda and the National Maternity Hospitals provide public maternity services to people from counties Dublin, Wicklow and Kildare.  In 1996, 92 per cent of mothers who delivered in the three hospitals came from within the designated catchment area, 4 per cent came from Meath, 3 per cent from the rest of Leinster and 1 per cent from elsewhere.  These figures include referrals for tertiary services including neo-natal intensive care.</P>
      <P>A strategic review of maternity services in Dublin has recently been completed by the Dublin maternity hospitals and submitted to my Department.  The report addressed the role of the three hospitals in the organisation and delivery of services in the region and considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the future catchment area which should be served by the Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that for the future the most appropriate and balanced policy should be that the primary catchment area for each hospital would be its own region and that there should be no restriction on serving other regions within available resources.  However patients resident outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority area would not be encouraged, other than for clinical reasons, to avail of the Dublin hospitals.</P>
      <P>The report findings will be the subject of discussions with the three maternity hospitals in the coming weeks.  The programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, gave a commitment to identify regional funding imbalances in the system, particularly in the provision of hospital services.  The provision of maternity services for all women within their own local region is in line with this commitment.</P>

      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in Limerick and the mid-west region is a matter in the first instance for the Mid-Western Health Board.  The Mid-Western Health Board has identified a current requirement for 31 residential and 42 day care places for the region based on figures from the National Intellectual Disability Database.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate funding of £16 million in 1998 for services to persons with a mental handicap to continue the process of delivering the services identified in the Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 which is based on figures from the national intellectual disability database. This funding includes £10.75 million revenue and £5.25 million capital.  The Mid-Western Health Board region received a total of £1.455 million from the additional revenue funding for the improvement of local services.  This includes £0.5 million for the provision of new residential-respite and day care places in 1998.  Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Mid-Western Health Board region and the individuals who will benefit from these services are being agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committee in line with the priority needs which have been identified for the region.  Proposals for the expenditure of this additional funding, as agreed by the regional co-ordinating committee, will shortly be submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>Late last year I also announced a new major capital programme of £30 million which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.  The Mid-Western Health Board region will also benefit from this capital programme, details of which are currently being discussed with the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies.</P>
      <P>As outlined in Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of ENT treatment to eligible persons in south Tipperary is the statutory responsibility of the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  I understand from the board that the person in question is on the waiting list for an out-patient appointment at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel.  The scheduling of appointments is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned and is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Should the person referred to feel her condition warrants more immediate attention she should return to her general practitioner who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of the case to the consultant directly.</P>
      <P>Figures collected by my Department relate to the numbers of people on in-patient hospital waiting lists rather than to the patient's place of residence.  Therefore, it would not be possible to give the Deputy a breakdown of the number of persons from south Tipperary currently on the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The numbers of people in the South Eastern Health Board area awaiting ENT replacements at 30 September 1997, the latest date for which figures are available, are as follows: Ear, Nose and Throat procedures (Adult), 440; Ear, Nose and Throat procedures (Children), 203.</P>

      <P>The current position in relation to the sale of medicinal products containing paracetamol is that only packs containing not more than twenty-five 500mg tablets or equivalent may be sold in non-pharmacy retail outlets.  Quantities above this amount may only be sold in pharmacies and may in certain circumstances require a prescription from a registered medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>Because of concerns over the serious effects arising from overdosages of paracetamol, the Irish Medicines Board recently made a series of recommendations in relation to the sale of paracetamol, including a recommendation to further restrict the sale of paracetamol in non-pharmacy retail outlets to packs containing not more than twelve 500mg tablets or equivalent.</P>

      <P>Design work for this project is due to start this month.  Construction could start in December 1998 in which case the unit could be ready by the end of 1999, assuming no problems arise with planning permission.  The full capital costs of the project will not be required in the current year and funding for the development will be provided as required.  As the building work is programmed to be completed in 1999, a full year's activity of 450 procedures should be achieved in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses.  The illnesses covered by this scheme are: mental handicap, mental illness &mdash; for persons under 16 years <Col N="428" /> only &mdash; phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.  Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 80 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a series of initiatives aimed at reducing hospital waiting lists in areas such as those mentioned by the Deputy.  These include: the allocation so far of £9 million for the waiting list initiative for 1998, with a further £3 million yet to be allocated &mdash; this represents a 50 per cent increase over the funding allocated in 1997; where applicable, individual agencies have been notified in their determination of net expenditure for 1998 of the level of funding available to them for waiting list work.  This will give agencies much earlier notice of the money available than in previous years and will enable them to plan their activity accordingly; each agency's service plan must now specify targets for waiting list activity during the year.  It will then be the responsibility of the chief executive officer-hospital manager to ensure that the targets are achieved and to take corrective action if necessary as the year proceeds; agencies have been instructed to focus increasingly on waiting times as well as on waiting lists, with the objective of ensuring that children do not have to wait longer than six months and adults no longer than 12 months in the specialties targeted for attention; where agencies have not already done so, they have been requested to designate an individual to act as a co-ordinator of waiting list work within the agency and as a contact point with the Department.</P>
      <P>I am confident that taken together, these measures offer the best means of reducing waiting lists and waiting times.  This will be to the benefit of all patients who depend on the services provided in public hospitals.</P>
      <P>The aim of the waiting list initiative is to reduce both waiting lists and waiting times in target specialties.  Most of the specialties involved, such as orthopaedics and ear, nose and throat, do not generally relate to life-threatening conditions. They are primarily directed towards improving quality of life.</P>
      <P>Information relating to persons who have died while awaiting treatment is not collected by my Department.  It should be borne in mind that patients may die from conditions not connected with the treatment for which they are on a waiting list.</P>

      <P>All employees of any category, including outsourced workers, are included under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  The provision of services in hospitals is the responsibility of the hospital, including the implementation of the safety, health and welfare at work legislation. The primary responsibility for implementation of the safety, health and welfare at work legislation, including training and vaccinations, under the Act, is a day to day matter which rests with the employer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of my Department that persons with a mental handicap inappropriately placed in psychiatric hospitals in the past should be relocated. Services to persons with a dual diagnosis of mental handicap and mental illness will continue to be provided for in a psychiatric setting. My Department, in conjunction with the health boards and voluntary organisations, has been engaged in an ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings.  Since 1990 over 380 such persons have been transferred to more appropriate accommodation.</P>
      <P>From 1994 to 1997 £1.26 million capital funding was provided to St. Ita's in order to upgrade existing facilities.  Additional revenue funding of £0.99 million was also provided during this period in order to increase staffing levels, to provide multi-disciplinary support, to enhance services to persons with a mental handicap who are also behaviourally disturbed and to transfer persons to more appropriate accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has submitted its development plan for the mental handicap services in St. Ita's Hospital.  The funding of this plan is under discussion with officials of my Department for inclusion in the four year capital programme which I announced last December.  The development plan provides for the transfer of between 120 and 150 clients to new residential services off-site and the provision of both new and upgraded residential services and day services for between 150 and 180 clients remaining on the St. Ita's campus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the implementation of this plan the process of moving 50 clients from St. Ita's to new residential services was initiated towards the end of last year.  Some 30 of these clients are transferring <Col N="433" /> to new services at the Hawthorn complex in Stillorgan.  These transfers will enable units F, H and K in the hospital to close.  Planning is now under way for the development of a further residential complex at Clonmethan Lodge, Oldtown, County Dublin which will accommodate 30 clients.  When complete, this will allow for the closure of a further unit.</P>
    <P>In the meantime a special maintenance programme has been established for the mental handicap services in the hospital and I have made £250,000 available for this programme in 1998.  I regard the provision of new residential facilities on the St. Ita's campus as a priority in the continued development of the St. Ita's services.</P>
    <P>I recently paid a visit to the hospital to view the facilities and services provided.  I have also met the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the development and the measures required to implement the remaining elements of the board's plan for the overall development of the campus.  Following my visit to the hospital, the management agreed to submit proposals to me in respect of the most urgent needs for the development of the mental health facilities.  These proposals were subsequently submitted to my Department and I have recently approved a capital grant of £550,000 for the upgrading of the Admission-Assessment Unit at St. Ita's Hospital.</P>

      <P>My Department published an Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001 in 1997 based on information from the national intellectual disability database.  The assessment identified a requirement for 1,439 new residential-respite places and 1,036 new day places over the period in question. As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services for persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in that assessment.</P>
      <P>I met representatives the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland, NAMHI, on 21 October 1997 to discuss its pre-budget submission on projected service requirements. The projected figures quoted by NAMHI in its submission were taken from the assessment of need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities &mdash; Towards and Independent <Col N="434" /> Future &mdash; published in December 1996, recommended that there was an immediate need to provide an additional 100 residential places for people with disabilities, 200 places for persons with long-term disabilities requiring constant nursing care and 200 dedicated respite places.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the proper planning and development of services in this area, the report recommended the establishment of co-ordinating committees in each health board and the establishment of a database on health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities. The future development of residential-respite places will be carried out in consultation with these local co-ordinating committees.  Such committees are being established in each health board.  A pilot project on the database, involving three health boards, has recently been completed. Following the receipt and consideration of the report on this pilot project, the database development committee recommended in the review group will be established.</P>
    <P>I have no knowledge of the projections of the number of residential-respite places required by people with physical and sensory disabilities as prepared by carers or carers' associations.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £16 million in 1998 for services for persons with a mental handicap to continue the process of delivering the services identified in an Assessment of Need for Services for persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.  This includes capital funding of £5.25 million to start the major £30 million capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need.  A total of £8.4 million has been provided in 1998 for services for persons with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of this, £3 million has been allocated for the development of services.  Priorities for the allocation of this will be decided by the health boards in consultation with the local co-ordinating committees.</P>

      <P>The health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, sets out the national strategy for the development of the health services.  Since the publication of the health strategy, the Department of Health and Children, with its partners in the delivery of health care, has been pursuing that vision of the health service.  Further policy documents have been produced which deal in greater detail with aspects of the implementation of the strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steady progress has been made in the implementation of the four year action plan which accompanied the strategy.  A wide-ranging review of the plan is under way in the Department and 1998 will see the commencement of work on a new strategy for the first decade of the next century. <Col N="435" /> Given the extent of consultation which will take place in the preparation of this strategy, and the range of policy documents published on various aspects of the health services in recent years, I do not propose to publish a Green Paper on the services in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are in place in all health boards to address the problems arising from year 2000 compliance.  Virtually all boards have formal steering committees in place to oversee the necessary remedial action.  In the boards that have not, the work is overseen by senior management. Each health agency is addressing the problem from its own perspective and in the way that best suits its own circumstances.  Typically, the information technology is being addressed by the management services units while the embedded systems aspect is being addressed by the technical staff &mdash; either technical service officers, engineering or medical physics staff, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is too early to say with certainty when all systems will be compliant.  Health agencies are approaching the issue from a business continuity perspective and will be ensuring that systems which pose a threat to public health are addressed on a priority basis.  Senior managers are fully aware of the problem and will be working towards compliance for all business critical systems well in advance of the due dates.  Health agencies will be expected to be year 2000 compliant well in advance of the new millennium.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for ensuring the adequacy of general practitioner services for medical card patients is with the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.  Overall, the number of general practitioners participating in the GMS at the end of 1997 was 1,646 compared to a figure of 1,538 a decade ago.  This increase has brought the mean GMS panel size down to 741 at the end of last year and this panel average compares very favourably with the limit of 2,000 provided for in the GMS contract for provision of general practitioner services.</P>
      <P>The comprehensive national general practice survey carried out in 1997 by the Irish College of General Practitioners found that the average general practice consultation time is ten minutes which compares favourably with both British and European figures and indicates a commitment to patient care and quality service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the report on the Methadone Treatment Services Review Group was published on 19 January 1998 and circulated nationwide to each general practitioner and pharmacist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report's recommendations include the following: the continuation of the central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone &mdash; under this arrangement a general practitioner who is considering prescribing methadone for a patient can check whether the patient's name is <Col N="438" /> on this treatment list and so minimise the possibility that the patient concerned is receiving methadone from more than one source; the provision of a personalised treatment card to each patient &mdash; this card is, in turn, presented to a local pharmacist who holds it for the duration of treatment; support to general practitioners and pharmacists through the appointment of a general practitioner facilitator, including close liaison and communication arrangements with health board services in the event of a patient destabilising; contractual arrangements with general practitioners, pharmacists, etc.; the provision for supervised administration of methadone in cases where a general practitioner feels the need for this; the introduction of regulations to require that the prescription and supply of methadone be restricted to official prescription forms specifically designed for the purpose; specific training and information for general practitioners and pharmacists on the treatment of opiate dependent persons; and methadone monitoring to be placed on a statutory basis by regulation under the Misuse of Drugs Act.</P>
    <P>A committee, comprised of representatives from the Eastern Health Board, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the Department of Health and Children, is working on implementing the recommendations contained in the report.  The committee meets on a regular basis to work on the arrangements to allow for the smooth implementation of all the recommendations.  The committee is considering the timescale for implementation of the recommendations and I have requested my Department's officials who are on the committee and working in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board to provide details of the time schedule to me as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>The committee's main objective will be to ensure that all general practitioners and pharmacists providing methadone treatment do so in accordance with the arrangements in the report. I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations in the group's report will result in strict control of the prescribing and dispensing of methadone in the treatment of opiate misuse.</P>

      <P>My Department is committed to increasing the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland and has set in place a number of initiatives to achieve this goal.  Following the launch of A National Breastfeeding Policy for Ireland a departmental working <Col N="439" /> group was established.  This group has been liaising with the health boards with a view to encourging the development of appropriate structures to promote breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>The support of health professionals is recognised as critical to the success of the national breastfeeding policy as they are the first point of contact with the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and the training of professionals was identified in the breastfeeding policy as a priority area for attention.  The health promotion unit of my Department provided funding towards the production of a training pack for health professionals which was developed in conjunction with the Centre for Health Promotion Studies, University College, Galway and An Bord Altranais.  The pack, which was launched in January this year, consists of a video and information booklet designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers with breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit has also assisted the North-Western Board in the production of the Breast Fed is Best Fed booklet and poster which contains clear and simple advice on the benefits of breastfeeding.  These booklets have been made available nationally.  In addition, my Department supports the work of many of the voluntary organisations involved in this area which enables them to continue their valuable work in encouraging breastfeeding.</P>
      <P>With regard to a national target for breastfeeding, an overall breastfeeding initiation rate of 50 per cent by the year 2000 was set in A National Breastfeeding Policy for Ireland.  The latest available national statistics on breastfeeding are contained in the recently released perinatal statistics report, 1993 which indicates that the percentage of mothers breastfeeding was about 34 per cent in that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 75 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Where circumstances permit, an adoption agency will do what it can to facilitate contact between adopted persons and birth relatives by mutual voluntary consent provided it is satisfied, through counselling, that both parties are fully cognisant of the considerations and implications involved in such a step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have previously explained to the House, the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for post-adoption contact between birth mothers and adopted persons and access to birth records is a priority.  However, it would not be prudent to proceed with the necessary <Col N="441" /> enabling legislation at present as there are a number of legal and constitutional issues awaiting clarification following the hearing of a Supreme Court case in July 1997.  Judgment in this case was reserved and is still awaited.</P>
    <P>The adopted children register contains no identifying information as to a child's origins.  Any measure to enable adopted persons to gain access to their original birth records would require amendment of section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952 which restricts such access.  Such an amendment would require primary legislation and therefore is not a matter that can be addressed through the making of new adoption rules under section 5 of the Adoption Act, 1952 which is, I presume, the approach that Deputy Shortall is suggesting.  The power to make new adoption rules under section 5 is vested in the Adoption Board.  I do not have the power to initiate such rules.  I consider that any amendment to section 22 should be made in the context of the overall legal framework for post-adoption contact.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board treats the records of children of international origin subject to an Irish adoption order in the same manner as Irish children subject to such an order and the statutory framework set out in section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952 applies equally in both cases.  The vast majority of foreign children are adopted under the law of their country of origin and their adoptions are then recorded by the registrar of the Adoption Board in the register of foreign adoptions. A copy of the relevant entry in the register is available to the child and his or her parents as it satisfies any legal requirement for the production of a birth certificate.  Information on a child's origins as supplied by the child's adoptive parents in consideration of their application for an entry in the register of foreign adoptions is maintained by the Adoption Board.  All other information in relation to the child's origins is maintained by the regulatory authorities in the child's place of origin and by the child's adoptive parents.</P>

      <P>The two principal causes of premature illness and death in Ireland were identified in the national health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, as cancer and cardio-vascular disease.  While these conditions can affect men an women differently, my Department's approach to highlighting the importance of disease prevention through lifestyle change and early diagnosis and treatment has tended in general not to differentiate on the basis of gender.</P>
      <P>The plan for women's health, however, recognised that the incidence of breast and cervical cancer could be reduced with the introduction of screening programmes which target women in certain categories.  A breast screening programme is in preparation and it is proposed that screening shall begin in September of this year.  The Mid-Western Health Board is the pilot region for the national cervical screening programme and work to develop this initiative is currently in progress. I will be keeping both of these programmes under review.  The National Cancer Strategy, published in November 1996, is aimed at reducing premature mortality among both males and females by 15 per cent in the ten year period, 1994-2004.</P>
      <P>My Department's proposals for a national strategy for cardiovascular health which was announced recently, are aimed at addressing the wider issues surrounding disease prevention and treatment.  The key objective is to reduce the unacceptable toll of mortality and morbidity associated with the disease and to provide a prompt, comprehensive and high quality service for public patients.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 94 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>On taking up office, I gave a personal commitment to review the recommendations of the cardiac surgery option appraisal group, CSOAG, which had reported under the previous Government. The CSOAG had examined four potential hospital sites, including University College Hospital, Galway, and invited them to make costed submissions in support of providing 500 additional cardiac procedures nationally.  Arising from this a decision had been taken to site the additional cardiac surgery capacity at St. James's Hospital, Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my review of the CSOAG recommendations, I announced a major new initiative on cardiovascular health and cardiac services on 29 January last aimed at achieving an integrated approach to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.  Under the comprehensive package of measures involved, cardiac surgery facilities will be provided at University College Hospital, Galway in the next phase of the major redevelopment programme currently under way there.  Phase one of this programme is currently under construction and a development control plan is now being finalised for the remainder of the redevelopment programme.  I expect to receive the final development control plan for <Col N="444" /> approval in the next month and I will be in a position to make a more detailed statement on the anticipated timescale for completion of the developments planned at that stage.  Provision for the capital costs associated with the new cardiac surgery unit will be made in my Department's current capital programme for 1998-2000.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is taken from the 1996 census and is as follows: 65-74 = 239,351; 75-84 = 139,868; 85-94 = 32,885; 95+ = 1,778.</P>
      <P>Policy on the development of services for older people is based on the report, The Years Ahead which was published in 1988.  The report recommended that older people be maintained in dignity and independence at home with the support of the community care services where necessary and when this is no longer possible, that they have access to the best possible medical or long-term care.</P>
      <P>I am continuing with the development of sevices for older people along the lines recommended in The Years Ahead report taking into account the recent review of the implementation of the recommendations of this report carried out by the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  Additional resources have been made available both in 1997 and 1998 to provide new services for older people or to improve existing services such as specialist departments of medicine of old age attached to general hospitals, community nursing units which provide a wide range of services for older people including respite and day care, day hospitals and day centres, together with better staffing in existing extended care hospitals and in the community services in order to improve support for older people in their homes.  Resources have also been provided this year to develop a specialist mental health service for older people, particularly in a number of health board areas where no such service existed up to now.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People has identified the need to develop better community support services for older people and I intend to give priority to the enhancement of these services as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EC) 258/97 came into effect in all member states of the European Union in mid-May 1997 and the Department of Health and Children is the competent authority for its implementation in Ireland.  The regulation applies to the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients. Food and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree within the European Community and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia</i>, within its scope.  This would include food and food ingredients which are intended for use as human food, have not been used heretofore, and which are derived from the genetic modification of plants.</P>
      <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved-authorised before being placed on the European market.  The regulation also contains provisions for the labelling of novel food and food ingredients.  My Department is considering the specific requirements of the implementation of the regulation in Ireland and recently asked the Food Safety Authority of Ireland for its advice on the matter.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has responsibility for the wider issue of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.  Authorisations for research and development related to genetic modification, including that of plants, are made under this legislation. I am aware that his Department is preparing a national position paper on the issue of genetic modification.  My Department will be happy to contribute to the food related aspects of this exercise and indeed preliminary discussions have already taken place.</P>

      <P>Promoting a smoke free society is a priority for myself and my Department.  I am currently conducting a fundamental review on smoking and health policy and when this is completed I will bring forward proposals for further measures to protect children.</P>
      <P>With regard to prosecutions for sale of tobacco products to under age persons under the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act, 1988, one prosecution took place in the five years from 1993 to 1997.  I will be looking in particular at the area of enforcement in the review on smoking and health that is under way.  Given the reported prevalence of smoking among school children this is clearly an unsatisfactory record.  The retail organisations are aware of the prohibition on sale of cigarettes to minors and campaigns to highlight this area have been carried out by my Department in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement in relation to two recent recalls of certain blood products by the BTSB.  In relation to the first recall of products, the BTSB became aware in December 1997, on foot of a new question included in the donor questionnaire, that a donor had undergone neurosurgery in a Dublin hospital in 1983.  Following further investigation as to the nature of the neurosurgery, the BTSB confirmed with the consultant concerned on 3 February 1998 that the donor had received a human dura mater graft.  While the donor in question is well and while there is no proven or even probable instance of transmission of CJD by blood, blood components or blood products anywhere in the world, there is international evidence that a very small proportion of recipients of human dura mater grafts may contract classical CJD from such grafts.  The BTSB informed my Department of the situation on 4 February 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BTSB immediately initiated procedures to trace previous donations given by the donor to <Col N="451" /> determine whether any products derived from his donations were still available.  This involved an examination of BTSB records and liaison with the pharmaceutical company to which his donations had been sent for processing.  It emerged that the donations had been used in the manufacture of specific batches of Factor 8 and Factor 9, which are clotting factor concentrates used to treat people with haemophilia.  The BTSB informed the Irish Haemophilia Society of the situation on 10 February 1998, as soon as details of the batches concerned were received from the pharmaceutical company, in order to co-ordinate the process of informing persons with haemophilia about the recall and the reasons for it.  The BTSB also had consultations with the Director of the National Haemophilia Centre.  Some of the batches in question had been distributed for self-administration by haemophiliacs in their homes. These batches were withdrawn and replacement products supplied.  The Irish Haemophilia Society contacted its members by phone and post in order to address any concerns that they may have had and arranged for an expert on CJD to address a special meeting for members.  I would like to take this opportunity of acknowledging the significant efforts of the society in this regard.  A recall and replacement procedure was also undertaken in relation to products supplied to hospitals.</P>
    <P>The second recall initiated by the BTSB involved two batches of albumin.  Albumin is a blood product sometimes used when patients are undergoing surgery, or following significant blood loss.  The BTSB became aware in January 1998 that a donor had undergone neurosurgery in 1991.  Following further investigation, the BTSB confirmed on 23 February that the donor had received a human dura mater graft.  My Department was notified by the BTSB of the situation on 24 February 1998.  Following confirmation from the pharmaceutical company that albumin derived from previous donations given by the donor was still in circulation, the BTSB initiated an immediate withdrawal of any in-date product.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the action taken by the BTSB in both instances was purely precautionary in the face of a theoretical rather than an actual risk.  Both donors are well and there is no evidence that either donor has contracted CJD.  The risk that any of their donations may have transmitted CJD is extremely remote.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the negligible level of risk, the BTSB decided to withdraw any remaining stocks of product derived from the donations of these particular donors.  In doing so, the BTSB went beyond the requirements of the relevant EU regulatory agency, the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products.  The CPMP position is that no recall need be undertaken where a blood authority becomes aware that a donor who has previously donated blood is in a risk category for classical CJD.  On the other hand, the Food and Drugs Administration in the United States requires that a recall of in-date stocks be undertaken, <Col N="452" /> even though there is only a theoretical risk. In adopting the latter approach, the BTSB is pursuing its stated policy of an abundance of caution in respect of any theoretical risk of the transmission of classical CJD through blood transfusion. The Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that the BTSB, in applying such a policy in practice, is required to withdraw products as appropriate circumstances arise.</P>

      <P>A programme of anonymous unlinked testing for HIV, as recommended by the surveillance sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee has been carried out in maternity hospitals and units throughout the country since 1992. Results for the four year period from 1992 to 1996 from this programme show that of the total of 222,687 tests which were carried out, 37 were confirmed HIV positive, giving a rate of 0.017 per cent or 1 in 6,019.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of recent advancements in the effectiveness of drug therapies for the treatment of HIV/AIDS and in the resulting improvement in health outcomes for both mothers and babies, the National AIDS Strategy Committee and its sub-committees have been examining the issue of routine ante-natal testing for HIV in pregnant women.  At the meeting of the National AIDS Strategy Committee yesterday, chaired by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, recommendations were received from the surveillance subcommittee, the care and management sub-committee <Col N="453" /> and the regional AIDS co-ordinators that a programme of routine ante-natal testing should commence.  This was agreed by the main committee and it was recommended that a group be established without delay to effect a programme of testing at the earliest date, giving due consideration to providing pregnant women with information and advice on the benefits of such testing.</P>

      <P>The study to which the Deputy refers will be published shortly.  It is at present with the printers and I expect that the first copies will be available during next week.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 2 December 1997 the Government decided to establish a Cabinet committee to oversee the work of an interdepartmental working group whose task it will be to prepare a Green Paper on abortion.  This work is under way at present.  Submissions from interested parties and from the public generally have been invited and it will be the objective to have the Green Paper completed in the summer.</P>
      <P>The draft report submitted to my Department by the Trinity research team in December 1997 contained a number of policy recommendations made in the light of their findings.  I am of the view that it would not be appropriate to publish an important report containing recommendations, while a consultation process leading to the preparation of the Green Paper is under way.  To do so could lead to the Government being accused of attempting to influence the debate or of endorsing certain positions on the abortion issue in advance of the preparation of the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>The Trinity College research team, with whom the Department has discussed the matter is of the view that the publication of recommendations could deflect the debate away from the research findings, which are of themselves of paramount importance.  My Department has suggested to the team that they consider making a submission to the working group which is preparing the Green Paper on abortion.  The final version of the study contains detailed findings and conclusions based on the team's research.  Arrangements for its printing and publication are, as I have indicated, in-train at present and the study will be placed on public sale as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, provides that all passenger boats carrying 12 or fewer passengers must be inspected and licensed by my Department.  A passenger boat licence may only be granted after the vessel has been inspected by a marine surveyor of my Department and found to be suitable.  The operators of all such vessels, must, for licensing purposes, satisfy a comprehensive range of safety standards in relation to vessel construction and seaworthiness, and approved firefighting, life-saving and radio equipment.</P>
      <P>While the majority of passenger boat licences issued by my Department are valid for the summer period only, that is, 1 April to 31 October each year, there are a number of vessels whose licence allows them to operate in the winter time as well.  In any event, the licence clearly stipulates that such vessels may operate in fine and fair weather only.  The passenger boat licence also specifies the limits beyond which the boat may not ply and the maximum number of passengers that may be carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before a passenger boat licence is issued, the Marine Survey Office must be satisified as to the knowledge and ability of a designated person or <Col N="455" /> persons in relation to the operation of the vessel, familiarity with the area of operation, emergency procedures, and the use of firefighting and safety equipment.  Only persons actually named on the licence are permitted to act as skipper of the vessel when carrying passengers.</P>
    <P>The Garda has been notified of the precise provisions of the 1992 Act and any suspected breaches of these provisions are brought to the notice of the local Garda Síochána who are responsible for law enforcement in general.  Apart from the statutory surveys, individual passenger boats are monitored by my Department, as well as the Garda, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the vessel is being operated in compliance with the legislation.  Operators who are found to be in breach of the terms of their licence are liable to be prosecuted and can face fines, or even imprisonment, if convicted.</P>

      <P>The Government have repeatedly raised our deep humanitarian concern about the situation of this person and her baby with the British Government. The Taoiseach raised the matter directly with Prime Minister Mr. Blair when they met on 26 February 1998.</P>
      <P>I have continued to pursue our concerns with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and, through the London Embassy, with the responsible British authorities.  As I indicated to the House in reply to Questions Nos. 9 and 15 of 11 December 1997, I have also spoken to the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, about this person's situation and received a reply from him recognising the humanitarian dimension to the case.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also been in contact with the British Home Secretary in the matter.</P>
      <P>On my instructions also, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the London Embassy have been monitoring this person's health and circumstances very closely.  An Embassy official most recently visited her in hospital on 16 February 1998.  In the aftermath of this visit, I remain very seriously concerned about her health and have again conveyed my deep anxiety to the British authorities.  I also spoke to her legal representative yesterday and to her mother today, with both of whom I had a detailed meeting in Dublin some time ago.</P>
      <P>I understand that the British Home Secretary may shortly be making a decision on the application for extradition of this person.  In arriving at his decision, my firm hope is that the Home Secreary will take fully into account the extremely strong humanitarian dimension of this case.  I will be staying in the closest contact with all aspects of the case in the period immediately ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Groundwater protection schemes constitute reports with maps which are prepared for local authorities by the geological survey of Ireland (GSI) of my Department.  The scheme for County Wicklow will be completed shortly and a <Col N="459" /> draft will then be sent to Wicklow County Council for review.</P>
      <P>The Meath scheme has been available in draft form for about a year and a half.  GSI recently received the Council's comments on the report and is working on a revised version.  Copies of the draft report and maps can be consulted in the GSI.</P>
      <P>In 1979 a scheme was drawn up for County Dublin.  This was the first such scheme prepared by GSI.  The scheme predates the generic scheme currently used by GSI and endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Environment and Local Government; it does not use the most recent geological mapping.  It is, therefore, out of date in several ways.  It is available for consultation in GSI.  GSI has not been approached by Fingal County Council to produce a scheme and, therefore, has no plans to do so.</P>
      <P>Groundwater protection schemes contain a number of coloured maps which are printed individually. The maps are available for consultation by customers at a cost of £5 per sheet.  The cost of supplying each map is £25.  The suite of maps for the Meath scheme contains 14 sheets.  Separate charges apply for supplying copies of reports and the provision of advisory services.  Arrangements for consultation or the supply of maps can be made with the Groundwater Section in GSI at Beggars Bush, Haddington Road, Dublin 4, telephone 6041487/8, fax 6681782.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as a provision of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, section 941 is not new legislation but the re-enactment in consolidated form of existing legislation. Section 941 was formerly enacted as section 429 <Col N="461" /> of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the provision has been part of tax legislation for many years.  In applying section 941 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, to current decisions of the Appeal Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners are therefore merely applying existing legislation reenacted as part of the consolidation of the direct tax code to such decisions.</P>

      <P>Regulation (EC) 258/97 came into effect in all member states of the European Union in mid-May 1997 and the Department of Health and Children is the competent authority for its implementation in Ireland.  The regulation applies to the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients. Food and food ingredients which have not hitherto been used for human consumption to a significant degree with the European Union and which contain or are produced from a genetically modified organism fall, <i>inter alia,</i> within its scope.</P>
      <P>Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients, if not substantially equivalent to their non-novel counterparts, must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved and authorised before being placed on the European market.  Since it came into force, no product containing or derived from a genetically modified organism has undergone this safety assessment process.  However under the regulation certain cetegories of novel foods, including, <i>inter alia,</i> foods derived from but not containing genetically modified organisms, may be placed on the market without this formal safety approval if the food can be shown to be substantially equivalent to its non-novel counter-part as regards its composition, nutritional value, metabolism, intended use and its content of undesirable substances.  I am informed by the European Commission that, following a scientific assessment, the competent authorities in the United Kingdom have deemed the six products listed in the following table to be substantially equivalent and the producers have notified the Commission of their intentions to place these products on the market.  I understand that three of these products may already be on the European market.  The notifications received on 10 December 1997 are in respect of food and food ingredients produced from crops to be harvested in autumn 1998.</P>

      <P>The virus reference laboratory has indicated that the number of new cases of hepatitis B identified by the laboratory in 1997 was 159.  The corresponding figure for 1996 was 110 cases.</P>
      <P>Future vaccination strategy against hepatitis B is among the issues which my Department's chief medical officer has asked the Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland to consider in the course of its review of the existing guidelines.  I have arranged for the information provided by the virus reference laboratory to be brought to the committee's attention through my Department's representative on the committee.</P>

      <P>The work relating to year 2000 compliance within my Department is being carried out by staff in the corporate services division.  This work began in early 1997 when all computer systems were <Col N="465" /> assessed for their year 2000 compliance.  This assessment was carried out by examining all internally developed systems, including operating systems, licensed software, database management systems, application development software, groupware software and personal productivity software.  In addition, an inventory of all file servers, personal computers and communication equipment was developed.</P>
      <P>To date it has been established that most of the internally developed systems are compliant but some older systems will require modification. Some systems have been identified which will be replaced.  Hardware has also been identified which is not compliant but will be replaced or retired as obsolete before year 2000.  This will also apply to office equipment such as fax and photocopiers. Packaged software and personal productivity software which allow users to create small databases and spreadsheet applications will require further testing before compliance is achieved.  It is intended to test all applications for compliance during the second and third quarters of 1998.</P>

      <P>The Births and Deaths Registration Acts, 1863 to 1996, include provisions for the entry of paternity details in the register of births in respect of children born to parents not married to each other. As the Deputy may be aware, the Status of Children Act, 1987, amended section 7 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Ireland), 1880, by the substitution of sections 7 and 7A. These sections set out the procedures allowing for the registration of paternity details in such cases and included a provision for the registration of the father's details in the register of births on the joint application for registration by the parents or on the application by one or other parents with co-operation of the other parent.  They also provided for the registration of paternity details on the sole application of either the father or the mother of the child on the production of a certified copy of a court order naming the father of the child.</P>

      <P>Over the past couple of years my Department has <Col N="467" /> made additional funding available to the hospital under the waiting list initiative for the provision of ENT services.  In addition, a number of recent measures have been taken by my Department and the hospital which are aimed at reducing ENT waiting lists.</P>
      <P>First, my Department recently approved the provision of a new 20 bed day ward for the hospital and it is envisaged that this will increase the number of day beds in the hospital and also free up space for more surgical beds.</P>
      <P>Second, my Department approved the appointment of a consultant anaesthetist for the hospital which should facilitate an increase in theatre times for ENT procedures.  In line with this, I understand that the hospital has under consideration proposals to make additional theatre time available during 1998 within the context of its 1998 service plan.</P>

      <P>The vast majority of the membership of the Medical Council is elected by the constituent elements of the medical profession.  The Minister for Health and Children appoints four members of the council to represent the public interest.  The Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, stipulates that three of those must be drawn from outside the medical profession.  Therefore, the scope for the Minister ensuring that any particular branch or element of the profession is represented on the council is limited.  The primary function of the Medical Council is to protect the public from unqualified or incompetent doctors.  The council investigates all appropriate complaints made to it, including complaints by one medical practitioner against another.  I am confident that the council would diligently investigate complaints of racism or other forms of unprofessional conduct made to it.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health and Children and the <Col N="469" /> statutory agencies under its aegis do not routinely collect information on the country of origin of doctors working in the Irish health services. Doctors from EU member states are automatically entitled to be registered as medical practitioners and to practice here.  However, the fact of being registered with the Medical Council does not necessarily mean that a doctor is actually working in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The only group of doctors on whom such information is collected are non-consultant hospital doctors.  In a survey conducted by the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board on 1 October 1996 there were 986 non-EU nationals employed as NCHDs in the public health service.  This figure constitutes 38 per cent of all NCHD posts.  On 1 October 1988 there were 418 non-EU nationals in NCHD posts accounting for 23 per cent of all such posts.</P>

    <P>*All figures are provisional based on year of registration.</P>
    <P>Source: Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>With respect to cancer incidence, age-standardised data by area of residence and type of neoplasm have recently become available in the first <Col N="471" /> annual report of the National Cancer Registry. The report refers to 1994 which is the first year for which full registration of all cancers in the country was undertaken.  Prior to 1994, the southern tumour registry collected and published population based incidence data relating to Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>The report of the National Cancer Registry shows considerable variation in incidence rates for different regions depending on the type of cancer.  When several years' data are available, it will then be possible to construct and interpret time trends in cancer incidence.  The report provides data by county and shows that the highest overall incidence of cancer occurs in County Dublin.  My Department has asked the National Cancer Registry to forward a copy of its report to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>For other illnesses, with the exception of acute infectious diseases, many of which are notifiable, incidence data are not generally available.  Heart conditions, unlike cancer, are not subject to or readily amenable to registration.  For conditions requiring hospitalisation, statistics on acute hospital discharges are available through the hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE, system.  For a number of reasons, including the fact that data on private hospitals are not captured, the HIPE system is of limited use in examining regional variation in prevalence of heart disease.</P>
    <P>Statistics on mortality are often used as a proxy for incidence data, and, as stated above, these are available in the annual and quarterly reports on vital statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office.  Age standardised mortality rates for various forms of heart disease are contained in the public health information system which is a computerised common data set on health indicators compiled by my Department.  This shows declining rates of mortality from heart disease in all parts of the country during the past 15 years. There is also some evidence to suggest that mortality rates from diseases of the heart and circulatory system are lowest in the south and highest in the north of the country.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am now establishing an expert group to develop a strategic approach to the reduction of premature death and illness caused by cardiovascular disease.  The strategy is expected to cover preventive medical, surgical and rehabilitation services, health promotion and education initiatives to tackle risk factors, organisation and evaluation of services and ongoing research into the causes and treatments of cardiovascular disease.  The development of a national strategy on cardiovascular health will be central to the achievement of the medium term target of the health strategy, which is to reduce the death rate from cardiovascular disease in the under 65 age group by 30 per cent by the year 2005.  The National Cancer Strategy, which is currently being implemented throughout the country, aims to help reduce deaths from cancer <Col N="472" /> in the under 65 age group by 15 per cent in the period 1994-2004.</P>

      <P>The orthodontic services in the Western Health Board are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present reviewing the role of the Dublin Dental Hospital in the provisions of training in orthodontics for health board staff. Senior officials in my Department have also arranged a meeting with representatives of the Irish consultants orthodontic group and I have asked them to report back to me.</P>
      <P>The orthodontic review group set up by the chief executive officers of the health boards at the suggestion of my Department has also examined issues in relation to training in orthodontics.  This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the academic and training programmes of both dental schools in orthodontics and other disciplines adequately reflect current and future needs of the public dental service under the health strategy and the dental health action plan.  Following the developments which I have outlined I will, as necessary, consult my colleague the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>My Department is approved for European Regional Development Fund funding under the capital programme for vocational training centres as part of the Human Resources Operational Programme 1994-99.  The operational programme is managed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

      <P>This capital programme provides for an allocation of £33.58 million for vocational training centres for the period 1994-99 of which European Regional Development Fund funding accounts for £18.2 million.  Funding under the capital programme is provided for the provision of new replacement training centres and associated support facilities; the upgrading of existing training workshops and support facilities resulting in improved workshop standards and the purchase of new and replacement items of equipment.  It is open to all agencies in receipt of European Social Fund funding for the training of people with disabilities under the operational programme to apply for funding from this capital programme.</P>
      <P>Each health board established a co-ordinating committee, representative of all training agencies in their area and the National Rehabiliation Board to agree the distribution of the board's allocation from this capital programme, based on the immediate priorities for capital developments in the vocational training field.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>The present position, in which only one organisation stands designated as an issuing authority for international driving permits has operated since 1992 and arose from the virtual cessation of licence applications to a second formerly designated organisation.  My Department has recently received a request from a different organisation to be designated as an issuing authority for international driving permits.  This request will be determined shortly.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in designating an issuing authority for international driving permits, is not an undertaking within the meaning of the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996. The fee of £4 for an international driving permit is fixed by the relevant statutory instrument and may not be varied by designated licensing authorities.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the unprecedented increase in traffic congestion in Dublin and Cork is causing a serious increase in harmful emissions; the measures, if any, he will take to develop an air quality strategy for urban areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a significant growth in road traffic volumes in Ireland in recent years and this is giving rise to increases in journey times in peak urban conditions.  While this has obvious implications for urban air quality, monitoring data show that overall air quality is generally good and all mandatory national and EU ambient standards, including in Dublin and Cork, continue to be met.</P>
      <P>Monitoring of pollutants not currently the subject of air quality standards is being developed in prospect of new EU requirements, at present being considered under Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management and a proposed subsidiary directive relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air. Preliminary work by the Environmental Protection Agency shows a potential problem in relation to PM 10 and this must be factored into updated national and local strategies to prevent and reduce air pollution.</P>
      <P>Air quality management planning is a local authority function under the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and I understand the preparation of a comprehensive air quality management plan for the greater Dublin area is being co-ordinated by Dublin Corporation and is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>Traffic management strategies for the major urban areas, including Dublin and Cork, have regard to environmental factors.  Major road improvements for these areas are also designed to bring benefits in terms of environmental quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the operation of the community employment scheme lies with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In so far as the specific issue raised by the Deputy is concerned, however, the position is as follows.  The introduction of class A PRSI for community employment &mdash; CE &mdash; workers, provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, was designed to enhance the PRSI status of CE workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers. The social welfare secondary benefits of butter vouchers, free fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus, are payable only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments.  Since former CE workers who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit after their period of CE finishes are in receipt of a short-term payment, they are accordingly ineligible for the social welfare secondary benefits.</P>
      <P>While I fully recognise the difficulties facing those former CE workers who no longer have entitlement to certain secondary benefits, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry a high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following table.</P>
      <P>There are currently three different rates of child dependant allowance payable to social welfare recipients.  It will be seen from the table that there have been no increases in the level of child dependant allowances since 1994.  Policy direction in relation to child income support in recent years has focused on targeting resources towards the provision of substantial increases in child benefit. This approach, which centres on making child income support more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parent, has the effect of reducing work disincentives.  This issue has been highlighted in various reports, notably the Final Report of the Expert Working Group on Integrating Tax and Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child benefit has increased substantially from rates of £15.80 per month for the first four children <Col N="481" /> and £22.90 per month for fifth and subsequent children in 1990, to £31.50 for each of the first two children and £42 for each subsequent child from September 1998.  Priority has also been given to utilising family income supplement &mdash; FIS &mdash; as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  In line with <Col N="482" /> a commitment made in the Partnership 2000 Agreement, FIS will be reformed to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages as at present, with effect from October of this year.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.</P>

      <P>I indicated in my previous reply that a list of all grants made in 1997 to community and voluntary organisations by the Department was being compiled.  The list has now been submitted to the Dáil Library for the information of Members.  The list provides a breakdown of grants on a regional basis including the southern region.</P>
      <P>My Department makes grants to a large number of community and voluntary groups each year.  In 1997 some 1,921 individual grants were made.  In view of this large number of individual grants, it has been the practice for a number of years to provide this comprehensive list on an annual basis, by region only and I intend to continue this practice.</P>

      <P>Details on the total value of payments under the supplementary welfare allowance rent and mortgage supplement schemes for the years 1996 and 1997 are shown in the following tabular statement.  Estimates for 1998 are also shown.  In 1996, 76,634 people received rent supplements and 15,658 received mortgage interest supplements.  It is estimated that a similar number of people received those supplements in 1997 and no significant change is expected in 1998.  Despite this, expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially.  This has been mainly driven by increases in rent levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1994, following concern caused by the escalating costs in relation to rent and mortgage interest supplements a review group was established by Government to report to the Minister for Social Welfare on the role of SWA in relation <Col N="483" /> to housing.  The group was comprised of representatives of the Departments of Social Welfare, Health, the Environment and Finance, health boards and local authorities.  The group presented its findings in December 1995.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the Housing Review Group report, an interdepartmental committee was established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Govenment, with representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and Finance, to examine the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to local authorities.  It is understood that the committee will report shortly.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that works at the church referred to are currently being undertaken by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department.  A sum of £200,000, not £300,000 as mention in the question, has been provided for the works under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99. Restoration of the church roof is complete and the internal walls and structures are at present being prepared for renovation.  An archaeological excavation will shortly begin in order to facilitate the provision of service trenches in the graveyard. Conservation of the tombs, which will be permanently housed and displayed in the church, will begin next month.  Later, the installation of guide facilities in the vestry and the provision of exhibition panels will be undertaken.  It is then intended to renew the floors and stairs in the tower.  It is expected that the church will be open to the public during the summer of 1999.</P>

      <P>Lough Arrow in County Sligo is not a proposed designated special area of conservation but is a designated special protection area &mdash; SPA &mdash; under Council Directive (79/409/EEC) on the conservation of wild birds. As a SPA, Lough Arrow receives protection under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 94 of 1997) which transposed the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) into Irish law.  However, hunting is not considered incompatible with the conservation status of SPAs, including Lough Arrow, and there are no plans to regulate hunting on any sites under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.  Under section 30 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, permission may be granted to, <i>inter alia</i>, hunt fauna on or over foreshore belonging to the State and such permissions are granted in respect of Lough Arrow.  Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, is not aware of any conservation reason why hunting should be restricted at Lough Arrow but if detailed information of hunting abuse is made available to me, I will be happy to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <Col N="485" /> I assume that the Deputy is referring in his question to the passenger ferry services between Inishboffin, Clare Island, Inishturk and the mainland for which tenders were invited in December 1997.  My Department is not responsible for the certification of passenger carrying vessels.  The conditions of the contract for each service include that each such service should be operated using a suitable vessel which meets the appropriate classification requirements of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and compliance at all times with statutes, regulations and official recommendations pertaining to passenger service vessels in Ireland.  All vessels for which tenders were submitted for those services were inspected by the inspector of navigation of the waterways division of my Department whose advice was subsequently available to me.  The services to and from the three islands are being operated on a pilot basis for a period of 13 weeks and will be subject to review at the end of that period.</P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997, which was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May of last year, gives legislative effect to the terms of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act is to come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I said in a previous reply to the Deputy, Question No. 146 of 27 November 1997, that the provisions of the Act had not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand and that I would bring them into force as quickly as possible.  Obviously I want to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.</P>
      <P>The Bail Act, 1997, is not framed in such a way that would allow partial implementation of the kind envisaged in the Deputy's question.  As I informed the Deputy previously, I will bring the provisions of the Bail Act into force as quickly as possible.  I am keeping the matter under continuous review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is conducting a review of the rural community policing scheme.  As part of his evaluation he has recently introduced trial modifications to the scheme, under a pilot test arrangement, in two of the 14 Garda districts in which the scheme is currently in operation.  The Garda districts selected by the Commissioner for this purpose are Nenagh and Newcastlewest.  The trial changes relate to the creation of policing teams to provide for improvements in continuity of service to the community and more flexibility in relation to opening hours of stations involving consultation with local communities and an evaluation of local policing needs.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, for the period of these pilot arrangements, which commenced on 23 February, the duration of predetermined opening hours in Athea, Ballingarry, Castletown, Drumcollogher, Kilmeedy and Tournafulla Garda stations will be one hour.  The duration of opening hours, again predetermined, for Abbeyfeale station will be two hours.  The district headquarters station in Newcastlewest will continue to open for 24 hours.  The Garda authorities also inform me that these opening hours have been agreed between Garda management and local people.  As a result of the changes the same Garda teams will perform more foot and mobile patrols in the areas concerned.  Because the same members will be patrolling the Garda teams will become well known and develop a closer relationship with local people.</P>
      <P>I deny in the strongest possible terms any suggestion that these arrangements represent an attempt to close rural Garda stations by stealth. The rural community policing scheme is not, and never has been, about the closure of Garda stations.  It is aimed at providing a better service to the community by allowing gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly while at the same time providing for station opening hours which suit local community needs.  Furthermore, I am on record as stating that no Garda station will close during my tenure as Minister and that this Government has not been associated with and has no agenda in relation to the closure of Garda stations or reduction of policing services to the public.  The position is quite the contrary as the Government's commitment to increasing the strength of the force to 12,000 demonstrates.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the practice of some Garda stations of charging £5 to voluntary youth organisations to run checks for vetting potential staff; and if he will instruct the gardaí to provide this socially important service free of charge, in view of the voluntary nature of these organisations and the fact that they are invariably pressed for cash.</Quest>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act, 1988, the Garda Síochána process requests under section 4 of the Act from individuals for copies of &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; relating to them.  This includes any criminal convictions that may be recorded against them.  It has been noted that many such requests fall into the category of &ldquo;enforced subject access&rdquo;, i.e. where the individual making the request only does so at the behest of a prospective employer.</P>
      <P>The £5 fee is the amount as determined by Data Protection (Fees) Regulations, 188, Statutory Instrument No. 347 of 1988.  The fee is payable by the individual making the request for &ldquo;data&rdquo; and not the voluntary organisation offering employment.  The fee is levied centrally by the Garda Síochána, individual Garda stations have no discretion in the matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that the information provided to an individual under the Data Protection Act, does not constitute a Garda certificate of character, a Garda certificate of reference or Garda clearance.  It is simply a record of information relating to criminal convictions which may be held on computer by the Garda Síochána in the case of any particular individual.</P>

In this context and following discussions with the local authorities regarding the necessary administrative arrangements, it was agreed that students pursuing approved courses in other EU member states, including Northern Ireland, would be paid the value of the grant in the currency of the country in which they were studying and that the value of the maintenance grant to be paid in all circumstances would be the Irish value converted to the currency of the country in which the student is pursuing his-her course.</P>
      <P>Previously, students studying in Northern Ireland were paid the amount of the grant in sterling, without reference to exchange rates.  Those students studying in Northern Ireland who were assessed under the student support schemes prior to 1996 continue to receive their grants in sterling, without reference to exchange rates. Students who commenced their studies from 1996 are paid under revised arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="495" /> It was recently brought to my Department's attention that individual local authorities and vocational education committees were operating different procedures and my Department wrote to all local authorities and vocational education committees in December 1997 to remind them of the arrangements introduced with effect from 1996.</P>

However, the school has not submitted details of the number of pupils requiring the service. My Department's inspectorate is currently investigating this matter.</P>
    <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.  A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools, with effect from September 1997. These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including current responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible. I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <Quest>if it is the intention of his Department to change or review the guidelines which determine a mature student in the context of a grant application, to enable persons of age, living away from home on their own means, to apply and be considered in their own right for grant purposes without carrying out a means test on parents.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, a mature student is defined as a student who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry to an approved course and mature students can be categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents.  An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> Independent mature students are deemed to be self-supporting and are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. An independent mature student's residence for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable under the scheme is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is 15 miles or less from the college being attended, the adjacent rate of grant, £647 maximum, is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college the non-adjacent rate, £1,624 maximum, is payable.  However, where an independent mature student can produce evidence that he-she is maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college, it is open to the local authority to regrd that address as the student's normal residence.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the particular difficulties facing mature students and I have already announced that I will be reviewing the position of independent mature students in the context of the 1998 higher education grants scheme.</P>

      <P>Following a public advertisement in the national print media, the Department has compiled a list of architects, quantity surveyors, mechanical and electrical engineers and structural engineers and this list is used to award design commissions for school building projects in accordance with Department of Finance circular 11 of 1987.  Depending on the size of the project, <Col N="500" /> the Department also uses the list to select consultants who then undergo a further selection process involving a competitive interview.  It is intended to update this list on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these procedures is to ensure greater openness and transparency in the awarding of commissions which are paid from public funds. Secondary school authorities are entitled to engage consultants as they see fit if they are paid from within the school's own resources.  Projects involving consultancy work are subject to the terms of the European Council Directive 92/50/EEC and are also advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities where appropriate.</P>
