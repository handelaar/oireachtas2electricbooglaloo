      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to come into the House and make a statement on the situation concerning TEAM and FLS as we have read in the newspapers today that FLS is threatening to pull out of the offer to buy TEAM?  We do not seem to have heard anything in this House about that.  We have to read about it in the newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>My constituents and the Taoiseach's are concerned about this matter.  I am asking for time in the House to debate this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A request to allow time for a debate in the House has always been allowed on the Order of Business.  Will the Taoiseach talk to the Minister and find out what is happening about the sale of TEAM?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make time available today to discuss the situation arising from a statement by the Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise on radio this morning? He said STAD residents had no case and that there was no legal basis for their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Can time be allocated to discuss this matter today?  Will the Taoiseach indicate if time could be made available for a debate this week or next week because the House has been misled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement should be made by the Minister of State in the House because of the confidentiality agreement between the residents and himself.  The Taoiseach has often indicated that the Whips could examine the matter of a debate.  That has arisen regularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled this matter <Col N="4" /> is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  I call Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a precedent for the Taoiseach to indicate that the Whips could discuss the matter with his approval.  That has happened regularly.  This is a crisis.  Money has been promised in this case and not a brass farthing has been paid over despite taxpayers' money being made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Chair seems to be giving Deputy Stagg far more leniency than he gave me on a matter that involved the same request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled on that matter. That accusation is unworthy of the Deputy. Will Deputy Stagg resume his seat and allow Deputy Joe Higgins to raise his matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled this matter is not in order.  The Deputy may have an opportunity to raise it during the day and he should use another such opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no other opportunities to request time to discuss this matter.  The House was seriously misled.  I believe the Taoiseach wants to respond.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: It is the prerogative of the Taoiseach to recall the Dáil when it is in recess to deal with matters of urgency.  Will he give a commitment that, in the event of a disastrous decision to close TEAM Aer Lingus in a fortnight &mdash; as has been hinted &mdash; if the workers do not give in to blackmail, he will recall the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That question is not in order on the Order of Business.  The Deputy can raise it another way during the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when item 23 of promised legislation, the Posting of Workers (Directive) Bill, will be brought before the House?  This Bill provides for the implementation of a European Union directive which Ireland is obliged to implement following a decision of the member states.  It protects the workers of this and other member states when travelling and working within the Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive must be implemented by 16 December 1999.  The Department is currently drafting the heads of the Bill so it is in the early stage of preparation.  I do not <Col N="5" /> have a definite date but it must be passed next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The High Court recently found that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in breach of the Firearms Act, 1925, and that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is in breach of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  This has led to the cancellation of thousands of visits to this country by hunting sports people and has caused chaos in hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfasts.  Is amending legislation required or planned to address this serious situation?  Will new legislation be brought before the Dáil before the recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy meant to say &ldquo;successive Ministers for Justice&rdquo; since all Ministers for Justice followed that legislation. The High Court made a ruling which requires a legislative response and the legislation must be passed before the Dáil's business this session is finalised.  It will be dealt with next week.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, the ruling would have a huge effect on turnover in the tourism industry during the summer months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Local Government (Planning and Development) (No. 2) Bill be published?  The Bill is due to be introduced following a comprehensive review.  Has that review been completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Local Government Planning (No. 2) Development Bill.  The consultation Bill has 40 heads and is expected to be ready in the middle of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Could today's Order of Business with regard to item 24<i>a</i> be amended?  It is due to conclude at 1.30 p.m. Can that time be altered to 12.30 p.m. to facilitate an hour's debate on the Team Aer Lingus and STAD issues?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking if agreement can be secured to amend the Order of Business to hold an hour long debate on TEAM Aer Lingus and STAD.  That would solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is if the House agrees to an hour less on other items.  That can be done now on the Order of Business in an orderly fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, it is not my place to suggest a method of dealing with this but if the Chair consults precedent he will discover many occasions when the House, in the middle of its business, was approached by the Government with a suggestion that the Standing Order for the day be altered.  That is what Deputy Barrett is suggesting.  If the Taoiseach agrees, it would be in keeping with the practice of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that he did not offer.  He is so respectful of the Chair's authority that he did not deign to suggest that he might offer.  If the Chair asked, the Taoiseach might offer to comment on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Section 27 of the Employment Equality Bill, which deals with the height requirement for entry to the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service, contains a subsection which permits a height differentiation between males and females so a greater proportion of females are not precluded from entry.  In view of this provision, will the Taoiseach instruct the Minister for Defence to change the height requirement for entry of females to the Defence Forces in the forthcoming defence legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 3: In page 4, before section 3, the mfollowing new section inserted:</P>
      <P>3.  &mdash;Section 43 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (2) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(2A) Notwithstanding subsection (2) and section 46(4), direct access from any adjoining land to a motorway or from the motorway to such land may be granted by the Authority to Córas Iompar Éireann in respect of a light railway&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) authorised by a light railway order under section 9 of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, or</P>
      <P>(b) the subject of an application for a light railway order under section 3 of that Act,</P>
      <P>and, accordingly, any such access shall not be a contravention of subsection (2) or section 46(4).&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The background to this amendment lies in the intention that the proposed Dublin LRT will cross the sliproads of the M50 motorway at the Red Cow junction on the Naas Road intersection. It is proposed that a special bridge carrying the LRT over the M50 will be constructed running parallel to the roundabout and on a level with the Naas Road; the light railway will cross the top of the M50 sliproads to gain access to and from the bridge.</P>
      <P>This proposed design was agreed following consultation between the Dublin Transportation Office, the LRT project team, the NRA and South Dublin County Council.  It was agreed that the light railway crossing is feasible and that Luas vehicles would operate within the traffic light system determined by road traffic.</P>
      <P>The proposal is based on a DTO report which shows that it is possible to run the LRT line through the interchange without interfering with road traffic.  Accordingly, planning and design of the LRT have been carried out on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access to the M50 motorway, in the sense in which the layman might understand it, is not envisaged.  It has recently come to attention, however, that the light railway might in law be regarded as accessing the motorway in that it is proposed that it will cross the tops of the sliproads to and from the motorway.  As is regularly the case, the map accompanying the motorway declaration order shows most of the sliproads to be included in the formal motorway: this is done to avoid access being sought to the motorway <Col N="13" /> from land adjoining the sliproads.  In view of the prohibitions in the Roads Act, 1993, on direct access to motorways, it is considered prudent to amend the Act to facilitate the proposal.</P>
    <P>The amendment gives the NRA authority to grant direct access to a motorway to CIE in respect of a light railway proposed under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996.  It is important to note that this power to grant direct access will rest with the NRA which has statutory responsibility for the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads.  All aspects of the LRT design, including the design at the Naas Road intersection, will be open to detailed consideration as part of the statutory consent procedures to be followed under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to accept the advice the Minister has relayed to the House that, for technical reasons and to make the position doubly sure, it is necessary to include a provision of this nature.  Its purpose is to ensure that there are no problems later in relation to the interpretation of access to a motorway.  This is a prudent provision. However, the amendment inserts in the Bill a measure which is one part of the detailed planning of the Luas system.  I do not intend to outline the various misfortunes of the system but this element deserves more than a passing comment.</P>
      <P>The junction at the Red Cow Inn has long been known as the white elephant at the Red Cow.  I usually pass there twice a day on my way to and from Dublin and it is one of the greatest disasters of traffic planning around the city.  What started as a roundabout became a roundabout with an underpass and then became a roundabout with traffic lights and an underpass.  The reason there is a roundabout, an underpass, traffic lights and a railway crossing is that one of the new Dublin authorities has set its face firmly against the idea of providing an overpass at the location.</P>
      <P>I was in office at the time and I am aware that the discussion which led to the adoption of that solution was difficult.  It illustrated a number of factors.  First, despite the existence of the National Roads Authority, we cannot be sure that the authority can get on with the work we want it to do.  Second, certain types of prejudice are alive, well and kicking in some local authorities &mdash; hence Dublin South County Council's refusal to envisage an overpass in the location.  Third, because of this fragmented approach to planning, there will be in engineering and economic terms a seriously sub-optimum solution to the problem of allowing the light rail service to cross the junction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the averagely ignorant layman the obvious way to deal with the situation there, which will be further complicated by a railway line crossing a motorway, is to build an overpass to carry traffic travelling from Clondalkin to Dublin.  This would separate the different levels of traffic and make <Col N="14" /> the operation of the interchange much easier. However, one of the local authorities has set its face against that solution and has successfully stymied the ideal resolution to the problem.</P>
    <P>This shows that the authority which is supposed to regulate and plan for Dublin traffic is a toothless hound.  The DTO does not have the power to compel any of the agencies to agree to even the most obvious solution, which is sticking out a mile.  One of the parties in Government has twice assassinated a body which could have dealt effectively with Dublin traffic problems because it would have had statutory powers to do so.  A Fianna Fáil Government did this in 1987 and the current Administration has also refused to agree to a Dublin traffic authority with statutory powers to deal with various issues, such as this matter. This is a pity.</P>
    <P>There was a time when Fianna Fáil Deputies and the few remaining Progressive Democrats Deputies, who were then members of the Fianna Fáil Party, used to be in a high state of indignation about me and some of my colleagues who were engaged in a sport, which they considered illegal, of quango hunting.  They thought it was terrible to abolish a quasi-autonomous, non-governmental organisation.  Such was their fervour and the mistaken inspiration of their position that when, instead of abolishing quangos, a new body was instituted with specific powers in relation to Dublin traffic, they would not agree to it.  Even today, in face of all the evidence and difficulties which have arisen with the organisation of Dublin traffic, they still refuse to put in place a body which has statutory powers to co-ordinate all the various activities which are required to make sense of traffic in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The result in this instance is the necessity for this amendment to the Bill.  The position at the Red Cow junction is seriously sub-optimum.  The solution will work after a fashion but it is much less than the perfect solution which we should be entitled to require.  There will be less fluidity in traffic at the junction than is possible with an overpass.  There will be more delays in traffic than necessary and the Luas will be delayed at the junction for periods that would be avoided by an overpass.  In five years' time, with the continued growth of traffic, this problem will get worse if the Luas is built in that period.</P>
    <P>I predict that five years after the Luas is built, if the solution provided for in the amendment is used at the Red Cow interchange, there will be a serious problem in terms of the crossover of the Luas and Dublin bound traffic.  This is because the statutory power to implement the conclusion that common sense dictates the solution of traffic problems at that location does not exist.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the amendment, although the solution it is designed to facilitate is much less than is possible.  The reason such a solution is not available is that the Government still refuses to acknowledge, despite all the evidence, that there is a need for an authority with statutory powers to carry out all the necessary functions to regulate <Col N="15" /> and co-ordinate action on Dublin traffic.  It is obvious that if such an authority existed, there would be a much better resolution of the problem at the Red Cow junction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with Deputy Dukes I will not oppose the amendment from the Seanad. As the Minister explained, it will allow the NRA to give access to light rail to motorways and will avoid doubt about the legal entitlement of the authority to do so.</P>
      <P>The Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, has already been amended by the Roads (Amendment) Bill.  This further amendment of the Transport Acts is designed to facilitate the Luas project.  However, few people now believe that Luas will be implemented.  Are we legislating for reality?  It certainly will not take place within the timeframe of the Operational Programme for Transport to avail of the European funding earmarked for a light rail system for Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are two questions that arise.  Is this pro forma action to give the pretence that Luas will be a reality in the foreseeable future, or is there a firm intention on the Government's part to ensure that the traffic chaos building daily in Dublin is addressed in a comprehensive way, with light rail as an integral part of that response? When will we see that in place?</P>
      <P>If the £114 million allocated to light rail development from European funds will not be spent on light rail within the timeframe of the current Operational Programme, by the end of next year, where will that money be spent?  I am informed that the advisory committee are to meet tomorrow to discuss this and other matters.  The Minister of State has responsibility for the road network, but the funding is earmarked for public transport, and I hope it is spent on public transport projects.  Several commend themselves and I am parochial enough to suggest that the rail link between Dublin and Rosslare should be top of the list.  It parallels National Route 1, the Euro route, which is regarded as the prime transport artery in the country.  If it is the prime road transport artery, it is surely the prime rail transport artery also.  The population in Dublin and the east coast is expanding all the time, and it is important not to funnel people to the road system if there are rail alternatives.  It would cost £30 million to upgrade the rail track between Rosslare and Dublin.  There are 11 restrictions on the rail line at present, and I hope the Minister of State sees that this is public transport money, notwithstanding his responsibility for roads.  He will have an input to the expenditure of the European funding, and I hope he ensures that it is divided between the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Public Enterprise.  The money should be expended on worthy public transport projects, of which there are many to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes made valid points on the need for co-ordination in Dublin.  The idea behind the <Col N="16" /> Dublin Transportation Office was to bring the various sectors together, such as the local authorities, CIÉ, in its manifestations as Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Irish Rail, the Garda and other groups.  I do not know if we can say that office is working because it does not have the clout to force solutions.  It is supposed to arbitrate, suggest and cajole, but it has no power to act.  It must be looked at again.  The recent appointment of a director of traffic by Dublin Corporation is another advance, but unless that office has power over Dublin Corporation and other sectors of Dublin's traffic infrastructure, it will prove an impotent post.  There are real issues in the transport sphere that Deputy Dukes has identified and which have to be addressed.  I support this amendment and I hope the Minister of State responds to my comments.</P>

The amendment is designed to provide a legal basis for a particular situation, which is the crossing of the top of the slip roads at the Red Cow, and is an enabling provision. The pros and cons of the design of the light rail system at the Red Cow or any other location must be examined in detail at the LRT public inquiry before the Minister for Public Enterprise can make a light rail order.  In addition, the National Roads Authority has overall responsibility for the national road network and must also give its consent to a light rail line infringing on a motorway.  I am satisfied that these procedures show there is no negative impact on the capacity or safety of the motorway network.</P>
      <P>I am aware of concern regarding the increasing levels of traffic on the M50.  The design of the interchanges on the N7's heaviest traffic interchanges allow for the provision of a third level interchange which would carry traffic on the N4 and the N7 over the existing M50 roundabouts. The provision of this extra lane and third level interchange will greatly enhance the capacity of the M50 at these locations.  The NRA is now carrying out an origin design study which will provide necessary information to enable informed decisions to be taken on these matters and is in discussions with Fingal County Council and the national toll roads in relation to the provision of a second bridge over the Liffey adjacent to the existing facility.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies raised general questions relating to Luas and Dublin traffic.  I do not propose to go into these issues today.  They have already been discussed here and will no doubt be discussed in the future.  Regarding EU funding, decisions will be taken in the next few days on the EU money originally intended for Luas.  Deputy Dukes referred to the Dublin Traffic Authority, but that is not a matter for today's debate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 24, after &ldquo;pattern,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including the co-ordination and upgrading of shop frontages,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7(6)(a)(i) provides that an integrated area plan may, where appropriate to the area it refers to, include objectives for the renewal, preservation, conservation, restoration, development and redevelopment of the streetscape, layout and building pattern of the area.  Deputies Hayes and Dukes proposed an amendment to this subparagraph on Committee Stage which sought to introduce a provision to the effect that these objectives must include the co-ordination and upgrading of shop frontages.  I fully accepted that objectives relating to the co-ordinating and upgrading of shop frontages were appropriate for inclusion in many integrated area plans.  I was of the view, however, that the provisions of the Bill relating to the content of integrated area plans were broad enough to allow for such objectives to be included in plans, where considered necessary, by the local authority or the company preparing such a plan.  The difficulty about making the inclusion of objectives relating to shop frontages mandatory for all plans was that this may not be appropriate in all cases, such as plans for areas where there are large areas of dereliction or environmental degradation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have had a further look at the matter and I am now putting forward the amendment which will incorporate a specific reference to the co-ordination and upgrading of shop frontages in the range of objectives which may, where appropriate, be included in integrated area plans.  The formulation I propose allows a specific reference to be made to the important issue of shop frontages without giving rise to the difficulties I mentioned on Committee Stage.  I am introducing this amendment in response to the case made by the Opposition Deputies last night. <Col N="18" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this amendment.  I fully accept it.  I will even go so far as to say that aesthetically and politically I am hugely impressed by the Spartan economy of the language and the efficiency with which the Minister has translated my original intention.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 28, after &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and having satisfied himself or herself that the council of any corporation or urban district whose functional area is wholly or partly within the functional area of the local authority concerned or to which the authorised company concerned relates has been given a reasonable opportunity to make observations thereon,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment more in hope than expectation. We had a debate on this matter in Committee yesterday and sufficient time has not elapsed for the Minister to profoundly change this view.  The import of the amendment is to require the Minister, before he takes a decision under section 9 of the Bill to designate an area, to satisfy himself that the urban authority functioning in the area has been fully consulted and given a reasonable opportunity to make observations on the integrated area plan submitted.</P>
      <P>From the response I received in Committee, I understand that the Minister fully accepts the thrust of the amendment but has difficulty in relation to the timing in that he feels it would delay the process if the 70 odd integrated programmes submitted had to be resubmitted to the sponsoring local authority or approved authority to ensure that they had a proper consultation with relevant local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have reflected on the Minister's case as well and I accept the validity of what he said, but at the end of the discussions yesterday I asked that the Minister should ensure that there would be statutory provision for this to take place in any future scheme.  I hoped the Minister might have brought forward his own amendment to make provision for that.  Unfortunately, the fact that Report Stage followed Committee Stage so quickly did not give much time for that sort of reflection.  Even a commitment in the House that it would be the intention to include it in any future regulations would give me some degree of confidence that in future the consultation appropriate for statutory bodies at sub-county level would and should take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 of the Bill provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government may, having considered an integrated area plan submitted under section 7 and any recommendations which were contained in or accompanied such a plan as provided for under section 8, recommend to the Minister for Finance that he or she should make an order directing that an area or areas located within the boundaries of an area to which an integrated area plan <Col N="19" /> relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of one or more of the urban renewal tax reliefs provided for in Chapter 7, Part X, of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  It was a matter for each local authority to decide the priority area for which integrated area plans should be prepared and on the arrangements to be put in place locally for the preparation of such plans.  The guidelines which were issued in relation to the selection of priority areas for the purposes of the new scheme and on the content of the integrated area plans emphasised that wide cross-sectoral consultation and involvement should form an essential element in the preparation of each integrated area plan.  The extent of the consultations in the preparation of plans with all relevant interests, including elected members at county, borough and urban level, will be of the utmost importance in considering the question of making recommendations to the Minister for Finance on the basis of the integrated area plans which have been submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>Given the stage the process has now reached, and the uncertainty which could arise in relation to plans which have been completed, I would be reluctant to introduce a retrospective requirement which would in effect make it mandatory for all councils, corporations or urban districts with functional areas within the functional area of the relevant local authority to have been formally given an opportunity to make observations on the particular integrated area plan concerned before any recommendation could be made under the provisions of section 9 of the Bill.  However, I give an undertaking that there will be a mandatory requirement for the various elected bodies to be given a full opportunity to participate in any future arrangements for preparing integrated area plans.  The guidelines in that respect will in future be more explicit.  The guidelines which are provided for in the Bill will be taken into consideration when decisions are being made in regard to recommendations to the Minister for Finance as to what level of consultation did take place.  Preliminary guidelines were issued in May 1997 and formal guidelines were issued in November 1997.  Under the heading &ldquo;Consultation, Participation and Partnership&rdquo; it is stated:</P>
      <P>Wide cross-sectoral consultation and involvement should form an essential element in integrated area plan preparation.  The need for such consultation will first arise at the initial data gathering stage when the needs, strengths and weaknesses of the area are being analysed. The second opportunity will arise when key issues have been identified and draft strategies are being formulated.  Linkages will need to be established between the local authority team preparing the IAP and a wide range of public sector agencies, representative bodies, local community groups, local businesses etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a reference to the possibility of providing support for community organisations to assist <Col N="20" /> them in preparing their inputs to IAPs and to the fact that the consultative process involves the community strategy groups established to promote co-ordination generally between the local development bodies.</P>

      <P>There is a strong requirement for consultation. I am satisfied that nearly all the local authorities involved themselves in extensive local consultation. It did come to light, through the contributions of a number of Deputies, that there may have been areas where the level of consultation was not what we hoped or expected and there was not a full response to the guidelines.  I assure the House that new guidelines will be much more specific in that area and will make that level of consultation mandatory.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister.  My request, in so far as it can be met, has been met by what the Minister said.  I was unhappy with his initial response that cross-sectoral discussions or observations would be sought.  Democratically elected local councils have a unique standing and should not be lumped in with other cross-sectoral negotiations and discussion.  I am satisfied the Minister has given the commitment that in future there will be a binding requirement for proper consultation with all statutory local authorities within the functional area of any authority or authorised company submitting an integrated action plan.  For that reason, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.  &mdash;The Minister shall lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a statement of the reasons for making or refusing to make any recommendation under section 9.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the most important of the three Report Stage amendments.  We had a long discussion in relation to this matter.  There is an important degree of new transparency that I acknowledged on Second and Committee Stages and readily acknowledge again today.  This is a much improved process for designating areas for urban renewal and I congratulate the Minister for progressing matters to this level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This idea was initiated by the former Government. We wanted to do it this way and great credit should go to the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus, who nurtured this concept but it has been brought to its current phase in a Bill before the House by the Minister of State, <Col N="21" /> Deputy Molloy.  I welcome that but the transparency seems to end when it reaches Government Buildings because the final decision on any area to be designated and to benefit under the Taxes Consolidation Act is at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the first instance and, subsequently, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage many Deputies commented on the lack of transparency in relation to this final stage.  I do not wish the Minister to rehearse all the merits of the various other stages, the transparencies involved and the fact that the Freedom of Information Act will apply to the different stages and submissions &mdash; I can envisage what is written down in front of the Minister of State. The bottom line in relation to the final decision-making process is that it is not a transparent exercise. It is reasonable to expect that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who makes the final recommendations to the Minister for Finance, would be required to make a statement on reasons for making or refusing to make a recommendation under section 9 and lay those before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is transparency and it is a better requirement than, for example, a requirement of the Minister for Finance to give a reason for his particular decisions.</P>
    <P>The argument was made in relation to the duties of the Minister for Finance to balance taxes and so on, but this is purely a decision of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who examines the recommendations made to him by the expert group which has had an opportunity to examine all the integrated action plans and, for whatever good reasons, recommends some to the Minister for Finance and does not recommend others.  It is important that there should be a simple reasoning for that decision and that it should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this important amendment which will give a final layer of transparency to an already good and transparent Bill.  It will be to his credit if he is in a position to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Howlin's amendment for a number of the reasons he has advanced and also for other reasons which I will not go into at length because I spoke about this matter on Second and Committee Stages.  I repeat, however, that the final stage in this process of deciding on designations is one where the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Finance will make the final decision, assuming the two Ministers agree on the final decision, as to which areas will be designated.  It is clear that not all of the areas where the proposals are made will be designated. It is not possible to state, from a reading of the Bill and a perusal of the proposals that are made, which of them will be successful and which <Col N="22" /> will not.  I am not imputing any improper motive or improper consideration in any of this; I am simply saying that the final decision made will be an arbitrary one.  I do not suggest it will be made badly or for any wrong reasons.  I am simply saying that in terms of the structure of the measure before us, there are no clear criteria on which one meritorious proposal will be preferred to another.</P>
      <P>For that reason, something at least of the nature Deputy Howlin is proposing should be provided for although it would be a departure from previous practice in tax law because that is what we are talking about.  I would have preferred to see a different method being adopted in the Bill but I realise that is not possible at this stage.  I support Deputy Howlin's amendment and commend that approach to the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an underlying principle in the new approach to urban renewal that decisions on designation of areas for urban renewal reliefs will in future be based on carefully prepared integrated plans which set out a basis on which designation on a selective and targeted basis would assist in achieving the objectives of such plans. Accordingly, the legislation under discussion provides that integrated area plans may contain or be accompanied by recommendations from a local authority or authorised company to the effect that an area or areas within the boundary of the area to which the plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of urban renewal tax reliefs.</P>
      <P>Section 9 provides that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, having considered the integrated area plan and any recommendations contained in or accompanying the plan, may recommend to the Minister for Finance that the latter Minister should make an order directing that an area or areas within the area to which the plan relates shall be a qualifying area for the purposes of urban renewal tax reliefs. It is then a matter for the Minister for Finance to make a decision on whether to make any such order having regard to all of the issues involved, including the extent and nature of any designation proposed and the potential cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the outcome of any submission made by a local authority or authorised company in the context of an integrated area plan will be communicated to the local authority or authorised company concerned, including as much information as it is possible to give with regard to the grounds for any decision taken in response to the proposals of the local authorities or authorised companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will also apply in relation to material in the Department relating to the consideration of plans submitted.  However, the making of recommendations by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is just one step in a process which starts with the preparation of the IAP by the local authority or authorised company and must cross various hurdles before any decision is <Col N="23" /> made on whether and to what extent incentives are to be applied in any particular case.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant, therefore, to introduce a formal reporting requirement on the lines set out in the amendments proposed by the Deputy at one particular stage of a process which could not, at that stage, have terminated and which must of necessity have a degree of flexibility built into it.  For those reasons and all the other reasons we debated at great length last night, I cannot accept the amendment.  Deputy Howlin does not wish me to repeat all the arguments put forward last night when I laid out clearly my views on this matter, but the intention is that there will be as much transparency as possible.  In the communication my Department will make to those local authorities which have made submissions, every effort will be made to explain to them the reasons for decisions in regard to each case.  I cannot give the statutory assurance being sought in the Deputy's amendment because it would place an obligation on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is involved in only one of the processes.  The decision in regard to the actual designation under section 9 is made by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the amendment would not make much sense if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government had to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas the reasons for making or refusing to make any recommendations under section 9.  When he makes the recommendations to the Minister for Finance, as the Deputies know from their own experience, there will be a discussion on any matters of concern to the Minister for Finance and, presumably, agreement reached on the ultimate decision.  Whatever decision is made, it will be acceptable to both Ministers.  The final decision rests with the Minister for Finance <Col N="24" /> who is responsible for taxation and budgetary policy.  Placing responsibility such as is intended by this amendment on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, who merely makes recommendations in the matter to the Minister for Finance, would not be appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the response of the Minister who has not moved one whit from last night in his thinking.  He is deliberately down-playing the strategic importance of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  The other hurdles to be crossed are by local authorities making submissions and developing integrated plans, which arrive on the Minister's desk.  At the end of the day they are considered by the expert group and evaluated and recommendations are made to the Minister. The Minister is the penultimate hurdle, and he will decide what is recommended.  By and large that will be the critical juncture in terms of whether an area is included for designation. There should be transparency in that mechanism. There should be a legal requirement, which is not a great one, on the Minister to state the reasons for including or refusing a recommendation for a particular area.</P>
      <P>I have not asked that the requirement in regard to the final decision be placed upon the Minister for Finance because he has to balance budgetary matters, take into account possible revenue foregone and so on.  This critical issue is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government who is the sponsoring Minister for this Bill.  He is responsible and accountable to the House for his decisions, but there is no mechanism to make him accountable other than acceptance of this amendment.  I am determined that it should be pushed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill introduces for the first time in Ireland a statutory scheme of parental leave.  Under the Bill, parents are conferred with an entitlement to leave from work to take care of their young children. Provision is also made for employees to be given a limited right to time off from work for family crises.  The Bill is based on the EU Directive on Parental Leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline the key components of the parental leave scheme as introduced by the Bill.  The leave will apply to parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996 &mdash; the date of adoption of the EU Directive.  Each parent will be entitled to a total of 14 weeks' leave from work for such a child.  The leave must be taken before the child is five, subject to modifications in the case of an adopted child.  Parental leave is not transferable <Col N="27" /> between parents, i.e. the father may not take the mother's share and <i>vice versa.</i>  The 14 weeks may be taken as a continuous block or, by agreement between employer and employee, in separate blocks or by working reduced hours.  Parental leave is unpaid but is reckonable for the purposes of employment rights other than superannuation. Limited <i>force majeure</i> leave is available for family crises.  The <i>force majeure</i> leave is paid. Employers may postpone parental leave in certain circumstances.  Disputes about entitlements under the Bill are, in general, referable to a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Debate on the introduction of proposed parental leave and leave for family reasons commenced at EU level in the early 1980s under the EC's first action programme for equal opportunities for women 1982-85.  However, it was not until June 1996, that the Parental Leave Directive incorporated a framework agreement which was negotiated between the social partners at EU level.  This framework agreement set the broad parameters for parental leave but left much to the discretion and interpretation of member states. The proposals in the directive are the first instance of a document developed by the social partners under the Maastricht Treaty being accorded the legally binding status of a directive.</P>
    <P>The directive stipulates a minimum of three months' leave for each parent to be taken in the initial years of the child's life up to the age of eight.  This leave is distinct from maternity leave. The directive provides that the leave should, in principle, be non-transferable between parents. Employees must be guaranteed a right to return to work and must be protected against dismissal. As long as the minimum requirements of the directive are met, it is left to member states to determine issues such as whether the leave is paid or unpaid, what pattern of leave is to be allowed, the maximum age of the child and matters relating to social security.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing for parental leave, the directive provides that workers must be given the right to <i>force majeure</i> leave, i.e. time off for family crises resulting from illness or accident.  The directive gives member states discretion in developing the details of <i>force majeure</i> leave.</P>
    <P>The key objectives of the Parental Leave Directive are the reconciliation of work and family life and the promotion of equal opportunities and treatment between men and women. Deputies will agree these aims are highly relevant to Irish society today.</P>
    <P>Over the past 25 years, there has been a massive growth in the number of women in the workforce here.  I quote some statistics which will illustrate the position.  Between 1976 and 1996, the number of women in the workplace grew by 212,000, reaching 488,000 in 1996.  The growth in the number of women at work has accelerated in recent years.  The growth in women in the workplace in the five years between 1991 and 1996 &mdash; just over 100,000 &mdash; almost equalled the growth <Col N="28" /> of women's employment in the previous 20 years. The most recent labour force survey published by the Central Statistics Office last year estimates that the number of women at work was over 512,000 &mdash; or four in every ten people at work.  In the case of women aged 25 to 44, nearly two thirds now work outside the home.  There has been a huge increase in the number of married women at work.  In 1971, only 14 per cent of the women in the workforce were married, but by 1996 married women accounted for 47 per cent of women workers.</P>
    <P>These changes in the structure of the workforce have led to a growing awareness of the need to reconcile work and family life.  The &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; family in which the father is the breadwinner and the mother is the stay-at-home carer of the children is still strong but is no longer dominant in our society.  There has been a rapid increase in the numbers of other types of families, including families of dual earners, single parent families and families where the mother is the sole earner. A study carried out for the Commission on the Family showed that, among families with a child aged under 15, only 49 per cent had one earner, 36 per cent had two earners and the remaining 15 per cent had no earner.  These developments are helping to break the mould in which labour is divided between fathers as providers and mothers as carers.</P>
    <P>In this changing society, there is increasing recognition of the need for measures which will help parents to reconcile the competing demands of work and family.  The introduction of parental leave will not only facilitate the increasing numbers of mothers in the workforce but, equally importantly, as men can also avail of parental leave, will provide working fathers with practical means of involvement in the care and upbringing of their young children.</P>
    <P>The <i>force majeure</i> leave which is also being introduced under the Bill recognises the reality that family responsibilities are not confined to those with young children.  It reflects the fact that all workers, men and women, may find themselves faced with an emergency caused by the accident or illness of a family member and that the employee will have to absent himself or herself from work for a day or so to attend to the emergency.</P>
    <P>The EU Directive on Parental Leave, as I have already mentioned, sets broad parameters but gives considerable latitude to member states in drawing up their national schemes of parental leave.  I will outline some of the considerations which shaped the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>At the time the EU Directive was adopted, Ireland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom were the only EU member states which did not already have some form of statutory parental leave.  We, therefore, had to start from scratch in developing our parental leave scheme, while most other member states had only to make any modifications to existing schemes which were necessary to comply with the directive.  Because of the <Col N="29" /> social protocol, the directive did not originally apply to the UK but was extended to include the UK in December 1997.  The UK, therefore, has two years from that date in which to introduce parental leave.  Consideration of what is proposed there has been announced in a consultative White Paper which has recently been launched by the UK Department of Trade and Industry.</P>
    <P>In developing the Parental Leave Bill, my Department examined the existing schemes in other countries, including the EU member states. However, because of the differing social security systems in the various member states and the diversity of parental leave schemes in operation, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions.  From our examination of the position in other member states, it is difficult to speak of any kind of &ldquo;norm&rdquo;.  In almost every respect, whether it be the upper age limit of the child, the pattern of leave available, or the issue of payment, there is much variation between member states.  Our own domestic legislation dealing with maternity protection and adoptive leave also provided useful precedents, but as maternity and adoptive leave are both based on particular events, this Bill necessarily differs from the earlier legislation in many respects.</P>
    <P>Another key element in the development of the Parental Leave Bill was consultation with the social partners.  The requirement for such consultations is based on the terms of the directive and is also written into Partnership 2000.  My Department has had intensive consultations with IBEC and ICTU about the contents of the Bill.  I and my officials have met these organisations on several occasions, both within the framework of Partnership 2000 and elsewhere, and have given thorough and detailed consideration to the oral and written submissions which they made. Although there was much common ground, ICTU and IBEC had diverging views on several issues relating to parental leave and I cannot maintain that what is contained in the Parental Leave Bill is entirely satisfactory to both organisations.</P>
    <P>In drawing up this measure, my Department had to weigh up a diverse range of factors.  We took into account existing parental schemes in other countries and the divergent views of the social partners.  Subject to meeting the requirements of the directive we sought to develop a scheme which would suit Irish needs and conditions. We wanted a scheme which would be workable, which would not be unduly difficult to administer and which would give clear entitlements to workers but leave flexibility for local agreement.  We also wanted to strike an appropriate balance between the rights and expectations of workers and the needs of business and the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not claim to have achieved perfection.  I am conscious that parental leave and <i>force majeure</i> leave represent a new departure in Irish working life and that these new rights will apply to employees in employments of all sizes and <Col N="30" /> types.  For this reason, I have made statutory provision for the scheme to be reviewed within three years.  Both employer and employee interests will be consulted in the course of this review.</P>
    <P>A key issue we had to consider in drawing up the Bill was whether it should be paid, either by the employer or by the Exchequer in the form of a social welfare benefit.  The Government has decided not to provide paid leave.  To require employers to provide pay for the person who is absent on parental leave for 14 weeks, in addition to the cost of a replacement for that person, would not only be costly for individual employers but would be fundamentally damaging to Ireland's competitive position.  This cannot be advanced as a serious proposition.  Were the Exchequer to provide a benefit similar to maternity leave to all persons who took parental leave, the estimated cost would be £40 million a year in social welfare benefits alone, and there would be substantial additional Exchequer costs arising from the many public servants who do not pay full PRSI.  I do not regard expenditure on this scale as being justified.  The picture in other member states is hugely variable and it cannot be said that paid parental leave is the standard.  While seven member states &mdash; Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Austria and Italy &mdash; provide some form of payment, others provide no payment or do so only in restricted circumstances.</P>
    <P>It has also been asserted that only if leave is paid leave, will men avail of it.  However, with the exception of Sweden, the take up rate by men is extremely low, even where the leave is paid.  In Germany, for example, only 1 per cent of all eligible men take parental leave.  The existence of a link between payment and male take up cannot be demonstrated in countries where paid parental leave operates.</P>
    <P>There is no requirement under the directive that parental leave be provided on a paid basis. The social partners who negotiated the framework agreement left this issue for decision by member states.  Given the significant potential cost to the Exchequer of providing a social welfare benefit for such leave the Government does not propose to provide for parental leave on a paid basis.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill provides that employees on parental leave will be treated for the purposes of all employment rights, other then remuneration and pensions, as if they remained at work.  This means that time spent on parental leave will be counted as service for the purposes of promotions, increments, annual leave, etc.  This is something which was left open in the directive but it was decided that, to enhance the attractiveness of the scheme, the time involved should be reckonable as time at work.</P>
    <P>I am also arranging, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that time spent on parental leave will be credited for social welfare purposes where necessary.  This <Col N="31" /> means no worker will lose out on his or her long-term or short-term social welfare benefits because of time spent on parental leave.  The necessary arrangements do not form part of the present measure but will be put in place once the Bill is enacted by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>In the case of <i>force majeure</i> leave, however, different considerations apply to payment.  The Bill sets tight limits on the amount of <i>force majeure</i> leave which an employee can take in a three year period.  Given these limits, it was decided that the most administratively practical arrangement was to provide <i>force majeure</i> leave on a paid basis.</P>
    <P>I emphatically reject any notion that this is a minimalist Bill.  It is a balanced measure which does more than meet the bare requirements of the directive.  I already mentioned some of the features, such as the reckonability of parental leave for service purposes, the payment for <i>force majeure</i> leave and the protection of social welfare rights, which were not absolute requirements under the directive.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows parental leave, by agreement between employer and employee, to be taken as a number of broken periods or by working reduced hours.  Many existing parental leave schemes in other countries do not afford such flexibility.  Furthermore, although the directive does not specify any form of retrospection, the Bill provides that parental leave will apply to parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996.  Parents of a child now aged up to two will therefore qualify for parental leave.  As regards the maximum age of the child concerned, it was possible to set this somewhere between two and eight within the terms of the directive.  Only Sweden and Denmark have an upper age limit of eight with most member states setting it at about three.  We decided to set the limit at five by which age almost all children have started school.</P>
    <P>There have been some comments and questions in recent weeks about a so-called derogation which my Department obtained from the terms of the directive.  No derogation has been sought from the EU Commission and it is intended to fully comply with the terms of the directive.  The directive sets a deadline of 3 June 1998 for its transposition into national law but provides that member states can have a maximum additional year in cases of special difficulties.</P>
    <P>Last February, my Department contacted the EU Commission seeking to delay transposition of the directive here by six months, that is, to 3 December 1998.  This approach was made because of an assessment at that time of the timeframe for enactment of the legislation and our knowledge of the potential difficulties for employers of having to implement the legislation immediately after the enactment of the Bill.  The Commission acceded to this request, confirming that this would be fully in compliance with the directive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> The parental leave directive, unlike many other detailed directives issued by the European Commission, leaves much to the discretion of member states.  Until the Parental Leave Bill was initiated, employers could not commence preparations for implementing the features of the parental leave scheme contained in the Bill.  Given the novelty of parental leave, it is entirely reasonable that a lead-in time of several months is the minimum that is required.  Therefore, I intend to bring the scheme into operation on 3 December 1998, in line with the approach to the commission.  This interval will enable employer and worker organisations to inform their members about the implications of this measure; allow employers to put systems in place; allow for any necessary modification to existing non-statutory leave schemes which operate in some employments; allow the secondary legislation to be put in place; facilitate Government Departments in making consequential changes and generally permit the smooth introduction of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five Parts as follows: Part I contains preliminary and general provisions; Part II sets out the basic entitlements and conditions for parental leave and <i>force majeure</i> leave; Part III deals with the employment rights of workers who take parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave; Part IV sets out the mechanisms for resolving disputes about parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave and Part V contains miscellaneous provisions.</P>
    <P>Part I has general and mainly standard provisions. Deputies will note the operative date of 3 December 1998 which is in section 1.  I draw attention to section 4, which ensures that the provisions of the Bill cannot be nullified or limited by any other agreement but which allows for arrangements which are more favourable to employees than those provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II sets out the basic entitlements and conditions of parental leave and <i>force majeure</i> leave. The salient features of the parental leave entitlement, as set out in section 6, are: the natural or adoptive parent of a child is entitled to 14 weeks parental leave for each child born, or adopted, after 3 June 1996, which, as I have already mentioned, is the date the Parental Leave Directive was adopted; parental leave must, in general, be taken before the child is five, but this limit may be extended for an adopted child; the employee must have had one year's continuous service in the employment before taking parental leave, but provision is made for an employee who has not had such service when the child is approaching the upper age limit and the leave is not transferable between parents, i.e., the mother may not take the father's share and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Under section 7, parental leave may be taken as a continuous block of 14 weeks or, by agreement between employer and employee, the leave may be spread over a number of periods, by part-time working etc.  A parent with more than one child under five may not, except in the case of multiple births, take more than 14 weeks in a year <Col N="33" /> unless with the employer's agreement.  Section 8 deals with the notice requirements for parental leave.  It provides that an employee must inform the employer at least six weeks in advance when he or she intends to start the leave, how long it is for and when it is to be taken.  The employer may require supporting evidence of the child's date of birth, parentage etc.</P>
    <P>Under sections 9 and 10, the employee and employer must confirm the leave four weeks before it is taken and, once it has been confirmed, both employer and employee are committed to this leave.  This confirmation is necessary to enable both employer and employee to plan with certainty, but they can, by mutual agreement, vary or curtail the leave after it has been confirmed.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows an employer to postpone parental leave for six months if the leave would have a substantial adverse effect on the business because of seasonal factors, the size of the business, other employees on parental leave, difficulty in getting a replacement etc.  The employer cannot, however, postpone leave that has been confirmed. This facility for postponement provides a necessary safeguard for employers and is in keeping with the terms of the directive.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with abuse of parental leave. It enables an employer to terminate the parental leave of an employee if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that the leave is being abused.  The employer may also refuse to grant leave to an employee if he or she thinks that the employee is not entitled to it and must set down in writing the reason for such refusal.  Section 13 sets out the basic entitlement to <i>force majeure</i> leave.  An employee may take paid leave from work if he or she is urgently needed because of injury or illness of a family member.  This leave is limited to three days per year or five days in three years.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with employment rights of an employee who takes parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave.  Under section 14 an employee who is on parental leave will retain all employment rights, other than the right to remuneration or pension rights, while on such leave.  This means that, although the leave is unpaid, the employee will continue to accrue service for the purposes of increments, annual leave etc.  As already mentioned, existing social welfare rights will be protected by the award of credited contributions during the period of leave where necessary.  Such arrangements do not come within the scope of the present Bill but will be put in place by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>However, in the case of <i>force majeure</i> leave the employee is treated in all respects, including pay, as if he or she remained at work.  As mentioned, it was considered administratively impractical to do otherwise for such a limited amount of leave. In the remaining sections of Part III, provision is made for the employee's return after parental leave to the same job or, where that is impractical, <Col N="34" /> to suitable alternative employment.  These provisions are similar to those already in existence for maternity leave and adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Part IV provides for the resolution of disputes about parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave.  The redress mechanisms are modelled on those in place for disputes about maternity leave and adoptive leave.  With the exception of disputes about dismissals, which are covered by other legislation, disputes can be referred by employee or employer to a rights commissioner.  A decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The tribunal can appeal to the High Court on a point of law and decisions of a rights commissioner to the tribunal may be enforced by order of the Circuit Court. Deputies may wish to note the various forms of redress which a rights commissioner or the tribunal may order under section 21.  These include compensating the employee with an award of up to 20 weeks' pay; granting parental leave at a particular time; extending the upper age limit of the child; postponing the leave because of its adverse effects on the employment and, where there has been a serious change in the circumstances of the employer or employee, curtailing, postponing or varying parental leave.</P>
    <P>Part V contains miscellaneous provisions, including the manner in which notices are to be given in proceedings under the Act; how compensation payable under the Act is to be treated in the event of winding up or bankruptcy and a series of consequential amendments to other enactments. These are essentially technical provisions and are covered in the explanatory memorandum. However, Deputies may wish to note the requirement of section 27 that employers keep records of parental leave and <i>force majeure</i> leave and that such records be open to inspection by inspectors under the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  Such records can be used in the event of a dispute or if there is uncertainty about the entitlements of an employee who changes jobs.</P>
    <P>Section 28 requires the Minister to review and report on the operation of the Act within three years of its commencement, in consultation with representatives of employees and employers.  I am conscious that parental leave marks a departure in Irish working life and the fact that it will apply to employees in a variety of employments. This review will provide an opportunity to assess provisions of the Act in the light of experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>I regard the Parental Leave Bill as a key element of the equality agenda for which my Department is responsible.  The Department is committed to pursuing strategies which will bring about a more equitable society.  The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and reports submitted to Government in recent years, such as the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Task Force on the Travelling Community and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities <Col N="35" /> have added momentum for enhanced equality and combating discrimination based on gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.  This Bill is part of my approach in these areas.</P>

      <P>The Bill will give new rights to employees, both men and women and will enable them to reconcile work and family life. This initiative will provide working parents with an opportunity to spend time with their children in those vital years of early childhood when child care responsibilities are at their most demanding. Where both parents are working and avail of the leave, they can, between them, have 28 weeks leave for each child.</P>
      <P>The benefits of parental leave do not flow only in one direction.  Parental leave will benefit employers by facilitating the retention of experienced skilled employees in the workplace and by reducing absenteeism.  Employees whose attention is taken up with endeavouring to achieve a precarious balance between their home and work responsibilities can hardly give their whole-hearted attention to their work.  I do not believe that the introduction of parental leave, as proposed in the Bill, will prove financially burdensome to employers and I urge them to take an understanding and wholly committed approach to its introduction as advantages will accrue to both employers and employees.</P>
      <P>It will be clear that I consider this a key Bill to advance the introduction of family friendly policies which the Government is pursuing.  I look forward to our debate on this measure and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to discuss this issue again.  We are making proper use of Dáil time by airing issues of the day in the House.  If, having met FLS this evening, we believe it is necessary to report to the Dáil tomorrow, I will be glad to do so.  The Whips should note that I will be attending a debate in the Seanad at 12.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>A second opportunity is being afforded to those members of the TEAM workforce who declined to accept the proposed FLS deal a month ago.  They are being asked to respond by 1 July 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The TEAM issue has occupied much of my time in recent months; it is an issue that needs to <Col N="36" /> be addressed.  I have met the trade unions formally and informally on a number of occasions and the executive chairman and senior management of Aer Lingus.  I have also met numerous individual members of the TEAM workforce, particularly in recent weeks, mainly in my clinics. Many members of the workforce took the trouble to come to Athlone to talk to me, not in a belligerent sense but as a way of seeking assurance on various matters, which I was not always able to give them.  However, I was pleased to meet them.</P>
    <P>I have repeated the same message to the unions that I stated in the House on a number of occasions.  Our overriding concern at all times has been to secure the maximum level of employment in TEAM into the future.  Any strategic developments on the ownership of TEAM can take place only with the concurrence of the workforce. That is what I said in mid-December.  The offer of £54.6 million in consideration of the proposed transfer of ownership to FLS cannot be improved on.  My personal understanding of the letters issued in 1990 to each Aer Lingus staff member transferring to TEAM is that they are letters of guarantee of employment in Aer Lingus but, as I said previously in the Dáil, the concept of a job for life is not valid in today's commercial world, where sustainable work must exist if a job is to exist.  My personal belief is that TEAM, as a subsidiary of Aer Lingus, does not have a viable future.  The best prospects for a secure viable future for TEAM lie with the proposals for the acquisition of the company by FLS Aerospace.</P>
    <P>I have stressed to the management that it must redouble its efforts to address the genuine concerns that still exist among the workforce.  From listening to the workers individually, I know pensions remain a major issue.  Despite assurances that the pension arrangements with FLS would at least mirror those already available in Aer Lingus, and could be improved on, many workers still need further reassurances in this area.  Yesterday I asked representatives of Aer Lingus management to explore carefully with FLS whether anything can be done in this area and to bring all necessary legal and pension expertise to bear on this matter.  I put it to them that perhaps the workers could retain the Aer Lingus pension scheme when they become members of FLS, but I do not know if that will be the outcome.  They are investigating the matter.</P>
    <P>TEAM workers also have concerns about the security of employment with FLS.  I have already given my view on that matter, but I accept legitimate concerns still exist.  I will explore that question further with Stephen Harpoth, chairman of FLS Aerospace, when I meet him later this afternoon to determine the certainty of the job offers. My understanding of the FLS position is that it has suspended the due diligence process in light of the response of the TEAM workforce last month, but that it remains keen to complete the TEAM deal and convinced that TEAM, in FLS ownership, would be a formidable and successful player in the aircraft maintenance business.  I <Col N="37" /> would also expect, however, that FLS, which is anxious to expand in that business, would explore other options, but I have no knowledge of any specific options it may be considering.</P>
    <P>My attention and energies are focused exclusively on trying to get the right outcome for TEAM in this situation.  I am concentrating on the efforts of Aer Lingus management this week and next to address all the questions, doubts and worries of the TEAM workforce as best it can.  If, notwithstanding the efforts of all involved in this long and difficult process, the deal falls through, the board of Aer Lingus will have to consider the position very carefully and in a calm manner and then advise me on how it sees the future for TEAM and for the Aer Lingus group as a whole. I asked it to consider that matter and get back to me if necessary, but I hope that will not be necessary. I do not believe it would be helpful for me to speculate on that scenario today.  I gave my agreement to the proposal from the chairman of Aer Lingus last autumn that Aer Lingus should seek a buyer for TEAM.  He did not think at that time the process would prove so complex and lengthy.  Having said that, it is a very major step that is being proposed and we must give it all the time and attention it requires.</P>
    <P>I have stated clearly that in my view the best outcome for TEAM and its workforce, and not just for the Aer Lingus group, is the acceptance of the FLS deal.  We will continue to work up to the 1 July deadline to seek to bring the workers along on this deal.</P>
    <P>On 16 December I stated publicly in the House to the workers and to the management that the future of the jobs rested in the hands of the workers.  I have no better words to describe the position today.  The jobs with FLS are a certainty. Uncertainty lies ahead if the workers do not accept the offer.  They have a clear choice between job certainty in FLS, which has good relations with its employees, which has operated all the European directives and, in a commercial sense, has a fine future, or job uncertainty if they turn down the offer.</P>
    <P>As I stated previously, a job is no longer for life.  I agree the letters written in 1990 stated that the jobs would be forever.  They sounded like a fairytale then, but they sound more like one now. A job must be commercially viable.  Semi-State companies can no longer rely on State aids to prop them up.  That is not allowed and, even if it were, it should not happen.  Transference from a part of a company that is viable and profitable to a part that is not viable or profitable is no longer acceptable.  The workers had high hopes in 1990 that aircraft maintenance was a job for the future. They had heady expectations.  This did not turn out to be the case because there was a downturn in aircraft maintenance and in the aviation industry generally.  They have not got any of the wage increases in the period 1994-98 which everybody else has enjoyed.  Giving parity now would sink the ship overnight.  It would mean a cost of £17 million while the company is operating on an <Col N="38" /> even keel despite an injection of loans and equity of £100 million since 1990.  There is now a chance of decent, certain jobs being provided by a decent firm which will make aircraft maintenance one of its strong core activities.</P>
    <P>I met a considerable number of people individually as distinct from the formal union leadership. Employees have taken the trouble to come to Athlone, a distance of 75 miles, each Saturday. I have talked with them and told them I want them to have jobs with a certain future.  I have nothing to offer if this deal does not go through.</P>
    <P>If necessary I will be glad to return to this issue in the House again tomorrow or next week.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should, in general, concern themselves with matters of the day as well as legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Owen in whose constituency the company is located.  Of the 20 semi-State companies, the most serious and potential crisis arises with TEAM Aer Lingus.  For some months I and my party have been seized by the gravity of the problem. The Government's handling of the sale of TEAM, including the handling by the Minister and the Taoiseach, has been totally lacking in clear-cut leadership.  For almost one year the management of Aer Lingus has stated that the best and only future for TEAM was as part of a consolidated, global air maintenance conglomerate. There is huge change taking place, not only in airlines but also in air maintenance.  The business is shaping into a handful of major companies connected with airlines which will tie up all contracts. If TEAM Aer Lingus continues on a stand alone basis to be wholly owned by Aer Lingus, a small European air carrier, it will not get the work or have the scale, scope and capacity to be a major player.  We are experiencing a very buoyant growth phase in aviation, but TEAM is extremely vulnerable in the event of another downturn.  It will lack the necessary network to ensure continuity of maintenance contracts.</P>
      <P>I disagree with what the Minister said in her speech.  She has failed over recent months to act as a persuader for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote and to say that if she had a vote she would vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, something I said at an early stage.  The FLS option is not perfect for the workforce but remains the most viable opportunity to maximise employment in Dublin Airport for both TEAM and Aer Lingus employees.  The worst scenario is for FLS to walk away without concluding a deal and with no prospective conglomerate for TEAM to join.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus cannot endure a repeat performance of the past six years in financial terms.  I am not attacking anybody when I point out that TEAM lost £100 million over the past six years. This cannot be repeated as the European Commission will not allow a Government inject equity to make up for losses should they desire to do so. It is clear that the management of Aer Lingus does not view the maintenance sector as crucial to its future core business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> Moreover, the issue must be seen in a national context.  The previous and current Governments asked the board of Aer Lingus to examine the question of a strategic alliance for the airline. Therefore, a resolution of the TEAM ownership issue is a prerequisite to the future of a potential strategic alliance which, be it a minority or majority deal, would mean a new network for trans-Atlantic slots which Aer Lingus does not currently have; the potential for huge interlining of ticketing and marketing of sales and the promotion of Dublin Airport as a hub in many different ways in the context of Atlantic and European business.  An alliance offers Aer Lingus a wonderful new future.</P>
    <P>It behoves us all to be constructive and I have no wish to hector anybody.  I have received much criticism from TEAM employees who do not see things as I do, but the hard word is in their best interests.  We should be straight in what we say rather than equivocal.  I met FLS, including Mr. Harpoth to whom the Minister referred, some months ago.  I put the concerns of the workers to the company and the fears among them regarding FLS in the context of its size and its limited duration in the business.  I asked FLS about an employee share holding option.  I understand FLS is putting up £25 million while the workers have already been offered £54 million.  Any further cash will have to come from Aer Lingus, not FLS. FLS said that, while it could not offer shares in FLS Aerospace, it could offer shares in the parent company, something there was a precedent for in its other subsidiaries.  I ask the Minister to break the impasse by asking that employee shares in the parent company be put on the table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my concern at the situation and pay tribute to our Whip, Deputy Barrett, who got the Taoiseach to agree to bring the Minister to the House.  The Minister said she is willing to come to the House any time to discuss the matter, but when we asked for this short debate as she did not offer to arrange it.  We asked for the debate to find out exactly what is happening.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Yates, I believe the deal to purchase TEAM is one we must all endorse and accept.  I would not have said this a number of years ago, but I realise it is necessary for a company to take over TEAM, a company which is viable in its own right, to ensure the 1,540 people working with TEAM have some job security and that the company itself is given security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of dealing with the issue calmly.  I would like to see a little less calmness and a little more strength of resolve.  The Minister must act as a persuader in getting the staff to agree to the deal.  I represent the constituency of Dublin North and I cannot sufficiently stress this. I do not believe the Minister has played a sufficiently significant role since 26 May when she came to the House and explained she would ask Aer Lingus to explain what was going to happen in the future and that she would meet the unions. <Col N="40" /> Why has the Minister, with her persuasive powers, not convinced the unions that this is a sufficiently good deal for them?</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of pensions with the Minister. There are a number of staff in TEAM in their late 40s or 50s who are concerned that shortly after FLS takes over, they may retire.  The business is constantly moving forward in the context of technology, and young people's minds are perhaps more agile in coping with some of these changes.  I do not believe those with pension concerns have had their concerns satisfactorily addressed.  I am very disappointed by this as these form a coterie of people who voted against the deal.</P>
    <P>There are 1,540 people working in TEAM, but there are thousands of others dependent on those staff for their livelihoods and income.  I raised the issue of spouses and children and the many businesses in north Dublin which depend on the salaries from TEAM.</P>
    <P>If something happens the company Aer Lingus will experience a seismic shock.  Aer Lingus cannot deal with its future plans until the TEAM issue has been resolved.  I join my party colleague in asking the Minister, even at this late stage, for less of the calmness she spoke about and to take more robust action as a persuader to ensure the package is accepted.  I am deeply concerned by an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which says a FLS spokesperson would only say yesterday that the deadline for acceptance of the deal is coming very soon and that &ldquo;there does not seem to have been any real progress made&rdquo;.  The whole tenor of the article by Barry O'Keeffe is that FLS is looking elsewhere.  I hope it will not do so before this deal is finalised because many people are depending on it.  I urge the Minister to spend the rest of the day taking whatever action is necessary to get this vote accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a public representative for Dublin North, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Having spoken to a number of TEAM employees in recent months, the Minister's approach to this issue has been contradictory and unhelpful.  She remained silent when talks were ongoing between TEAM management and the unions and when reports appeared in the media in regard to a proposed deal with FLS, no response was forthcoming from her.  The Minister subsequently stated that the express concerns of the workforce had to be addressed.  In this House, she stated that letters of guarantee had to be honoured and conveyed the clear impression the workforce had a veto in regard to any proposed deal.  Speaking on the radio last Sunday, she again intimated the workers had a veto but at the same time said the FLS deal was the best one for the future of TEAM and that workers should accept it.  As far as the workforce is concerned, the Minister's contributions on this issue have been very contradictory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TEAM is vital to the local economy of north Dublin and thousands of families depend on it for <Col N="41" /> their livelihood.  Throughout this debate, TEAM and its workers have been characterised as a millstone around the neck of the national airline.  In some quarters, it has been said that TEAM workers are holding the Government to ransom and holding back the development of the national airline.</P>
    <P>We should cast our minds back to the time TEAM was established.  Aer Lingus workers, notwithstanding their professional opinion of the long-term viability of TEAM, were pressurised into voting for it and received letters of guarantee from the then Minister, Deputy Brennan.  In that scenario, it is nonsense to suggest TEAM was holding back the development of Aer Lingus as nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>I recall voting against my own Government in 1994 when the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, stated the only solution to the issue lay in the Cahill plan.  I did not agree with that and stated that a solution lay in an agreed strategy between the workers, management and third parties to come up with a modified plan.  A modified Cahill plan was subsequently agreed by the workers.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the facts in this case.  There was a lack of proper infrastructure and finance invested in TEAM throughout the years and it was unable to keep pace with developments. Moreover, it was badly managed.  I met management on a number of occasions and found it was not concerned with developing an ethos of productivity within the company.  TEAM workers are now ahead of schedule in regard to the modified Cahill plan, a fact I would like the Minister to confirm.</P>
    <P>The problem of lack of trust and confidence within the company must be addressed.  If one manager said today was Wednesday, another would contradict him and say it was Saturday. Promises have been made throughout the years which have not been honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that insinuation.  Fianna Fáil backbenchers are attempting to turn this issue into a real political football.  We should be talking about the concerns of TEAM workers and the leadership or advice they are receiving from this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of this situation dates back to the time when the Minister's colleague issued the infamous letters of comfort to TEAM workers. The courts have acknowledged the legal nature of the letters of guarantee.  The formation of TEAM as a separate company was dependent on a guarantee being issued to workers.  Without those guarantees, they would not have accepted the deal in the first instance.  Workers are now being told that if they do not accept this deal, there is no future for them.  The Government and the Minister have sent out contradictory signals on this issue in recent months.  How can we have any trust in the industrial relations process when <Col N="42" /> negotiations take place, a deal is put on the table which is put to a vote and rejected, yet the workforce is pressurised to accept it?  That outdated attitude will not help to resolve this problem.</P>

      <P>The workforce must now make a decision on the direction it will take.  I made a statement prior to the recent by-election to which the Minister referred.  In it, I stated clearly that I fully accepted the validity of the letters of guarantee issued by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan. I said I was adamant that the Government and TEAM management should accept the validity of these letters and honour all commitments contained therein.  The proposal to sell off more than 49 per cent of TEAM Aer Lingus is in direct contravention of the previous Government's commitments recently restated by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given particular commitments. A strategic partner is required for Aer Lingus and my preferred option would be for a strategic partner to be found for TEAM Aer Lingus with a minority shareholding in the company.  That option should be discussed further at this stage with FLS.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sceptical about the value of this debate unless we acknowledge we are staring an entirely unnecessary industrial disaster in the face if the present impasse cannot be effectively tackled.  Given the lamentable performance of TEAM management to date, only a deliberate and considered intervention by the Minister for Public Enterprise can avoid the entirely unnecessary collapse of a valuable high skills engineering business.</P>
      <P>To date the Minister has equivocated in the hope that somehow the dispute will resolve itself. Workers who have come to my clinics are taking different meanings and signals from her public utterances.  This is a time for firm resolve and calculated intervention by the Government.  Speaking out of both sides of the mouth is only misleading workers as to the solutions available.  It would be wrong of this House to engage in similar equivocation.  We have reached the juncture where FLS appears to be the only solution in prospect.  It must be accepted that in the medium to long term TEAM can only survive in the third party maintenance industry if a suitable strategic investor is found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trawl to date has produced FLS whose <Col N="43" /> terms remain unacceptable to a majority of the workers.  I am alarmed to hear that some workers are being led to believe that once FLS is out of the way all they have to do is to put together an ESOP with Aer Lingus and everything will be rosy in the future.  That is not possible.  The prospective internal disputes that will inevitably flow from a situation where FLS pulls out will create the most serious problems for the airline.</P>
    <P>In the face of such a major industrial crisis, the Government cannot go on pretending it is a mere onlooker waiting to know the outcome of discussions between management and the unions. The letters of comfort confer certain rights on 1,160 of the 1,560 workers.  They are entitled to a fair price for trading those letters and to have their pension concerns addressed in so far as that is possible.  There is an obligation on the Government to intervene directly to mediate a meeting of minds on the outstanding issues and within a framework of what is possible in the changed commercial circumstances.  An immensely promising enterprise with 1,560 employees cannot be allowed to close.  The Minister's detached hands-off approach betokens disaster.  The Minister said that if, notwithstanding the efforts of all involved in this long and difficult process, the FLS deal falls through, then the board of Aer Lingus will have to consider the position very carefully and calmly and then advise her as to the future for the Aer Lingus Group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We have long since passed that stage.  I heard the Minister say the FLS way is the way of a certain job and the consequence of FLS pulling out is uncertainty.  It is not uncertainty but disaster.  There is no point in Members of this House misleading anybody outside it.  If we are to have any pre-emptive effect at this stage, as distinct from discussing the situation here after the horse has bolted and trying to pick up the pieces then, we must discuss this matter now.  We must honestly tell people the scale of the disaster that is facing us.  It is not only a calamity for north Dublin, but for many people in my constituency who have jobs in the company and who, for whatever reason, are reading different things and taking different signals from what is being said to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition she tortured my life on the Packard closure.  That closure was an inevitable consequence of a down market industry that was going to fold, but there is a future for this company.  The Minister needs to get in there and to stop waiting for telephone calls from Aer Lingus.  It is clear at this stage that Aer Lingus is not capable of solving the problem. As Deputy Ryan said the relations between the trade unions, the workers and TEAM management are disastrous.  There is no trust and no progress is being made.  The workers do not accept we have reached the juncture we are at.  I appeal <Col N="44" /> to the Minister even at this late stage not to equivocate, to get off the fence and go in there and try to get a workable majority in terms of the FLS arrangement going ahead and in meeting the outstanding concerns of the workers.</P>

      <P>This debate is valuable in setting out the grave concerns in the north city and, as Deputy Rabbitte said, in the greater Dublin area about the future of TEAM.  This is in stark contrast to the fanfare of hype that surrounded its opening.  The reliance on TEAM that has been built up in that greater area will be severely affected if TEAM is not transformed in the way we have to contemplate it should to be.  I cannot help but think that if the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, had been elected in Dublin North there would be a much more gloves off hands-on type approach to this matter and we would see her engaging much more directly.  Nonetheless, Fianna Fáil, which was party to the setting up of TEAM, has a responsibility at this juncture.  That legacy may be disowned by some in Fianna Fáil, given the central part played by Charles J. Haughey in the establishment of TEAM.  A question still remains about the hold Boeing seems to have over TEAM in light of the general market which would favour a more European style development of aircraft maintenance.  We should deal with that matter after we resolve this one.</P>
      <P>FLS believes there is a profitable, efficient and highly skilled workforce and business at Dublin Airport and that is also my belief.  However, it is the Government, not FLS, which must decide how to resolve the costs question which must be dealt with.  The choice facing the Government is twofold.  Either it deals with the costs that have grown as part of the TEAM operation, which includes the letters of comfort, work practices and staff situation, or it sells those costs to FLS at a consequential loss.  The first option is the one the Government has a responsibility to deal with and from which it cannot walk away.  Those costs have been built up under Fianna Fáil tutelage and it, as the main Government party, must deal with them.  Responsibility for dealing with them does not lie with FLS and Aer Lingus, but with the Governments given its initial role in the setting up of TEAM.  The courts have proved that the letters of comfort are worth the paper they are written on and more.  It is also true that the TEAM commercial enterprise should have fewer staff and new work practices if the costing structures are to be realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989, the unions called for a realistic pricing structure.  However, they did not receive the response they knew would be required for TEAM to be the long-term sustainable business it could and deserved to be.  The unions have been let down.  They saw the writing on the wall and were realistic enough to ask hard questions but they were not given the necessary answers. Now, another of Charles Haughey's chickens has come home to roost and the Government must face and deal with it.  When one contrasts the profits <Col N="45" /> in Aer Lingus with the failed promises to the staff of TEAM one sees that the Government has a grave responsibility to put right that injustice.</P>
    <P>Lufthansa, Swissair and other airlines are increasing investment in aircraft maintenance and aircraft maintenance costs for Aer Lingus have been reduced.  Fianna Fáil has a window of opportunity to ensure this problem is resolved but the Government must be proactive.  It should not be left to the workers, Aer Lingus or FLS to make the running.  That is the Government's responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes but that initiative was undertaken by Deputy Dukes.  However, it was last autumn when management suggested to me that TEAM should be sold.  I assented to their request although previous Ministers had not.  Perhaps I am wiser after the event.  I can see from Deputy Stagg's smile that he knows what I mean. A great deal will come out on this matter but I will not labour that at present.</P>
      <P>There is no job for life in the letters of guarantee held by the unions.  I said as much in the House two months ago and I said the same to the unions when I met them in December and each month since.  The concept of a job for life is no longer valid in today's commercial world where sustainable work must exist if a job is to exist. Those warm, enthusiastic, glowing letters of guarantee mean only that Aer Lingus will take the workers back because that is what the letters oblige Aer Lingus to do.  However, the workers will be taken back to no jobs.  No sustainable job is contained in the letters.  There are assurances that an employee can again become an Aer Lingus employee but that is no good if there is no job to which he can return.</P>
      <P>Shouting and roaring will not persuade anybody in this situation.  That mode of communication will not resolve the issue if it is to be resolved.  I am the Minister who was in office when passing the parcel stopped.  Several Ministers of different hues occupied the position I currently hold but the music stopped when the parcel was in my lap.  However, I will continue to work through my political persuasion.</P>
      <P>I smiled on hearing Deputy Owen's advice that I devote more time to this issue.  I started working on it last Saturday at 12 noon and it was 11 p.m. when I finished.  All 11 hours were occupied with TEAM personnel.  The same occurred on the two previous Saturdays.  I do not begrudge the time because, thankfully, I am energetic and can give it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also no point saying that I spoke from <Col N="46" /> either side of my mouth.  I spoke openly to each person who came to my office.  I laid out the facts with regard to each letter I was shown, that is, that they are not a guarantee of a job.</P>
    <P>At this mid-point of the year, the only chance of a decent job with a decent firm that has a future is the offer from FLS.  Workers came individually to see me as did members of the union management.  I urge them to think of their spouses, partners, children and their future. There is no point, three or six months hence when TEAM is being wound down and I am bedevilled by Members of the House, saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;. It will be too late to say that then.</P>
    <P>There will be no point bewailing the situation three or six months' hence.  Some Members spoke from three sides of their mouths today and I do not mean Deputy Yates or Deputy Rabbitte.  I wish those Members would be clearer in their comments.  I also wish the union leadership would stop telling its members that there will be a way out of this and that they will keep their jobs.  To paraphrase another woman, there is no other way at this point.  I ask the workers to consider this issue and to make up their minds that this is the way forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main concerns of successive Irish Governments has been, and continues to be, the British nuclear industry and in particular the British Nuclear Fuels operation at Sellafield.  As a result of Sellafield's proximity to the east coast of Ireland and the complexity of its nuclear operations, Sellafield has long been a source of public debate and a cause of concern to the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Public and political opinion in Ireland is firmly opposed to the use of nuclear power for energy purposes.  The Government's policy is clear &mdash; to minimise and, as far as possible, eliminate the adverse implications for Ireland of the nuclear facilities at Sellafield and the nuclear activities in the UK and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>A case is being taken by four County Louth residents against BNFL.  The State is named as a co-defendant in this action.  The Government has offered financial assistance to support the residents in their High Court action against BNFL. Last October, the House accepted a resolution which stated:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to urgently support the legal case of the Louth residents' group against British Nuclear Fuels through the provision of the necessary financial assistance towards research and legal costs as well as the appropriate technical expertise and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following acceptance of the resolution, the Government offered a package of financial assistance to the residents towards the cost of research activities being undertaken by them in their legal <Col N="47" /> proceedings against British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. This offer, which involves financial assistance of £400,000, was duly made to the residents in October last year.  A total of £350,000 of the sum is earmarked for research purposes, primarily scientific research, and the remainder is for information technology purposes to assist the residents in processing documents furnished by the State in the course of voluntary discovery.</P>
    <P>No funding has yet been provided on foot of this offer.  The main reason for this is that one of the conditions attached has yet to be met by the residents.  This concerns an undertaking which the State requires the residents' solicitor to sign and which would oblige the residents' solicitor to furnish to the State all reports received as part of a research programme funded by the State and to keep the State promptly and fully informed about progress of research.  It would also entitle the State to disclose such information and reports to its experts and legal advisers and to make use of such information and reports in these or other legal proceedings which it may see fit to bring arising from the operations of BNFL at Sellafield. Other than this, the information and reports would be treated as confidential and remain the property of the residents.</P>
    <P>Correspondence and discussion on this undertaking have been extensive.  I have met the residents on several occasions in an attempt to resolve differences regarding the wording.  The residents' solicitor has met representatives of the Attorney General's office.  The respective senior counsel have been endeavouring for two months to break the impasse.  All attempts, however, to resolve the issue have proved unsuccessful to date.</P>
    <P>The State's legal advisers deem this undertaking to be an essential prerequisite from the point of view of public accountability in regard to taxpayers' money and from a legal point of view where it is necessary for the State to avoid being involved in an abuse of the process of the court.</P>
    <P>The State is still a co-defendant in this action despite numerous requests that it be removed as a co-defendant.  The October l997 motion committed the Government to support the action against British Nuclear Fuels Limited but it did not commit it to support an action against itself. The House will appreciate the absurdity of a situation where the State would provide significant financial assistance for research activity but would not have use of this research.  The basic difference between the undertaking sought by the State and the counter undertaking put forward by the residents' solicitor is that the State's version would enable it to make whatever use it can of the research if the residents persist with the State as a co-defendant.</P>
    <P>In December l997 the Government approved a further package of assistance relating to work engaged in by the residents' counsel in assessing and certifying proposals for research and in engaging in dialogue with researchers to ensure <Col N="48" /> relevance and admissibility of evidence.  I put these proposals to Mr. MacGuill in a letter dated 12 December l997.  The residents have yet to confirm that they are in a position to accept this offer.  I hope discussions on this second package can commence when the issue of the undertaking is resolved.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the matter of a request by BNFL for details of the State financial assistance to be provided for the residents.  In January l998 BNFL's solicitors requested the State to provide information on the financial aid offered to the residents for research purposes.  The Attorney General's office was strongly of the view that BNFL's solicitors should be given full information on the role the State is playing in this matter. If the State did not disclose these details to BNFL, it was likely to obtain a court order requiring the State to furnish the information at a future date.  Consequently, in March l998 the Chief State Solicitor's office replied to BNFL's solicitors' request providing details of the package of assistance offered by the State to the residents.</P>
    <P>The residents' solicitor subsequently claimed that he had learned of the State's action on this matter &ldquo;by chance&rdquo; and that such details had been released without prior consultation with him.  He requested copies of the correspondence with BNFL's solicitors and sought a categorical assurance that there would be no further release of information without prior consultation.  There was no question of the residents learning of this by chance.  I personally instructed that the residents' solicitor be advised of BNFL's request and the nature of the response that issued.  The residents were copied with the State's response to BNFL's solicitors.  Ireland and the Attorney General continue to be defendants in this action.  In the circumstances the State must be in a position to deal with this action as it sees fit.  It was not possible, therefore, to accede to the residents' request that there be no further release of information without prior consultation with them.</P>
    <P>Discussions which I had with the residents and their solicitor up to now, have by mutual agreement, been carried out in a confidential manner. I have now been informed, however, by the residents' solicitor that his clients do not assert confidentiality in relation to the discussions that have taken place.  Provision was made in the Estimates last year and this year for the provision of financial assistance for the residents.  I have done everything possible to facilitate payment.  The Chief State Solicitor and I have urged Mr. MacGuill on numerous occasions to avail of the funds as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have given my personal attention to the issues involved in detail since taking office.  I am concerned at the delay which has occurred in respect of the drawdown of funds arising from difficulties with the undertaking and have urged Mr. MacGuill to sign it to allow prompt payment of moneys to his clients.  I am in the process of arranging another meeting with the residents and their solicitor, <Col N="49" /> from whom I received another letter today, which may be of significance, in a further attempt to resolve the current difficulties which the residents have with the undertaking which the State is seeking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming the Minister of State but I am not happy about what happened yesterday.  A Government's relationship with parliament is an issue about which I feel strongly. The Government's handling of the Louth residents' group's court action against BNFL since 16 October l997 when the Dáil passed a resolution has been shameful, dishonourable and disingenuous. In its election manifesto this time last year Fianna Fáil, unilaterally and without pressure or equivocation, promised to support the case, financially and otherwise.  This was echoed in the Government's programme.  Last October, untypically, the Government accepted the following Dáil resolution:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to urgently support the legal case of the Louth Residents Group against British Nuclear Fuels through the provision of the necessary financial assistance towards research and legal costs as well as the appropriate technical expertise and information.</P>
      <P>Not one penny has been paid by the Government to the LRG or its legal representatives despite the public being misled into believing that the Government was actively supporting the case. Specifically, court fees and drafting fees have been precluded from the offer of payment. Undertakings have been sought for payment of research expenditure.  In return, the LRG has sought to ensure any research documentation would not be obtained by BNFL and its representatives. This is a reasonable and prudent consideration from its point of view.</P>
      <P>The Government has tried to portray the LRG and its legal representatives as being unreasonable and inflexible.  This is most unfair.  They have never sought to be involved in political controversy, they are ordinary County Louth individuals who, in a public spirited sense and at great personal cost, have sought to fight the health hazard posed by Sellafield in the only way open to them. They have been betrayed in their legitimate expectations arising from the Government's acceptance of the Dáil resolution.  They fear elements in the Government apparatus do not believe in the viability of the case and that unlimited access to some of their documentation could sow the seeds of the loss of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of removing the State as a co-defendant <Col N="50" /> is a red herring.  The LRG has never been intransigent on this point which is not irresolvable. Sooner or later the Dáil resolution will be retabled to test the Government's bona fides on the matter.  As six months have elapsed since the last debate, the motion is eligible for retabling.  In the interim I call on the Government particularly the Taoiseach, who made personal commitments to the House on the matter, to honour their pledges wholeheartedly and without further conflict or delay.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the issue is that the Minister will pay the money if the group will sign the undertaking. The Minister gave the game away when he said the basic difference between the undertaking sought by the State and the counter undertaking put forward by the residents' solicitor is that the State's version of the undertaking would enable the State to make whatever use it can of the research if the residents persist with the State as a co-defendant.  This means the research could be given to any third party.  The Government could rubbish it or say that it had gaps.  This is exactly the fear of the residents.  They want an undertaking that BNFL will not see any of the research and that any limitations or vulnerabilities in it will not be exposed to the detriment of the case.  This is the critical point.</P>
    <P>Despite its promises, the Government has sought bureaucratic delays, inserted new preconditions and denied payment to date.  I ask the Minister to outline the position regarding fees for the two cases that are before the courts.  In addition, BNFL has sought from the LRG a statement of claim and particulars.  These are legitimate expenses.</P>
    <P>I understood it was agreed that an accounting system, based on invoices, would be put in place for research on health related and IT issues.  This was the generally acknowledged procedure and it was understood that the motion would resolve this issue.  However, this has been thrown out the window and new preconditions have been put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The position now is that the legal advisers to STAD have sought an undertaking that the documentation which they are prepared to give to the Government &mdash; my view is that they are prepared to release the State as a co-defendant &mdash; would not be released to any third party without their consent.  This is a reasonable undertaking to seek.  If I was taking a civil action against a person and somebody else offered to support me, it would be a reasonable and prudent undertaking to seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ultimately, there is a view that the Government or the Attorney General does not believe in the viability of the case and, therefore, there is a capacity to damage it.  There is no point in the Minister saying at a future date that the Attorney General has given further advice.  All this advice was available to the Minister prior to 16 October <Col N="51" /> when the Government freely accepted the motion.  The group has been unjustifiably let down.  The Dáil resolution has been flouted and reneged upon.  The Minister must intervene at a political level to ensure that a reasonable agreement is reached regarding third party access to the documentation and the release of the State as a co-defendant.  The Minister must be pro-active on this issue.  The only winner in a stand off is BNFL.</P>
    <P>Today's newspapers contain reports of the statement by Dr. Gordon Thompson, an American expert in this area, that the risk posed by a potential accident at Sellafield is between ten and 100 times greater than the damage inflicted by the accident at Chernobyl, the consequences of which do not need to be emphasised.  This is the objective opinion of one of the foremost experts in the US nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>There was unanimity when this matter was last debated.  In good faith the Minister was given eight months to proceed.  This side has not made a political football of this matter, but I condemn the lack of pro-active determination at a political level to ensure that money is paid for bona fide research carried out on an invoice basis and the State is ultimately removed as a co-defendant. Third party access to the documentation should be on a consent basis by the LRG legal representatives. This is the formula to solve this issue.  I am not attempting to score political points.  I want to ensure that a resolution to the issue is found which will allow the case to proceed.  We do not want BNFL to be able to up the ante and weaken the position of the LRG.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate.  However, the Minister's speech conveyed an attitude that if the State is to be a co-defendant, it may wish to defeat the case. The Minister has been somewhat duplicitous in that and I regret the money has not been paid.  I call on the Taoiseach to intervene on the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The nuclear complex at Sellafield is the greatest single threat to the health and well-being of the Irish people.  This has been accepted by successive Governments.  However, since the change of Government, there has been a deafening silence on the issue from the Minister and the Government.  There has been inactivity.  Under pressure in the House, a committee dealing with Sellafield was re-established.  However, it does not meet.  The move was simply window dressing.</P>
      <P>I will address three issues.  The first is the litany of broken promises regarding firm undertakings and decisions of the Government and the Dáil. The election manifesto of Fianna Fáil promised to cover the full cost of the case.  However, no action has been taken.  Money has not been given to the group.  A previous speaker quoted the Dáil motion, which was supported by the Government. This has been flouted by the Government and action has not been taken on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Book of Estimates contains a provision of £200,000 and a promise of £400,000 from the <Col N="52" /> Government.  However, not a brass farthing has been issued to the Dundalk residents for the costs they have incurred on foot of these firm promises. Legal representatives who have incurred costs have not been paid.  Research and technical staff have not been paid and may end their contracts as a result.  STAD has been set up by the Government and left high and dry.</P>
    <P>It is a critical stage in this matter.  STAD has been requested by BNFL for a written statement of claim and this must be provided.  A written notice of particulars, with 133 questions outlined by British Nuclear Fuels, has been received by the group which is without resources.  Not a penny of the taxpayers' money which was provided by the House has been paid by the Minister to the group.  There has been a litany of cleverly designed red tape to ensure that no money could be drawn down.  In common with Deputy Yates, I call on the Minister to cut across this red tape and ensure some action.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to statements made by the Minister in the House on a number of separate occasions.  Opposition Deputies have been severely restricted by the Minister of State repeatedly stating that there was a confidentiality agreement between him and the Dundalk residents.  On 16 December 1997, the Minister of State said that, by mutual agreement with the residents, he did not believe it helpful to comment further on the details of the discussions at that stage.  On 3 June 1998 he said that the discussions were, by mutual agreement, being carried on in a confidential manner and that further comment would not be appropriate at that stage.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies were inhibited from getting information arising from these statements by the Minister of State.  We discovered that no such confidentiality agreement ever existed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote from a letter from the group's solicitor, dated 19 June, which he sent to me and to others:</P>
      <P>Because of the pressure we are now under to deal with the notice of particulars, we have had to bring the matter once more to the attention of other Deputies in the House.  We were surprised to learn from them that they have been unable to obtain detailed information from you as you have indicated that you consider yourself bound by a confidentiality agreement with us in relation to the conduct of the negotiations. No such confidentiality agreement exists, as is illustrated .</P>
      <P>The letter goes on to cite instances of the Minister of State giving information outside the House about the situation.  This is a serious matter and the Minister of State must clarify whether such an agreement existed.  If not, he should set the record on this matter straight, because it is an important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has undermined the case <Col N="53" /> being taken by STAD.  We have been told that the Attorney General has given certain advice, but we have also been told that that advice is confidential and cannot be discussed even in the House.  There was an example of this recently in the debate on the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal.  However, the Minister of State has no such inhibitions.  He went on his local radio station this morning and, deliberately and cold-bloodedly, gave the negative advice offered by the Attorney General to the Government in this case.  We had a similar incident, though it was not as coldblooded, during a debate at the end of last year.</P>

      <P>It is outrageous that that Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, are seeking to deliberately sabotage the Dundalk residents' case.  I ask the Minister of State to explain to the House why the Attorney General's advice is confidential in one case while it can be used in another to undermine the case of the Dundalk residents.</P>
      <P>I recall the proposal to build a massive underground dump at Sellafield which would be irreversible and unchangeable for all time.  I was advised at the time that I should not go to the public inquiry, that if I went I should not speak and that there was no hope of winning the case. I rejected that advice and hired an outside legal team, headed by Professor Elihu Lauchterpacht. I attended the public hearing, addressed it and we won the case, stopping the dump from going ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should not take all the advice he is given, either by the Attorney General or other experts.  They are regularly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next target was the storage of highly radioactive liquid waste in tanks at Sellafield.  There are 21 such tanks and they have been identified by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland as the greatest single risk to Ireland at Sellafield.  These tanks must be constantly cooled or they will explode.  If one exploded, it would be equivalent to ten Chernobyls.  If an aircraft crashed into one, if there was a terrorist attack or an earthquake, we would have Chernobyl multiplied by 200 on our doorstep.  That is a doomsday situation and there is a real danger that it could occur.  Despite the unbelievable implications, neither British Nuclear Fuels nor the British <Col N="54" /> Government has any plans for dealing with such an occurrence.  If it occurred, and it is possible, Irish agriculture would be wiped out for the foreseeable future; we would not be able to eat produce from this country.  Tourism would go and many people would die.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should deal with these matters in his response.  All his energy seems to be expended on tying up STAD with red tape to ensure that the money voted by this House to STAD is not paid to it.  I ask him not to assist British Nuclear Fuels by feeding it information that is the result of STAD research or otherwise. He must be proactive and must fulfil the undertakings to pay the money to STAD.  There must be no further sabotage of the STAD case.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister of State that the Sellafield complex is the biggest single threat to the health and well-being of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>It is now 12 months since we had a change of Government and it is now clear that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government does not regard the Sellafield issue as a priority.  This Government inherited from its predecessor an unprecedented record of activity and success on the Sellafield issue.  As Deputy Stagg said, the Nirex dump was stopped, legislation was enacted to prohibit radioactive dumping at sea, action was taken to counter the hazards of shipments of nuclear waste, a range of initiatives was undertaken at international for a such as OSPAR and the IMO, it became a subject of discussion at prime ministerial level for the first time and the activities of the various Government Departments and agencies on Sellafield were being co-ordinated through an interdepartmental committee for the first time.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the change in Government last year has resulted in the urgency going out of the Sellafield issue and we are now back with ritualistic expressions of concern from Ministers which get us nowhere.  Specifically, the promise made by Fianna Fáil to fully fund the STAD case has been reneged on.  To date not a single penny has been paid.  It was a classic Fianna Fáil election promise. The previous Government had undertaken to provide financial support for the STAD case, but Fianna Fáil had to go one better.  It was going to fully fund the case.  The message was quite clear: it would provide whatever funds were necessary for the entire case.  That is now clearly being reneged upon, but worse than that, the Minister of State with responsibility for the area, and Deputy Dermot Ahern in a previous debate, have effectively undermined the case by making public statements that suggest there is no basis for the case in the first place.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile the situation at Sellafield is getting worse.  The discharges of technetium 99 from Sellafield are now 250 times what they were five years ago.  The seabed near the Sellafield outfall is now so contaminated that it would itself be classified as nuclear waste if it were on land.  The report published yesterday by the Institute for Resource and Security Studies suggests that there is now in Sellafield the potential for a nuclear accident which would be worse than Chernobyl.  The Dounreay plant is to be closed, which will mean that there will be increased activity at Sellafield.  The German authorities have banned the movement of nuclear waste, yet our Government has taken no action to halt the shipments of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea, and the Government committee which is supposed to be co-ordinating activities between the different Departments has met on only two occasions since this Government was formed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Sellafield is now more dangerous, more polluting and poses a more serious threat to the safety and security of this country and its people than it has ever done before, and this Government has taken its foot off the pedal.  We need three things &mdash; the implementation of the resolution which was passed in the Dáil on the STAD funding, the publication of the Government's position in advance of the OSPAR ministerial meeting next month, and for this Government to give this issue the priority the previous Government had been giving to it and on which we are being very badly let down by the present Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>All organisations have their foundation stories.  In the case of the Green Party, whenever old heads get together they will eventually get around to reminiscing about Carnsore and the popular effort there in the late 1970s and early 1980s to oppose plans, promulgated in Government by Deputy Des O'Malley, to site a nuclear plant there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The realisation dawned on people in the years after Carnsore that there already was a nuclear power plant, vastly bigger than anything planned for County Wexford and approximately the same distance from our biggest centre of population, Dublin.  Windscale, as it was known then, became a touchstone issue for the emerging Green Party in the early and mid-1980s.  When others argued that because the nuclear industry supplied 25 per <Col N="56" /> cent of the UK's energy usage it had to be regarded as being there to stay, the Greens held to a simple and easily understood principle &mdash; that in ecological, environmental and human terms nuclear fission is simply too expensive and too dangerous a way to meet society's energy needs.  That principle has not changed.</P>
    <P>In the future the world will wonder why the 20th century put so much faith in the nuclear industry.  What we have witnessed in the two decades since the formal establishment of the Green Party has included the Three Mile Island catastrophe and the horror of Chernobyl, but also the recently announced closure of Dounreay.  The closure of Dounreay marks the beginning of the end of the nuclear industry on these islands.  It tells us, who have known for so long that Sellafield must be closed, that now Sellafield can be closed.</P>
    <P>The corner has been turned.  An important expression of that is the inspired action of four individuals, Mary Kavanagh, Constance Shortt, Mark Deary and Ollan Herr who, as STAD, have in effect asked why should this threat of death and destruction hang over all of us and our children in a horrible doomsday scenario arising from an accident or, by instalments, from every day's releases and emissions.  They have nothing to gain should they win this case above and beyond what everyone who lives in and cares for this country has to gain.  However, this Government, despite promises made very publicly by Fianna Fáil, believes it has everything to lose, should they lose.  In spite of the very considerable weight of evidence, added to again today by the General Council of County Council's support, Fianna Fáil is again simply refusing to co-operate with them. It reminds me of the promise by Fianna Fáil prior to the election in relation to GMOs where again it said it would, in Government, stop the deliberate release of GMOs.  It was an entirely cynical and opportunistic election ploy.</P>
    <P>How serious is this Government about the Sellafield issue?  Deputy Stagg raised the question of the storage tanks.  Has this been addressed by the subcommittee, and how often does the subcommittee meet?  What diplomatic pressure has been applied to our fellow EU member state, Germany, and to Japan to stop the supply of nuclear waste being shipped up the Irish Sea for reprocessing?  Has the Government made a decision to adopt a victim mentality in the face of the nuclear industry, taking the attitude that since we cannot directly control it we will ignore it and hope it will go away?  Substantially, Governments create the realities they experience.  This Government has the opportunity to be part of the solution to Sellafield by keeping its promise to wholeheartedly support STAD.  Instead, it seems it has decided to remain attached to the problem posed by Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The people deserve a more constructive attitude. Successive Governments have talked about Sellafield.  They have looked upon it opportunistically as a nice electoral issue while in Opposition. <Col N="57" /> In Government, however, it has been an entirely different story.  I am convinced, now more than ever, that the only way Sellafield will be closed is when the Greens form part of a Government, because we will not become part of a coalition arrangement unless and until there are concrete proposals which are deliverable for the closure of the plant.</P>
    <P>Sellafield affects us all.  If any evidence of that is needed, a report carried out by the UK Department of Health and published last year which analysed the results of a survey of 3,300 teeth taken from adolescent children from Wexford to Antrim and from Kent to Scotland found that plutonium from Sellafield is in their bodies.</P>
    <P>What has been revealed today is an indictment of this Government.  I ask the Minister to stop talking about this issue and do something.  These people are entirely reasonable ordinary people. They are looking for the support of the Minister of State, and he has betrayed them.</P>

      <P>If this matter were not so serious, the bluster and rhetoric I have listened to for the last few minutes would be totally amusing. This Government has been in office for 12 months.  It is vigorously continuing the campaign against Sellafield, which it undertook to do in its programme for Government.  The previous Government blustered and indulged in rhetoric for three years.  I commend Deputy Stagg, as I have publicly done before, for what he took on board and dealt with.  It was a meritorious piece of work.  However, we are not comparing like with like here today.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach last answered questions about the board he said he hoped it would be able to assist in bringing private sector investment into infrastructural projects here. In view of the urgent need to bring private sector money into the development of water, sewerage, telecommunications and other infrastructural projects, what progress has been made in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the issues discussed on 18 March at the meeting with members of the board was private sector investment and the supply of venture capital.  It was not a question that they would bring in the money, but since those individuals are involved in finance companies and other companies dealing in this business, their advice would be important on this matter.  If some of the companies involved were asked about investing in such projects I have no doubt they would be interested, but they would see it more as an issue for the Irish market.</P>
      <P>When those companies come here, hopefully in the autumn &mdash; it is a question of attracting a large number of them &mdash; they will make a significant input to the private-public partnership initiative. They have an amount of experience in this area which will be useful to this country.  I would like them to talk to people in the finance world who could invest money in projects here rather than do so directly themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

If the funds available are not being invested it is because the Government has not produced the financial investments into which the money can be placed.  What is the Taoiseach doing about that?  I disagree with his view on where pension funds should invest.  Given the nature of pension funds, they should spread their risk across a number of economies.</P>

      <P>I discussed that matter with and received comments from a number of members of the advisory board.  The Government has since moved on from the IBEC document.  The Department of Finance recently put a comprehensive memorandum before Government on this issue, <Col N="62" /> which is due for discussion again.  I hope to discuss that matter with a number of Irish financial institutions.  I have already got their views so that the Department of Finance can proceed on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is correct in that there is an enormous number, £1.5 billion worth, of water, sewerage and drainage projects in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and it is important that we find a mechanism to progress this matter.  I had a number of meetings with Ministers about progressing the capital programme for roads and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has been working on initiatives in that area.  We should use private finance in these schemes because we will never have a sufficient capital programme to deal with them.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that IBEC made a detailed submission to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government about private-public sector partnerships in regard to water, sewerage and roads, will the Taoiseach consider inviting IBEC to join him the next time he meets the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board?  Perhaps that might be the most appropriate way to advance this project so it will be able to attract American as well as domestic funds into these urgent projects, the lack of which is driving house prices through the roof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to that.  I met IBEC and, as I said, its document is being used partly as a catalyst for an existing Department of Finance document.  It has shown initiative in this area, which I appreciate.  I hope the Americans will be able to meet some of the banks and finance houses here to try to get the scheme to work. There were many problems with public-private finance schemes or partnerships developed in the United Kingdom.  It has worked through them but faced many downs as well as ups.  We should look at the experience in America and the United Kingdom to try to get it right.  That is the way to go, which I support.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 17 consultants engaged by my Department and the bodies under its aegis.  Six of these relate to my Department and 11 relate to the bodies under its aegis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach need all these consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Six consultants are working in my Department.  I am sure this question is motivated <Col N="63" /> by the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who examined consultancies engaged by Departments from 1994 to the end of 1996.  I welcome the report as a very useful study on the use of external consultants.  It highlights the need for Departments to focus on the issues involved in engaging consultants and obtaining the best value for money.</P>
      <P>In many cases, consultancies are done because people are second-guessing or those in the Department do not have the expertise.  Consultancies are quite costly, as we have seen from the report.  The Committee of Public Accounts will examine the findings of the report this month and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance will also bring forward proposals.  The Department of Finance is committed to taking on board the recommendations in relation to the guidelines, which it will issue to consultancies in the future.  We should be slower to engage consultants because it is quite costly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that much of the time consultants are employed by Departments which already know what should be done but do not have the courage to make the decision and want somebody else to tell them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be the case.  My objection to consultancy reports is slightly different in that when they report, they do not give clear recommendations and too often they say either on the one hand or the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When one studies the recommendations, one almost needs another consultant to explain them.  It would be better if conclusions were reached.  Sometimes it would be as quick if an official or somebody else drew up a report. Over the years we have built up a type of consultants fever in that we tend to act on the recommendations of consultants rather than on those of good, sane people in the public service.</P>
      <P>I have tried to avoid bringing in too many consultants. Yesterday, I defended a good report on consultants involved in a CD-ROM project in the Office of the Attorney General.  I congratulate them on the work they are doing.  Sometimes consultants are needed to do a job.  It is more beneficial when consultants are employed to do a job and bring something to a conclusion rather than simply second-guess people and issue a report. The brief I read the other night would suggest some of this type of information is extremely costly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Does the Taoiseach agree that as long as there is adequate transparency there is often no good substitute for an old fashioned political decision and that frequently the resort to consultants occurs because there is an unwillingness for whatever reason &mdash;<Col N="64" /> this can occur in all Administrations &mdash; to make the political call?  Does the Taoiseach agree that is the most constructive conclusion to be drawn from the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but as Deputy Bruton knows as well as I do, the good old-fashioned political calls made some years ago were different from those made today.  If one makes a political call today, one would probably find oneself before a tribunal.</P>

When will that report be available given that it is nearly two years since these people were appointed?  Is he aware the initial soundings from the report were totally contrary to what they were asked to do in the first place?  Will he assure us that fees will not be paid because of inefficiency in this matter and that fees will only be paid in respect of the work which was requested of these people?

Given the great concern that there is not enough information about Europe, as expressed by many people in the recent Amsterdam Treaty, how many times has the Communicating Europe task force met since it was transferred to the Department <Col N="66" /> of Foreign Affairs and how many times has the Taoiseach's Department attended to such a task force?

Chancellor Kohl has laid out a programme in conjunction with the Commission and in co-operation with Chancellor Klima that will ensure the negotiations are concluded by the March deadline.  Certainly that is the intention.  It is hoped that between September and the Vienna Council, which will take place in early December, they will have moved to the stage of taking final decisions on Agenda 2000.  Most of the homework and the analysis will be done.  In the first three months of the German Presidency it is intended that it will be all wrapped up.  That is Chancellor Kohl's intention at this stage.  It depends on what happens later in the year.  As Deputy Bruton is aware, when the Commission works to a time-table it normally meets it or thereabouts.  The European Council, the Commission and the Parliament are anxious that this Parliament conclude <Col N="69" /> on these matters and that they are not left over. The view is that if they cannot complete it in 1999, it will drift into 2000.  Since we are talking about the financial perspective that starts on 1 January 2000 they should not bring proposals into a Parliament for 2000.  That makes sense and that is the programme we are working to at this stage.</P>

      <P>In view of the absolute necessity to complete this work before the termination of office of this Parliament and of the Commission, the March deadline has a certain degree of political logic attached to it, although there are the risks to which Deputy Bruton has referred.  From the point of view of maximising Ireland's national interest and the fact that the Taoiseach said in his reply that this group will be finalising its negotiating position in the second half of September, will the Taoiseach bring forward the proposals, in whatever is considered an appropriate form for discussion in this House, in order that the Oireachtas can have a clear voice and input into the negotiating position of the Government between October and March of next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly listen to what is been said in the House and I have no difficulty about a debate in the House.  So far as laying down for others our negotiating hand, I do not think that should be done.  If we have a debate in the autumn parties and individuals could express their views.  I know from speaking with colleagues in the European Council that everybody is operating on negotiating positions.  Clearly they are working out other strategies and formulas and will not show those in public or to the Commission or the Presidency until the negotiations get into the final period.  I recall the last two rounds &mdash; Edinburgh in 1992 and the earlier discussions in Brussels in 1989, in which I was involved, one of which finished at 4 a.m. and the other at 3 a.m. Unfortunately that is how these matters go.  People show their final hand in the final hours.  We have to be clever as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Taoiseach to weaken the hand of the Government by showing it too extensively.  What I am offering is the contrary. Will the Taoiseach agree that, if there were a comprehensive debate in the House on Agenda 2000, especially on the sensitive area of agriculture and the reform of CAP, and if all the participating social partners affected by the consequences of Agenda 2000 were allowed to contribute to it in a democratic and open way, it would strengthen the hand of Irish negotiators?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with having a debate in the House on the issue.  Agenda 2000, like previous rounds, is very important and the Common Agricultural Policy will be dramatically affected, although no one knows what that will <Col N="70" /> entail.  I readily agree to a debate on it in the House as it would be of benefit.</P>

      <P>Have the Ministers and Secretaries Group considered the Schengen agreement given the Cardiff Summit statement that progress is being made for Norwegian and Icelandic citizens, who are not citizens of the European Union, to have greater ease of access to the European Union than Irish citizens when the Schengen agreement is incorporated in the treaty?  While this is not a problem of the Taoiseach's making, I point out the necessity for him to try to find some way to allow Irish citizens to travel within the European Union without having to show a passport.  There would be great resentment among Irish citizens that people from Iceland and Norway, who are outside the Union, will not have to show a passport while they will.  I urge the Taoiseach to have the Ministers and Secretaries Group continue to examine this.  It may be possible to obtain a concession allowing Irish citizens to travel by showing, for example, a driving licence or a similar identity document.  It is something about which we should be concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently there are a number of honours which can be bestowed on individuals by educational and cultural institutions, local authorities and Government Departments and agencies.  The issue of a State honours system has been mooted many times in the past but there has never been all-party support to sustain its development from a fledgling idea to an actual system of honours.</P>
      <P>As we enter the 21st century it is now appropriate to examine the issue and to show our maturity by possibly putting in place for the millennium a system to properly honour those in society who have made a fundamental contribution and not to leave it to other countries and organisations to do it for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the overriding concern must be that this be done on a non-party political basis and I intend to write to party leaders in the House asking for their views on how we should proceed.  If <Col N="71" /> there is support for the idea across a majority of parties, I would then be happy to examine the matter in greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's reply. It never struck me more forcefully than when Limerick County Council made a presentation to Dr. Ed Walsh, a colossus on the education stage, that there should be a national recognition system to honour the great contribution people like him have made to society.  I tabled the question for that reason although it was raised before.  I am pleased with the Taoiseach's response that it is being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will write shortly to party leaders and I ask them to consider it.  I understand the difficulties having read extensively from the file on the subject.  This has been debated for 68 years; the first memorandum is dated July 1930.  The issue dates all the way back through various Taoisigh to the days of the Executive Council.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we do not have a system.  Many Irish people are now the beneficiaries of honours of one kind or another in other jurisdictions, yet we have no adequate means of recognising them here.  There are the Gaisce presidential awards which perform a useful function in a specific area, but they do not relate to the question tabled by the Deputy.  I would like to make another attempt.  Deputy John Bruton has been positive about it in the past but I do not know the Labour Party's view.  It is worth examining to see if we can devise something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the former Lord Mayor of Dublin, the Taoiseach will be aware that granting the freedom of the city requires consensus and keeping the number of awards small and that that is what makes it a success and acceptable.  Does he agree that, if there is to be a national honours system, the same two criteria should apply &mdash; that there should be consensus across the political divide and it should be kept to a small number of persons &mdash; to make it respected and worthy?  He is aware that granting the freedom of the city of Dublin is something which is handled with delicacy and only given on rare occasions.  A similar approach needs to be adopted with the honours system and I hope the Taoiseach agrees with that sentiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with how narrow the system should be but it seems there are many who do a great deal of work for the country, be they officials, sports people or people involved in agricultural, business or cultural activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the file from a historical perspective to see what happened on previous occasions, the honours system was always compared with one in another jurisdiction.  On at least six occasions when it was examined between 1930 <Col N="72" /> and 1960, Taoisigh said it sounded like a good idea and that the analysis was excellent but that it was the wrong time to introduce it.  Each time they were looking at the honours system of another jurisdiction and that is why they avoided it, and this included five former Taoisigh.</P>
    <P>Without pre-empting anything, we should attempt to find an Irish system which would reflect the unique nature of our society.  If that can be done collectively, a good system could be introduced which would recognise the contribution of people over the years.</P>

      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach said and I await his letter.  To facilitate its drafting, I inform him that the Labour Party is opposed to anything remotely close to the British honours system which is royal and monarchical and an extension of the court of privilege and patronage. If the Taoiseach is thinking of an Oireachtas system of honours along the lines of the system of allocation and decision making which prevails in Dublin City Council of which he was and Deputy Mitchell and I are members, I would be open to its consideration.  We are strongly of the republican tradition that there be no scent or sense of it being conveyed on a family.  As the Taoiseach will know from having read the file, opposition to an honours system in the past arose out of the sense that it conveyed some kind of quasi-aristocratic benediction on the recipient.  However, we have now come of age and can examine it with the self-confidence of the time.  I await the letter from the Taoiseach which I trust will be in tune with what I have articulated.</P>

      <P>However, I still believe we should examine some system of reward.  Many republics have honours systems, some of which fall within the confines of what he outlined and others which do not.  If we make an effort, it must be possible for us to find a system which has a unique Irish flavour to it, despite the fact that 68 years and ten attempts have failed to achieve that result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I attended the launch of the ITIC document, <i>Strategy for Growth Beyond 2000,</i> on 25 May 1998. The study is a welcome and timely contribution to the consultation process initiated on the basis of my own Department's paper entitled A Strategy for Tourism Development, 2000-2006, which is now under way between my Department, State tourism agencies and the industry.</P>
      <P>The ITIC study provides an industry perspective on the continued development of tourism and is particularly timely in the context of future EU Structural Funding.  The study highlights the potential for further growth in Irish tourism, based on an examination of global markets, changes in consumer preferences etc.  It makes recommendations <i>inter alia</i> regarding future funding requirements, training and institutional arrangements.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has been preparing a draft business plan for tourism marketing, 1998-2003, which will be published in the near future.  Obviously, given the different perspectives involved, there are differences in emphasis in the planning documents prepared by my Department, ITIC and Bord Fáilte which will have to be teased out in the coming weeks.  However, a common thread running through all three documents is the need to maintain high investment levels in the key areas of product development, marketing and training if the industry is to sustain its momentum.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of the current consultation process is to develop a shared vision for the development of tourism into the new millennium. Over the coming weeks, discussions will focus on key issues, including those emerging from the aforementioned documents, such as funding arrangements post-1999, destination marketing, training and institutional arrangements.  The discussions will make a significant contribution to the creation of a clear vision for the future of Irish tourism which will inform my Department's input in the autumn into the preparations by the Department of Finance of a new national development plan.</P>

How does the Minister propose to deal with the future financial investment in tourism? Does he believe that Bord Fáilte is equipped to deal with these challenges and issues which are the responsibility of a number of Departments? Has he discussed the document with Bord Fáilte? Has he met the board since the publication of the document and discussed his and the board's response to a document which sets out major challenges for Government and Bord Fáilte? <Col N="74" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The three parties involved are Bord Fáilte, the Department and the industry. These parties have been in continuous contact since the publication of their respective strategies. I have a strategy document which has not yet been published but which is being discussed in the industry.  Bord Fáilte is the facilitator between the industry and the consumer.  It is a public service management board which must try to effectively manage the relationship between the different interdependent and independent areas which comprise the industry.  I would like to see the day when we could implement the excellent AD Little report in full.  I am moving towards that objective.  I would like the industry to take more control of tourism.  If the industry is prepared to contribute economically and in an advisory capacity and carry its share of the burden, I am prepared to offload to it many of the policy making responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I will answer questions on future investment in tourism.  The industry has to be more conscious of the fact that after 1999 there will be a diminution in the funding available.  We have to ensure that we do not take our foot off the pedal.  From that point of view I maintain that all sectors of the industry &mdash; traveller, tailor, soldier, sailor, doctor, sergeant, candlestick maker, are benefiting from tourism.  If there are 7,000,000 in the country then one is bound to be able to achieve this.  If enough people are interested the industry itself should come forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Amateur Swimming Association (IASA) was given a copy of the report of the Murphy inquiry on 17 June 1998 and was requested to give it urgent and immediate consideration.  I have had no discussions since with the association which provided me with its executive council's initial response on Monday, 22 June.  This response includes the executive council's proposed strategy for implementation of the report's recommendations.  I have indicated in my subsequent reply to the association that I shall consider the issue of funding as soon as it has completed its proposed consultations with its wider membership who must be satisfied as to the adequacy of procedures and arrangements in place in their organisation to secure a safe environment for their younger members.</P>
      <P>The vast bulk of the recommendations in the report relate to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.  The only recommendation of specific relevance to my Department concerns the issue of public funding.  The inquiry report recommends that increased public funding be allocated through the Sports Council to the association for necessary reorganisation and training.  In any future consideration of funding, I shall be taking on board Dr. Murphy's recommendation and seeking reprioritisation by the association of its expenditure in favour of reorganisation and training as proposed in the inquiry's report.</P>
      <P>Although the report makes no specific reference to the Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in Ireland, I have written to Dr. Breda McLeavey, Chairperson of the expert committee which drew up the code, and asked her to reconvene the committee to review its contents in the light of the report.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Sports Council, in conjunction with the National Coaching and Training Centre, has begun planning a seminar for later this year for the national governing bodies of sport.  The purpose is to ensure the widest dissemination among sports organisations of the inquiry's recommendations; the outcome of the review of the code of ethics; the findings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee and, most of all, to once again underline the importance of ensuring the protection of their younger members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reaffirmation of this point which is in line with what was discussed at the committee.  I am sure the Minister is aware the Irish Amateur Swimming Association has stated publicly it intends to implement all the recommendations of the report. I am disappointed that because of its current structure it will be some time before it can give a response that will satisfy the Minister or the public. In the interim, will the Minister consider setting up contingency plans to fund élite swimmers <Col N="76" /> about whom we are all concerned?  Does he consider the Sports Council is the appropriate vehicle through which to fund those swimmers, pending a proper response from the IASA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also disturbed that while the Minister is waiting for proposals from the Irish Amateur Swimming Association our prominent athletes are suffering because of a lack of funding to prepare for international events.  Will he explain why, in a year when there is such controversy about the IASA, he decided to bring the Irish Schools Swimming Association under the umbrella of the IASA and thereby deprive it of funding.  The Irish Schools Swimming Association has a separate structure and officers and up to now was funded separately.  The Minister has lumped it in with the IASA at a time when there is a major question mark over that body.  Will he immediately reverse that silly decision and grant funding to the Irish Schools Swimming Association which had no hand, act or part in the current tragic controversy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Mr. McDaid Mr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding will not be provided for any swimming association until there has been a root and branch change within the organisation. It is not enough for an executive council of the IASA to tick off the recommendations in the Murphy Report one by one and think the job is done.  There is a tremendous future for swimming. The Government has given a commitment to provide a 50 metre pool and more money is available for swimming.  As I stated previously, organisations are made up of individual members. There is no point in the IASA telling me one group is thinking of setting up with another organisation, that another group is already in place and making recommendations to me and that others have left the association.  I want a single body dealing with the sport of swimming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <P>The Government and the Department will fund only one credible organisation that will administer the sport and be answerable to FIFA.</P>
      <P>In the past most funding was spent on élite athletes competing in international competitions and that is where most of the abuse took place.  The Deputy said that young athletes are suffering.  I recently heard a recording on an answering machine in the IASA which stated that it was not able to man the telephone because the Minister would not give it funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The public is also of that frame of mind, but I asked the Minister to consider putting in place a structure pending the tidying up of the association.  There are decent people in the IASA, including the director of swimming who has outlined to me the structure he hopes to put in place.  Will the Minister use his ingenuity and set up contingency plans to assist those whom he believes should be assisted?  These people are currently cut off because the IASA was the only body through which funding from the Minister's Department could be channelled to swimmers. Members of the public want swimming assisted, but they also want to ensure the safety of children who get involved in the sport.</P>

Does he agree it has a separate constitution and officers and that it organises swimming at primary and secondary school level.  How could he logically lump the two organisations together when there is a question mark over the IASA?  Will he reconsider that shortsighted and foolish decision and restore funding to the Irish Schools Swimming Association so it can organise its programmes for next September?  Why did the Minister force those organisations together in a year of controversy over the IASA?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Ferris, I am anxious to bring together those involved, but this has been blown out of all proportion.  I understand the IASA will contact its branch members in July and that we will probably have a degree of unanimity by September.  However, when confidence has been restored in the association, I will not hesitate to provide funding retrospectively. The members who left for personal reasons, those who have been expelled and the honest decent members must come forward with their proposals so that we can restore confidence in the organisation. Until that happens, I will not be moved on this issue.  The organisation must be all-inclusive. I do not want separate groups developing in the organisation.  Separate groups will not be funded; the organisation must be united.</P>
      <P>I have already answered Deputy Allen in regard to the Irish Schools Swimming Association. It was decided that it would be better for swimming in schools if that organisation were funded from within the swimming association. This is the way it will be done in the future.  From my reading of the Murphy report the schools were getting very little funding.</P>

      <P>As I announced on Monday evening, 22 June, I have been informed by the chairman of the independent management board for product development of his board's decision to award a grant of approximately £25 million under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-9, to the tender submitted by Spencer Dock International Convention Centre Ltd., for the development of a national conference centre at Spencer Dock adjacent to Dublin's International Financial Services Centre.  The board's decision followed the submission by Bord Fáilte of the report of the team of expert evaluators which examined each of the five tenders.  The total estimated cost of the conference centre being proposed is in the region of £80 million.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that a tender was selected following the competition run by Bord Fáilte on behalf of the management board.  The decision of the management board is subject to Government and EU agreement on foot of a cost benefit analysis which has been commissioned and is under way.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the chairman, Mr. Malachy Stephens, and the board for successfully bringing the process to this stage, having regard to the requirement of the Commission that a sufficient level of progress be achieved to ensure the project can be completed under the current round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>This flagship project is seen by Government as an extremely important addition to our tourism infrastructure.  It will further enhance the tourism industry's efforts to exploit the full potential of the international conference market.  It is estimated that the new centre when developed could generate an additional £30 million per annum in foreign tourism revenue, much of it outside the high season which is a matter of great significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the decision announced by the Minister on Monday subsequent to this question being tabled on Thursday.  Is he happy the schedule set out will be met in order that the Structural Funds can be drawn down before the deadline?  In view of the figures he gave regarding business which will be generated mainly in the Dublin area, will he consider setting up regional convention centres to tap into the vast potential which exists in relation to international conferences? Will he develop this policy as a means of redressing the imbalance in the growth of tourism <Col N="79" /> on the east coast as against the patchy growth in the rest of the country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>An answer to a later question deals with the last two questions raised by the Deputy regarding the regional imbalance.  In the context of the schedule, we are ahead of the EU deadline.  There is a CSF monitoring committee meeting on Thursday.  This time we have dotted the &ldquo;i&rdquo;s and crossed the &ldquo;t&rdquo;s.  I admit that past experience, including that of Deputy Kenny and his predecessor, has been of benefit.  I thank the product management board and its chairman, Mr. Malachy Stephens, who have been dealing with the matter over the full period.  Many other management boards would have given up the ghost a long time ago but this board persisted.  We had difficulties but I am delighted we have an excellent project and hope it will benefit not only Dublin people, but people nationally.</P>
      <P>Construction will involve up to 1,000 jobs.  Part of the remit of the docklands development authority is that a certain percentage of the jobs must be from the local area.  The project will be a catalyst to the development of the docklands area.  It will bring high incentive tourism business to Dublin and prove an incentive for the entire country.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider allocating a portion of the additional £2 million from the INTERREG II community initiatives fund towards funding community driven projects in Border counties, particularly given that the Bord Fáilte projects fund has no money.</Quest>

      <P>The Minister for Finance has overall responsibility for the Northern Ireland-Ireland INTERREG programme.  However, I understand the monitoring committee for the Northern Ireland-Ireland INTERREG programme yesterday approved an additional allocation of 0.6 million ecu, approximately £480,000, for the tourism measure as part of a number of financial reallocations within the INTERREG programme.  These financial reallocations are subject to a formal EU Commission decision before funds can flow.  This will be a welcome boost for the tourism measure as the bulk of the funding originally made available in 1994 for Bord Fáilte assessed tourism projects has been allocated.  I hope the additional funds will attract a mix of community and private sector based tourism projects in line with the objectives of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to any community group to make an application through the Department of Finance for INTERREG funding.  However, the level of demand for grant assistance to date has been such that only the very strongest projects have received support.  Furthermore, the European Commission has reminded all working groups <Col N="80" /> under the programme of the need to have a clear and strong cross-Border dimension in projects to be funded from these additional resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Peace is imminent, something which is very welcome.  While welcoming the £408,000, it is insufficient owing to the number of programmes which have been activated.  Will the Minister state how community initiatives can grow with such development, given that he indicated in his reply that only projects supported by Bord Fáilte and which carry significant weight will be successful?  There are a huge number of projects throughout the Border counties which would definitely be beneficial in the context of tourism growth.  We have had 30 years of violence and £408,000 is only a pittance.  We need £4 million, given the number of projects brought to my attention.  Will the Minister seriously examine increasing the funding from Bord Fáilte or other sources?</P>
      <P>Regarding the role of the Department of Finance, Bord Fáilte is the governing body for tourism and should have a major say in the allocation of funding, particularly in the context of Border counties during this very important time of tourism growth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  An amount of £2 million had to be reallocated and we received 25 per cent of it.  I would have gladly accept the entire amount.  In the context of this week's vote in Northern Ireland and the peace process, the Border region has potential in the tourism area which never previously existed.</P>
      <P>In the past some people have not been shy about coming forward.  For example, of the £13.6 million which was previously allocated, £10 million was received on the southern side of the Border. At that time projects to a cost of £40 million were submitted.  This is a usual situation.  Twenty-four capital product projects were approved and 18 marketing projects were approved, giving a total of 42 projects.  However, 140 projects sought funding.  Unfortunately, the money is not available, but I take the Deputy's views on board, namely, that any extra funding would be gratefully accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Finance is the Department with overall responsibility for co-ordinating Ireland's preparations for the changeover to the euro, encompassing preparations by the Irish public administration and helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover.</P>
      <P>A number of initiatives in connection with the changeover have already been put in place, including: the establishment of the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI, on 5 May this year, to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover and to provide public and consumer information; the launch of an £800,000 national information programme run by the ECBI, designed in phases to provide information on the changeover to euro as the single currency project proceeds; the making available by the ECBI of a sum of £200,000 to assist non-governmental organisations meet the cost of approved activities to promote awareness of the euro among the public; and, a special business awareness campaign run by Forfás at a cost of £400,000 which aims to provide businesses with the information they need to prepare themselves for EMU and the changeover to euro.</P>
      <P>While funding has been made available for an awareness campaign to inform business and the public of what is involved in the euro changeover, the Government, in line with the intentions of the other ten countries in the euro 11, has no plan to provide special help for businesses generally to make the changeover.  It should be borne in mind in this context that EMU should bring significant benefits to businesses.  Interest rates should, in general, be lower within EMU than if Ireland were not a member.  Exchange rate uncertainty will be eliminated for trade, tourism and investment among the member states participating in EMU.  Furthermore, the single currency will mean the need for currency conversion will no longer arise within the euro area.  These benefits will be ongoing while, of their nature, changeover costs will be once-off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed with the Minister's reply.  Hotels and guesthouses are very vulnerable particularly given the nature <Col N="82" /> of Irish tourism and climatic conditions.  Many family run hotels are barely ticking over and the changeover to the euro will entail a good deal of expenditure on their behalf.  Surely there is some avenue the Minister could explore which would provide funding towards this beleaguered sector of the tourism industry.  The sector is already in competition with seaside resort and urban renewal schemes and is receiving no assistance whatsoever.  If assistance is not provided, small hotels and guesthouses will find it almost impossible to carry on.  The euro changeover will be the straw which will break the camel's back.  Small hotels and guesthouses are the backbone of the industry and it is a dismal reflection on the Minister if he cannot provide assistance to them.</P>

      <P>On whether the Government will provide assistance in this area, the answer is a categorical no. If people go into business, they must be prepared to pay the price.  The Deputy's question is akin to saying that if the price of bed linen were extraordinarily expensive in one area in comparison with another, the Government should step in to subsidise costs.  That is not what is involved in business.</P>

    <P>I want more private sector involvement in the funding of the tourism industry.  The industry is developing rapidly and we cannot afford to <Col N="83" /> decelerate it.

      <P>Bord Fáilte, out of moneys provided from my Vote, and Dublin Tourism, is providing a total of £15,000 this year to the tourist victim support service, TVSS, which represents almost 50 per cent of its income.</P>
      <P>I am aware the TVSS has recently called again on private sector tourism interests to make a much more substantial financial contribution to it.  With a very few notable exceptions, that contribution has been negligible up to now and, earlier this year, in a formal message of support, I urged the broad tourism industry to provide a worthwhile level of financial assistance.  I understand that Bord Fáilte also independently undertook a campaign to elicit more funding from the industry.</P>
      <P>As on previous occasions, I applaud the TVSS for its very valuable work, which it undertakes with substantial voluntary effort.  It is high time the industry came forward with an appropriate level of assistance, especially in the context of the present tourism boom.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept it is a very serious feature of Irish tourism that a service such as the TVSS even exists?  If our image as a friendly, hospitable nation is not to be seriously damaged, we must ensure that, as far as possible, tourists are safe but that if they are subjected to criminal activity of any kind, they will be fully supported.  Does the Minister accept that regardless of what he has done until now, his pleas to the commercial sector have simply not worked? At a point when the TVSS is experiencing a serious shortfall, will the Minister clearly state his intention to put some muscle behind his statements? He will bring his own reputation into a certain amount of disrepute if he cannot ensure <Col N="84" /> statements he makes elicit a positive response from the commercial sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>One would naturally wish to appeal to the private sector to come forward in the first instance but I assure the Deputy I will exert some pressure on them to do so.  However, I cannot force people to pay up.  I agree with what the Deputy said about this area.  Last year this group approached me and I increased our contribution to it from £10,000 to £15,000.  That increased contribution will be made this year.</P>
      <P>Lest the impression go out from this House that tourists are not safe here I will outline a few statistics to clarify the position.  Ireland is still a safe tourist destination and rates very well by any international comparison.  That was borne out in a survey carried out for <i>Which</i> magazine which shows that Ireland has the fourth lowest level of theft rate of the 44 countries surveyed and only 0.6 per cent of those who took part in the survey reported being victims of theft.  The level of crime must be seen in the context of the growth of tourism. Official figures for 1996 show there was a total of 4,024 crimes against tourists, but that figure represents less than 0.1 per cent of total tourist numbers.  That figure includes petty crime, theft from parked cars, etc., and there were only 43 cases of tourists who sustained personal injuries. Only 13 per cent of referrals to the TVSS were muggings and the largest category, more than 50 per cent, involved pick-pocketing.  Unfortunately, 89 per cent of crime against tourists occurs in Dublin and much of it is drug related and part of the overall crime problem, while the rest of the country is relatively trouble free.  I would not like the impression to go from this House that we need to allocate a good deal of money to aid this group, although more money needs to be allocated to it.  This country is an exceptionally safe, crime free area as regards the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>We should try to ensure this country is as crime free as possible, but there are still some victims in the area.  As the Minister knows, there is a shortfall in the funding for this voluntary organisation which is doing extremely good work.  The Minister said he would use his muscle and he is in a position to use it in regard to the commercial sector which is making a fortune out of tourism.  Will he outline precisely what he intends to do to go that step beyond appealing to the better nature of the commercial sector?  What muscle does he intend to use to ensure that the tourist victim support organisation can continue to provide an invaluable service and, sadly, one we will have to ensure is provided for the future, regardless of the level of crime rate in this area?  I accept the crime level in this area is relatively low, but it is a serious matter for tourists.  We should not disregard the personal hurt, damage and distress caused to people who are subject to criminal attack when visiting another country. <Col N="85" /></P>

      <P>I do not want to compel anybody to do anything.  These issues are being discussed with the private tourism sector.  We may feel compelled to deal with some issues and that is how I am approaching this matter.</P>
      <P>The victim support group was set up in 1994 and direct financial aid is not given to victims although benefit in kind is provided.  We can be proud that the tourist victim support group exists and in Europe it is recognised that we look after our tourists.  However, when there is a horrible mugging of a tourist, regardless of the part of the country in which it occurs, it tends to get reported in our newspapers.  That is what we must face, although there are very few crimes in this area. The crime rate in this area is very low and we are working to improve the future funding of the TVSS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 32, 40 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>Following a tender process, a mid-term evaluation of the URBAN Operational Programme was commissioned by the programme's monitoring committee on 30 April 1998.  A draft evaluation has been recently submitted to my Department, as lead Department for the programme. This draft is being examined to ensure that it meets the terms of reference following which it will be considered by the monitoring committee for the programme which will report, with recommendations if appropriate, to the CSF Monitoring Committee.  This will complete the mid-term review process.  Once the programme's monitoring committee has completed its consideration of the evaluation, which is likely to be at its autumn meeting, the evaluation will be available through the CSF evaluation unit in the Department of Finance.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="87" /> In so far as funding is concerned, approximately £10 million is being made available to the north Dublin URBAN area, which includes Ballymun, Darndale and Finglas, and £5 million each to the south Dublin URBAN area, which includes Tallaght and Clondalkin, and the north side of Cork city URBAN area.  To date north Dublin has drawn down £2.2 million and south Dublin and north Cork city have drawn down £1.4 million each.  Funding is drawn down on the basis of developed projects in line with strategies formulated under action plans.  Once projects comply with the relevant criteria and Department of Finance approval has been obtained, there will be no delay in my Department releasing funds.</P>

      <P>This programme relates to urban areas, essentially those I outlined which have particular difficulties.  It was established in 1996 on the basis of particular criteria and will run to 1999, but what will be in place thereafter is another issue.  Other programmes cover rural areas.  I am involved in the partnership area and there are a number of partnerships spread across the country, other specialist organisations and national groups, as well as the Leader group, for which my ministerial colleague, Deputy Davern is responsible.  There are other groups which seek to tackle deprivation and other neglected rural areas, but this programme applies only to the areas to which I referred.  There have not been any changes to expand the areas covered by it.  It is another matter as to whether a case could be made for expanding it post-1999.</P>

      <P>This programme was introduced by the former Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell. Is the current Minister of State, Deputy Flood, concerned that two years after the establishment of the programme little money has been drawn down? Is he further concerned that the cost of projects proposed in different areas might now have escalated due to increased building costs?  Many of the objectives and plans are being smothered by bureaucracy and red tape.  The figures presented by the Minister of State show&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the low amounts of money allocated, will the Minister of State do everything possible to ensure that credible projects in deprived areas are not smothered by bureaucracy and red tape as appears to be the case to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department, as the lead Department for this programme, is keen to ensure that resources are given to the community for which they are allocated.  That is an important issue.  It is a three year programme and nothing in the Department delays the drawing down of funds by the respective steering groups.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1997, 55 per cent of the available funding was committed to specific projects.  There is now a definite acceleration in drawing down further funds.  Up to 11 July 1997, a total of £400,000 was drawn down by the three areas.  The programme was transferred to my Department on the change of Government and from 11 July 1997 to the end of the year, £1,700,000 was drawn down.  Up to June 1998, a further £2,900,000 was drawn down.</P>
      <P>I accept that steering groups must be put in place and develop their plans.  Some of the spending is allocated to projects, the development of which can involve time consuming processes such as planning permission, establishing management structures and dealing with other issues which are intrinsic to setting up a good, properly managed project.  These considerations should not be seen as delaying measures but as the establishment of proper and appropriate structures to allow the appropriate moneys to be drawn down and to facilitate accountability.  Capital works projects obviously take time but the draw down of funding is accelerating and there is no delay in assisting this process in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>These funds are directed to the most disadvantaged areas and I am concerned that most of the money earmarked for this project in April 1996 has not been drawn down even though the needs and disadvantage still exist.  Has <Col N="89" /> the level of consultation required seriously affected the implementation of some of these programmes?  I accept that the Minister of State has responsibility to the Exchequer for the correct allocation of the funding but the consultation process is over-bureaucratic in an area in which there is serious social disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most important that communities and other organisations involved in the work of the steering group are consulted.  Previous experience shows that local communities can take the view that certain projects and services were imposed on them with little consultation.  The effort to reverse that approach under the URBAN scheme is welcome.  Local communities must be consulted.  However, I accept the thrust of the comments by Deputies Ferris and Allen.  It is important that projects or facilities promoted under the URBAN programme should be drafted as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>An external mid-term review is being carried out and my office received a draft report on 4 June.  If lessons are to be learned from the review, which will be finalised in the autumn when it will be sent to the appropriate committee, about mechanisms to expedite the draw down of funds by the steering group, the Department will intervene and arrange for them to be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not seek to apportion political blame in this matter but will the Minister of State concede that the allocation of just £1.4 million to the northside of Cork City and of £1.4 million to an area of Dublin out of a total allocation of £5.4 million to each area is unacceptable and unsatisfactory? Bureaucracy and constraints must be removed to enable local groups to proceed as quickly as possible and to avoid their being affected by the escalating costs that are a reality of life.  Will the Minister of State give an assurance that these barriers to progress in deprived areas will be removed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister of State replies, I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputy Perry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also deprived areas in rural parts of the country.  Will the Minister of State consider allocating some of the funds to those areas given that such a small amount has been drawn down at this stage?  The trend of population growth for the year 2006 shows that we must plan ahead, particularly for larger rural centres.  A rural renewal tax incentive scheme has been introduced but some of the URBAN fund might encourage people to invest in rural areas since they will be the more heavily populated areas in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much merit in the approach advocated by Deputy Perry.  However, I do not have the power to extend the boundaries of the URBAN scheme.  Perhaps there will be a different <Col N="90" /> situation after 1999 but, at present, I cannot interfere with the current parameters.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen referred to barriers.  If there are such barriers I will try to remove them in so far as I have the power to so do.  However, the locally based steering groups have an important role in this regard.  They have the right to bring forward projects under the criteria laid down at the outset. The criteria are clear and must be adhered to.</P>
      <P>The steering group can draw down the money on the basis of formulated action plans consistent with the objectives of the programme and develop projects which are in line with strategies outlined in the action plans.  The groups must arrange for the projects to become incorporated as limited companies and sign operation agreements with the lead Department.  The operation agreements have been signed so there is no delay in that case.  It is up to the local steering committees and they have not given me any indication that they have a problem in this area.</P>
      <P>Although it might appear that a small amount has been drawn down by these two areas, neither area will lose out.  All the funding committed to them will be available.  The figures for 1998 show a considerable acceleration in the draw-down of funds and I expect that to continue.  When the process is reviewed at the end of the year significant progress will probably have been made in that regard.</P>
      <P>I accept the points made by the Deputies.  If any difficulties become apparent, I will ensure they are removed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have facilitated the bid by Special Olympics Ireland to host the Special Olympics World Games in 2003 by securing Government approval for grant assistance up to a maximum £5 million towards the cost of implementing the bid should it be successful. During the recent visit of the bid site selection team I hosted two important functions which gave the team an opportunity to assess the enthusiasm of the business community for the games and to be assured of the Government's support for the bid.  The decision on the awarding of the games rests entirely with the board of Special Olympics International.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Special Olympics Ireland, especially given the success of last weekend's functions which highlighted the true meaning of sport.  Did the bid site selection team request further information and, if so, has it been supplied?  What efforts has the Minister made to secure additional private funding for this prestigious <Col N="91" /> event which I hope we will be successful in attracting to Ireland in 2003?</P>

      <P>The Special Olympics Games will be the largest sporting event in the world in 2003 and would be the biggest international sporting event ever to be held in this country.  Over 160 countries will participate in 19 sports involving 7,000 athletes and coaches who will be accompanied by 28,000 family members and friends and assisted by 30,000 volunteers.  We cannot give any commitments, however, until the bid has been successful.  I express my sincere thanks to Telecom Éireann, Guardian PMPA and Toyota Ireland which have pledged their support. The committee, which I have met on a number of occasions, including yesterday, has expressed concern about traffic problems, accommodation, access to swimming pool facilities and funding.  I was able to reassure it that we would be able to overcome the traffic congestion problem with the help of the Garda Síochána and that progress has been made in recent months on a number of swimming pool projects.  If the bid is successful, we will do everything possible to raise the necessary funding to hold this special event.  Our wonderful country has acquired a reputation throughout Europe for its people and landscape.  I would also like us to be ahead of the field when it comes to being disability friendly.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister in his efforts to attract this event to Ireland and pay tribute to Deputy Spring who, when Minister for Foreign Affairs in the previous Administration, established the working group which has brought us to the stage where we are a leading contender along with Argentina.  Is it the case that the bid site selection team highlighted two major issues, the transportation of athletes and officials and the availability of a 50-metre pool?  Is the Minister satisfied that we will be able to overcome these problems and will be successful in attracting this event to Ireland?  I had the privilege to attend the event when it was held in Connecticut.  It was a memorable occasion.  When will a decision be made on a 50-metre pool?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The main events, with perhaps the exception of swimming, would be held in and around Dublin.  Athletes prefer to be based in one location.  Belfast was mentioned but this would entail a journey of 45 minutes.  This would create difficulties.  Some 160 towns and villages would, however, be given an opportunity to play host to the athletes of a particular country in the <Col N="92" /> week preceding the games.  In this way the benefits would be spread throughout the country.  As Deputy Allen said, Ireland and Argentina are the two countries vying for the games.</P>
      <P>The bid site selection team highlighted the transportation issue.  In response I indicated the exceptionally successful measures which we have taken.  For the games all that would be required is an eight lane, 25-metre pool.  The Government is committed to providing a 50-metre pool in respect of which nine proposals are being considered and contact documents issued.  I hope to have some news before the end of the year.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I am appalled and outraged that the Government has decided against the provision of unpaid leave for parents of children under eight years and is confining it to parents of children under five years.  Was this decided at the drop of a hat?  How come it did not decide on a figure of three and a half years or two and a half years?  It is scandalous.  The Government is one of the few uncaring members in the European Union.  The other member states have decided on a figure of eight years.  As usual, only lip service is given to the welfare of our children by this Government.  It decided to give the minimal basic rights.</P>
      <P>I have here a letter written by a low-paid civil servant with two children aged six and eight years.  Her husband is also in a low-paid and insecure job.  The person has been working for the last 20 years and has an impeccable record in terms of attendance.  She could not be described as a layabout.  In all those years she has never had enough free time to give adequate time to her children.  They have been dragged from babysitter to babysitter.  They have been sick at times and unable to cope, but had to make do with the situation. Sometimes it was necessary to lumber grandparents with the children.  This woman, in common with many parents, was looking forward to spending time with her children this and next year considering that one of them is aged six.  She was granted maternity leave when the children were babies for which she is more than grateful. However, if her children turn out to be delinquents, she will lay the blame fairly and squarely on the Government's shoulders because of its hypocritical attitude towards children.  She concludes by stating:</P>
      <P>I am keeping a copy of this letter to show to my children in later life so they will have no illusions about Government policies.  We will breed another generation of cynics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is only one example of a deluge of letters <Col N="94" /> that I and the other spokespersons have received. We have received a torrent of correspondence from people who waited in anticipation for this measure.  They hoped that when the EU directive eventually found its way into law, it would provide the type of relief, sustenance and free time for them to spend with their children.  Unfortunately, their hopes have been dashed.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not primarily about parents but children. It is not essentially about parents' rights but children's rights to the care and nurturing of their parents in their homes.  It is about children's rights to a childhood with their parents.  The Constitution is the underpinning proof positive of our nation's commitment to the family, recognising it as the &ldquo;fundamental unit&rdquo; and as &ldquo;a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.  It recognises the family as &ldquo;indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State&rdquo;.  Article 41.2.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>On 15 May last, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, launched with considerable fanfare another manifestation of a commitment to the family, the final report of the Commission on the Family.  The report is strong on analysis and recommendations.  However, within three weeks of its publication, the Parental Leave Bill, 1998, appeared and was greeted with justified disappointment and criticism.  As the correspondence I outlined stated, the measure was long anticipated. There was a sense of expectation that the long overdue measure would be put in place immediately, that it would be flexible and introduce a practical regime which would enable scope for working mothers and fathers to participate in their primary role of parenting.</P>
    <P>In hindsight, perhaps it should have been obvious that what eventually appeared would not, by a long shot, meet the expectations of many parents.  The Bill's place on the legislative ladder can be gauged by the fact that Ireland failed to meet the EU deadline of 3 June.  If it had not been for the ominous scales of Brussels or the prospect of being hauled by Irish citizens before the European courts, there is little doubt that the measure would not have seen the light of day.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's comments, the approach is recognised as grudgingly minimalist.  The decision not to enshrine any provision for payment for parental leave has given rise to considerable controversy.  This is particularly the case given that the Commission on the Family report sets down three suggested options &mdash; a parent allowance, PRSI-funded extended parental leave up to three months or a special rate of child benefit for all children up to three years of age.  The decision to allow only parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996 to qualify for the new parental <Col N="95" /> leave is further evidence of a reluctance on the part of the Government to embrace the spirit behind the EU directive.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to comprehend why it is not possible to extend retrospectively parental leave to 1994 to enable the maximum number of parents to qualify.  The EU directive allows member states to permit parents of children up to eight years of age to avail of the leave, yet the Government has decided to restrict it to parents of children up to the age of five.  This is difficult to understand, particularly given that no payment is involved and elaborate provision is made for advance notification, for liaison with and approval of employers in order to minimise disruption of employment patterns and productivity.</P>
    <P>This curtailment in permitting only parents of children up to the age of five years to take parental leave is another indication of the Government's tardy acknowledgment of our internationally imposed obligations to parents and children.  It is difficult to understand, particularly given that no payment provision is made, why it is not possible to avail of the maximum time scope as provided for and recommended by the EU directive.</P>
    <P>In 1993, only three countries in Europe had no parental leave scheme, Ireland, Britain and Sweden.  By 1998 only Ireland had not fulfilled its obligations in this regard.  It is worth putting our minimalist approach in context.  The Swedish scheme entitles mothers, or fathers if they wish, to a year's career break following maternity leave with the option of taking the leave as two years' part-time work instead.  Germany offers 18 months' parental leave after maternity leave with a low flat rate payment for six months and a variable payment depending on the family income for the final 12 months.  Italian mothers receive six months' parental leave at 30 per cent of earnings on top of their five month maternity leave.</P>
    <P>In these countries women's working and mothering lives have become built into their socio-economic culture.  In Ireland, however, many women feel forced to return to full-time work or to family unfriendly work through lack of choice. Most EU countries, in addition to the three I mentioned, have managed to find positive ways of combining family and work.  Unfortunately, however, Ireland has taken onto itself the self-centred individualism which has characterised other countries for many years.  As a result, we are less child-centred than was previously the case.</P>
    <P>The concept of the rights of each partner has moved centre stage.  Our rights to individual fulfilment are taking priority over what should be our lovingly accepted duty to ensure as parents that our children's rights and fulfilment are what really count.  As a society there is the ever constant assertion of and emphasis on rights and entitlements without any sense of reciprocal or correlative duties attached to such rights.  If society is to regain a healthy and balanced attitude <Col N="96" /> and approach, it must revert to the old altruistic principle of &ldquo;others have rights, I have duties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>To assert children's rights in such strident terms and to emphasise parental selfishness sometimes offends political correctness.  To allege that a growing number of parents are putting their happiness before their children's interests is to run the gauntlet of being condemned by what can be labelled as the &ldquo;progressives&rdquo; in society. However, parents will have to reappraise their perceived right to unbridled self-realisation.  It is time we grappled with the issues parenthood raises and the responsibilities it imposes, which go right to the roots of society.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, there has been a major change in the pattern of parenting in the past 30 years.  A small number of households had both parents working 30 years ago, and few children had two unemployed parents.  By 1991, 50,000 families with children under five years had both parents working.  The Minister has given us the figure for women in the workforce, but the relevant issue here is the number of families with children and both parents working.  Job-sharing was introduced as a novel experiment to enable one or other parent to stay at home with small children and is still with us, but it is conceded on a relatively small scale with a fair amount of resistance from employers, not least in the public sector.  The number of families with both parents working has risen dramatically.  I have given the 1991 figure, and the 1996 census indicates that 128,523 family units had children up to 14 years old and both parents working, which is a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>There is a crucial need to get the correct balance of rights.  For far too long the balance has been weighted in favour of parents' rights.  If we are to get society back on an even keel, we must shift the balance back in favour of our children, and the State must play an active supporting role. The December budget distributed the largesse of the Celtic tiger, and when the percentages were stripped away it managed to bring child benefit for the first two children to a total of £7 each per week.  Only Spain makes worse social provision for its children than we do.  France, Germany and the Scandinavian countries leave us blushing with their comparative financial commitment to their children.  Examining the various welfare benefits of the different countries, we fare well compared to most of the social welfare benefits, but we fall far behind in the area of child support.  One need only look at the income tax code: there are personal allowances for mortgages, PAYE allowances and health insurance allowance, but there is no tax free allowance for children if one is married.</P>
    <P>We, as parents, must come to grips with the difficulties of modern childhood and child rearing. Peer pressure on children who do not get proper parental guidance, encouragement or psychological support from balanced parents is impossible to withstand.  The pressure to conform <Col N="97" /> to what is socially and morally wrong but which is universally accepted by a child's friends is overwhelming. The daily onslaught on standards from the appalling violence on cable television and videos and the warped view of life pushed by popular cable channels are all constantly thwarting attempts to define values and to uphold decent standards in society.  The failure of parents to set moral guidelines or establish limits, whether through selfishness, indifference or the fear of being tainted as conservative, is not fair to the child, who is crying out for limits to be defined and enforced.  Children are big losers and society is the ultimate loser.</P>
    <P>A survey published in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently indicated that three out of four women see their primary motherhood role as providing for their families.  However, the degree to which society facilitates this is fast disappearing.  To buy a modest semi-detached house in any of our cities or large towns will cost a couple approximately £90,000, with repayments of £750 per month.  This must be found before electricity, food, clothing, footwear, telephone and car repayments can be made.  There is no option; both partners must work to pay the mortgage and to keep body and soul together.  The primary financial preoccupation is to get enough money each week to survive.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more and more difficult in such a situation to afford children the central role to which they are entitled and which they need. Economic compulsion is eating into the child's entitlement to parental time.  Such economic compulsion dictates the age at which children enter primary school.  The mandatory age is six, yet the vast majority of children go to primary school as soon as is permissible when they reach four.  It has been pointed out that children enter primary school earlier here than in virtually any other country in the world.  I accept that this country has a tradition of children entering primary education earlier than in other countries, but the element of choice has been removed because of the economic compulsion which dictates that most parents must work to sustain a relatively modest lifestyle.  The old allegation that a second wage was for a second car and continental holiday is now redundant.</P>
    <P>Women working in the home reacted angrily to the publication of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, which was understandable.  They were angry that the commission, having examined the diversity of work done, the perceived low status of women in the home, their dependent role, taxation and social welfare, decided against payment for mothers who stayed at home to rear their children.  The report stated: &ldquo;In essence, the homemaker, although of benefit to society, is primarily a private benefit to the earning partner, and as such could hardly be deemed to warrant a State payment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Society must acknowledge the role of women in the workplace and their right to work.  Disincentives <Col N="98" /> to women joining the workforce must be removed.  However, society must value the role of the mother in the home equally.  This value was tangibly demonstrated in monetary terms in a survey some years ago when insurance companies estimated that to replace the work of the mother in the home would cost from £300 to £400 per week.  That was five years ago, and one could add at least £150 per week to that figure now.</P>
    <P>The need for society to look at the urgency of family support measures is crucial.  I agree that it is extremely difficult to turn back the clock. Economic compulsion has made it very difficult in many cases for the second parent to stay at home and engage in full time parenting.  In some cases a mother finds the seclusion and isolation of the house difficult to cope with and welcomes the opportunity to work.  For this reason job-sharing and properly structured part-time work is ideal.  There is an onus on the Government to mediate and to facilitate in situations where there is resistance to such flexibility.  We must inject an acceptance of job sharing and part-time employment into our business culture.  We must put the family centre stage and get our priorities right.</P>
    <P>I will be tabling a series of amendments on Committee Stage in relation to availing of the maximum amount of time off as envisaged by the spirit of the EU directive.  I hope the Minister will see his way to dispensing with some of the in flexibility and rigidity which characterises a measure so many parents pinned their hopes on for so long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill, because parental leave is both pro family and pro society.  I will be seeking to have the Bill amended in a number of crucial areas, but it is important that parental leave is being introduced. In order to fulfil the terms of the directive we should have introduced it on 3 June.  While the Minister has indicated that there was no requirement to look for a deferral, nevertheless to fail to bring it in on the date envisaged in the directive did require serious reasons.  I do not accept that there were serious reasons for not bringing in this legislation in time to have it fully implemented by 3 June.  We were well aware that it was coming up.  It is extremely unfortunate that we are being asked to wait until 3 December.  I ask the Minister to look at bringing it in sooner.  If it passes through both Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess, I see no reason for waiting until 3 December to implement it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has been eloquent in describing reactions since the terms of this Bill were published. Mothers and fathers were awaiting the implementation of the directive and had very definite plans for themselves in terms of spending more time with their children.  They have been disappointed that the Bill is not as wide-ranging as they hoped and particularly disappointed that parental leave will be unpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people who have opposed this legislation have described it as part of a raft of EU-inspired <Col N="99" /> measures which they contend threatens the competitiveness of our economy.  I disagree with this view.  If we are to have a balanced, sane and family-friendly society, it is essential to incorporate provisions in legislation that allow the nurturers of the next generation the opportunity to balance their workplace responsibilities with their family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The first time I had the opportunity to vote was in 1972 when I exercised my franchise in favour of joining the EU.  When I made that decision I would have been in a minority among people who voted on the left of the political spectrum at that time.  Looking back, I think I made a very wise and mature decision.  Despite the fact that the EU is primarily an economic entity, it has initiated a range of measures that have required a balance between the interests of employers and the interests of workers which has been very positive and which would not have come about without broad agreement among member states.  Without this consensus the employers' lobby would have been too strong.  The argument about the need to be competitive would have held sway.</P>
    <P>We have implemented quite a wide variety of these measures, and we are competitive.  It is crucial that so many of these measures have come in agreement among EU member states.  In effect, that has taken away the argument about competitiveness within Europe because we are all on a level playing pitch.  I have no doubt that if we were not in the EU many of these measures would not have been implemented and the fear of losing competitiveness and of people's jobs being threatened would have held sway.  I very much welcome the fact that we have been able to bring in so much legislation that has originated in the EU which has protected workers and potential workers in this country.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in 1972 one of the main arguments people on the left who were opposed to entry to the EU used was that we would lose our neutrality.  That argument is still being put forward in the context of the recent referenda.  However, 26 years later, we are still neutral.  Our economy is good.  Unemployment is consistently falling, at least in the recent past, and we have gained a huge level of self-confidence in our ability to compete with other nations on an economic and trade front.  The worst route we could have gone down for our people would have been a low wage, unprotected working environment. The route we have taken has been one of educating our people so that we can compete as educated people with skills to offer.  That route was very wisely taken.  It is a route that perhaps we would not have been able to take in the way we did if we had not been able to protect workers along the way.  Economies in the East where that route was not taken have not necessarily been protected in the broad economic competitive world.  We should be proud of the route we have taken.</P>
    <P>Measures such as maternity leave, unfair dismissals <Col N="100" /> legislation, equal pay, protection for young and part-time workers etc., have been absorbed and incorporated in the workplace economy, and we are not falling behind competitively as a result.  The reality of more and more parents combining career with family is here to stay and we must facilitate it.  There is no point in pretending it is not a reality.  There is no point in saying we can go back to a situation where there was always an adult, usually female, to step in in a family crisis and take full responsibility for rearing children in those crucial early years.  Four out of ten people in the workplace are women, and nearly two thirds of women in the 25 to 42 age group where the main child rearing is done are in the workforce outside the home.  This is a reality we must deal with.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to ensure the flexibility that enables parents, men or women, to spend time at home with their young children.  It is crucial that where women or men stay at home to mind their children they have the opportunity to get back into the workforce, that we have more opportunities for flexible employment and that we bring in measures like parental leave which is meaningful and allows people to take it up.</P>
    <P>This Bill addresses family responsibilities primarily in two aspects.  One is the right to take leave following the birth or adoption of a child, particularly as that right applies to fathers for the first time.  The other is the issue of <i>force majeure</i> leave where there is a family crisis due to injury or illness.  I cannot fathom why some people say this is not a necessary measure.  I was amazed at some comments I heard, particularly from Senator Quinn in the Seanad who described it as a disastrous proposal.  The most important thing any of us can do is to do the best job we can in helping our children to develop their personalities on a base of security and self-worth.  Fathers as well as mothers have that responsibility and that right.  We have denied it to them for far too long.  The very idea that we should criticise putting into legislation the right of parents to take time off work when there is a serious family crisis is amazing.  It is one aspect of the Bill on which I congratulate the Minister.  The suggestion that workers will treat <i>force majeure</i> leave as an extension of sick leave is insulting to workers.  It will bring great relief to thousands of conscientious parent workers who currently have to pretend they are sick when their child is sick and needs their undivided attention.  Contrary to what has been said, this measure will allow people to be honest with their employers and doctors.  I do not believe it will be abused.  Any GP will say that parents coming into surgery with a sick child often pretend they too are sick because that is the only way they can get time off work.  That is wrong.  It is particularly wrong that parents have to do that in front of their children to get permission to stay off work.  It is correct that we will now allow parents to be up front and say that it is their child who has the problem.  I would like to know why the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; is used in the <Col N="101" /> Bill &mdash; I understand the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is used in the directive.</P>
    <P>Parental leave that allows fathers to spend significant time with their babies has been available in many of our neighbouring European countries for many years.  I had a conversation last week with a 26 year old Swedish postgraduate student of political science.  She told me that when she was born 26 years ago her father took paternity leave.  The Swedish and other Northern European economies, where they have had paternity leave for quite some time, have not fallen apart.  This young woman's experience was that the opportunity for bonding in the early months of her life made spending time with her a priority for her father throughout her childhood.  Parental leave is not so much about taking turns to change nappies and get up during the night &mdash; although that too could be crucial in maintaining a relationship at times &mdash; as about giving parents that space to concentrate on the young developing life for which they are uniquely responsible.</P>
    <P>As a society we are bombarded with demands on our time and have become so stressed that we need to make provision for issues that should have priority.  This is not so much about Government as about social attitudes, but Governments can inform and direct social attitude by ensuring that the law facilitates and underpins social and parental responsibility.  In this context we must inform parents of their rights and ensure there is an educational element to this measure in terms of informing the public.</P>
    <P>I have some problems with the legislation but, on a positive note, I welcome the amendments made in the Seanad including those in relation to the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and the proposal on multiple births which was of particular interest to Senator Kathleen O'Meara, who is one of triplets.  Parents of twins and triplets have mentioned this proposal to me.  I welcome also the Minister's amendment on the question of not having to give advance notice of <i>force majeure</i> leave.</P>
    <P>A proposal was put forward in the Seanad on giving the forthcoming Equality Authority a role in terms of information on parental leave.  The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, stated in the Seanad that she would examine that proposal. Will consideration be given to it on Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reassurance in his contribution this morning on social welfare and PRSI contributions and the fact that people's records will be maintained.  That matter was raised with me by trade union interests.  They were concerned about the possibility of continuing superannuation contributions so that people would not lose out.  Perhaps the Minister will convey his intentions in that respect.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that I would like the Minister to consider introducing this measure before 3 December.  I am disappointed the legislation will only apply to children born after June 1996 i.e. after the directive was first adopted, the <Col N="102" /> reason being that people might be able to back-date claims.  I would have thought a simple clause inserted in the Bill would safeguard against that. Will the Minister examine that aspect again because many parents with children under five who were born before June 1996 have contacted us to say they will be unable to take advantage of parental leave?  That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed the legislation does not cover children up to the age of eight.  I know that was not obligatory but it was the age used in the wording of the directive.  It will not add significant cost to extend the legislation to cover children up to the age of eight.  Many parents have said they would like to avail of parental leave and spend more time with their children during the early primary school years.</P>
    <P>That parents who take parental leave will not be paid will create an even bigger divide between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; in our society because people on low pay, who do not have much disposable income, will be unable to take parental leave.  That is extremely disappointing. The Minister should give further consideration to that aspect, even at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins said the report of the Commission on the Family recommended paid parental leave.  That section of the report states:</P>
    <P>The Commission considers that, if parental leave in line with the EU Directive is to provide practical assistance to parents who wish to have the opportunity to spend time with their young child, the issue of paid leave or compensation for loss of earnings must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Commission has stated in Chapter 5 that providing direct support to parents at a time when the childcare responsibilities are at their most demanding, and initiatives to facilitate parents in taking time out of the paid workforce if this is their preferred choice in relation to the care of their young children, are priority considerations in formulating future policy in support of families with their childcare responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Commission agrees with the view put forward to it in a submission that unless the period of parental leave is paid it will not fully realise key family objectives which include providing real opportunities to mothers and fathers in balancing their work and family responsibilities, promoting equality for working parents in the workplace and in the home in the sharing of childcare responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It is the Commission's view that the introduction of a statutory right to paid parental leave would be an important first step towards these family objectives.</P>
    <P>The Commission would urge that consideration should be given to an extension of the PRSI maternity benefit scheme to cover parental leave with the payment of a weekly benefit to the parent availing of parental leave.  This would meet the need for basic income security during the period of leave for parents who are likely to avail of the option.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> This measure was costed at £40 million per annum.  That is a sizeable sum but, as Senator Henry stated in the Seanad, the economic consequences to the country of bad parenting may well be a much larger sum than the cost of paying for parental leave.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement is directly related to a person's income.  If there were some adaptation of the family income supplement, which is means tested, it would exclude parents earning high incomes who can afford to take time off work without pay but would include the people who simply cannot afford to take parental leave.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that worthwhile suggestion in conjunction with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  It is not an option I have heard discussed before but it is one that might be adaptable to the concept of parental leave.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins detailed the provisions in various EU states, the majority of which pay for parental leave out of their social insurance funds. That seems to be the standard method.  I accept there should not be an onus on employers in that they should not have to pay for parental leave. That would not be practical in terms of balancing the books.  The onus should be on the State rather than on the employer and that seems to be norm in most EU countries.</P>
    <P>In an appendix to Chapter 8 of the report of the Commission on the Family, the full details of payments in various European countries are outlined including individual rights, the payments, where the money comes from and the percentage take-up.  It is interesting to note that the countries in which there is a high take-up are those which offer a reasonably good payment.  The highest take-up is in Sweden with 90 per cent of women and 78 per cent of men taking up parental leave. That is interesting because in Germany, only 1 per cent of men take up parental leave although the leave is much more restricted in Germany than in the Scandinavian countries.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the part of the Explanatory Memorandum which states that the introduction of parental leave will not affect Ireland's competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other EU member states given that most of the existing parental leave schemes are more generous than that in the Bill. I am sure that makes ICTU and other employers feel good but it is not something of which we should be particularly proud.  We should be as generous as other EU countries because we must balance the social benefit of allowing parents to stay at home with young children against the economic aspects of such a measure.  Countries which offer generous parental leave do not appear to have a problem in regard to competitiveness. That must be taken into account also.</P>
    <P>I accept there are cultural aspects to a measure such as this.  It probably is the case that Irish men will be fairly slow to take up parental leave, particularly if it is unpaid, but it should be an important issue for fathers.  I feel sorry for men <Col N="104" /> who in the past were put in the position where their children were told: &ldquo;Wait till your father gets home&rdquo; or, as in the words of the song, &ldquo;if you're not asleep when the boozers close you'll get a belt from your da&rdquo;.  It was unacceptable to be put into that kind of role and fathers are no longer willing to accept that.  Many fathers would welcome a balance in roles in terms of earning money and being directly involved in parenting in the home.</P>
    <P>I do not know if many people watched &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo;, the adaptation of John McGahern's book, or read the book, which eloquently describes the dilemma of the traditional Irish father who found it difficult to show tenderness and seemed to lay the heavy hand when he wanted to extend the warm hand.  That is a tradition which most men would like to leave behind and we should assist them in that.</P>
    <P>The culture in countries such as Sweden is totally different.  An article written some time ago by the Prime Minister of Sweden states:</P>
    <P>The truth is, we can no longer afford to be patriarchal, to be sexist, and to discriminate.  In order to make economic progress, we need social progress.  The work, the creativity, and the decision-making capacity of women are desperately needed in order to make Swedish business and society competitive.</P>
    <P>This doesn't answer the question &ldquo;why?&rdquo; some may object.  Yes it does.  A mere change in the traditional roles and patterns of women means stopping half way.  Merely breaking down the barriers faced by women on the labour market and in public life is not enough.</P>
    <P>The next breakthrough is a change in men.</P>
    <P>That indicates a different way of looking at matters. It indicates that the economic activity of women is needed in order to bring out the best in the economy.  Similarly, male parental involvement is needed in order to best fulfil the social role of families.  There is a need for cultural as well as legislative change.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency carried out research on how flexibility in the workplace can be positive rather than negative in terms of its impact on employers.  It states:</P>
    <P>Surveys carried out indicate that people employed under a more flexible arrangement have less absenteeism, sick leave, and higher productivity for the proportion of hours worked.</P>
    <P>Many small businesses in Ireland are already accommodating their employees' personal circumstances.</P>
    <P>This &lsquo;personal touch&rsquo; has yielded high dividends in the local community with positive responses to the employer and the business. For bigger organisations a more formal arrangement is required.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of this matter is that if employees' needs are met, employees will work <Col N="105" /> harder than if the employer is heavy-handed and does not understand their needs.</P>
    <P>We should see this measure as an opportunity rather than a burden.  Research carried out by the Commission on the Family indicates that in some countries parental leave and other such measures are considered as a way of tackling unemployment because work is divided among more people.  With flexible hours, part-time work and parents taking time off to be at home with their families, there is need for more people in the workplace.  That has positive results in terms of unemployment figures.  Parental leave should, therefore, be considered as a positive measure from the point of view of the economy and it should be taken on board.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins said, there are huge economic pressures on parents to earn money.  It is often not from personal choice that both parents of young children go out to work.  Ideally they should have the option of spending time at home, and this legislation gives them that option.  The Bill, however, does not go far enough in terms of the main areas I have outlined, particularly in that no pay will be given for parental leave.  That will rule out many people who would love to spend time at home with their children in their formative years but cannot afford to do so.  Will the Minister consider the option I suggested as a way of providing payment for parents who most need it.  The provision regarding the upper age limit is extremely disappointing and I also ask the Minister to consider that.</P>
    <P>A three year review has been promised, but we should not have to wait three years to have these measures incorporated in the legislation.  It behoves us to incorporate the spirit of the directive in the legislation we implement, particularly at a time of economic progress when we are relatively well off compared with other European countries.  Everyone will admit there is a growing divide between people who are not doing well out of the economy and people who are doing well. If we do not bring in family-friendly measures that have positive social consequences at a time of economic prosperity, it will be much more difficult to bring them in when there is not as much money in the economy.  We should be as generous as possible in legislation such as this.  If we do not bring in measures such as parental leave so that parents can spend time at home with their children, whether it be <i>force majeure</i> leave where there is a particularly urgent problem or in the formative years when it is crucial that children have a positive and strong feeling about themselves, we are failing our children and future generations. While I very much welcome the introduction of parental leave, it should have been introduced in a broader and more generous fashion.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill.  Under the terms of Partnership 2000 the Government promised that this legislation would be introduced by June 1998 and we are on target with that.  The <Col N="106" /> legislation complies with the terms of existing EU directives in this field.  Impetus was given to this legislation by the needs of the increasingly large number of female employees in Europe &mdash; in this country alone the figure is just less than 500,000 or 46 per cent of the working population.</P>
      <P>I note from the Bill there will be expense involved in administration.  Costs will be incurred by either of the two ministries concerned, the ministries for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which will recoup their expenses from the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives legal effect to a practice which has obtained in many firms for a long time. Employers may have many assets, they may own a business, property, plant and machinery, but enlightened employers have always realised that their most valuable asset is the goodwill of their workforce, without which they could not function effectively.  In the past such employers allowed for staff rights and concessions which were not written into the working conditions.  Among those was the right to parental and compassionate leave, which was granted on request by some employers as a token of the goodwill between employer and employee.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, not all employers had the same perception of leave on humanitarian grounds. Some would have seen the absence of staff on any grounds as a cost to the business.  They would see an empty work station as loss-making.  Many did not realise employees had a home life outside the workplace.  That thinking has no place in the Ireland of today.  That is why Bills of this nature are being enshrined in law.  The provisions of the Bill must be passed under current EU regulations. It is right that it should become law, even in the absence of such directives.  I would like to think this Bill would have been passed in any event.  We have come a long way from the work practices of the Victorian era and the Dublin of the lockout in the early part of this century.  The employer of today knows his business returns are not dictated solely by market forces and are equally dependent on the goodwill, commitment, and dedication of staff and a will to succeed &mdash; essentially ingredients for a successful business.</P>
      <P>The Bill is well thought out, although some Members of the Opposition may disagree.  Since I have come to the House I have learned that the role of the Opposition is to take a different view to legislation put forward by the Government.  I am sure the Government does likewise when it comes to Private Members' Bills.  The scope of the leave allowed will be greatly expanded.  Part I deals with the standards provisions and ensures the terms of the Bill are binding on all parties concerned.  It gives discretion in the case of more favourable existing terms.  It states that the Bill comes into force on 13 December 1998.  Part II lays out the full entitlements in relation to unpaid parental leave and the mechanism used to ensure its implementation, which is very important for employers and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III deals with the protection of employment <Col N="107" /> rights and ensures the granting of such leave does not have any adverse effect on the employee.  Part IV refers to the procedures to be used in the event of a disagreement between employer and employee in the interpretation of the terms of the Bill.  Members of the Defence Forces are excluded from the terms of this provision because they already have a redress system.</P>
    <P>Part V, which is important, gives priority to the provision of compensation due to an employee in the event of a company ceasing to trade for any reason.  It protects the rights of employees unfairly dismissed while on parental leave and defines the methods of recording parental leave, which is vital.  It contains a clause ensuring a review of the terms of the Act within two to three years &mdash; indeed, not later than three years.</P>
    <P>Long before this Bill was drafted, a form of compassionate leave was the custom in many companies, as was parental leave in response to some circumstances.  This practice was in line with the thought behind the <i>force majeure</i> leave.  <i>Force majeure</i> leave covers the need for limited paid time off in the event of a family crisis involving illness or injury.  It is limited to three days per annum or a total of five days in three years and will be granted to an employee who must care for a sick family member.  Its terms embrace the immediate family of the employee and would include brothers, sisters, parents and grandparents.</P>
    <P>Notice of intent to avail of this leave, as stated in the Bill, must be given in advance, if possible. If not, it should be given in writing as soon as it is practical after the leave has been taken by the employee.  The notice must state the reasons that necessitated the absence from work.</P>
    <P>I am sure there will be differences of opinion and interpretation in the early states of the enactment of the terms of this Bill.  This is inevitable and all new legislation has teething problems.  I am glad this has been comprehensively addressed in section 4 and I congratulate the Minister who has included a section in relation to a rights commissioner who may initially adjudicate on any point in dispute between employer and employee. Failure to resolve differences will automatically involve reference to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  There is provision for further appeal. The tribunal may refer points of law arising in the dispute for determination by the High Court.  The Minister has covered every conceivable aspect in this section.  This mechanism will ensure the protection of an employee's right to parental leave and will involve the payment of compensation in certain cases.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that each parent will be entitled to 14 weeks unpaid leave for each child born after 3 June 1996.  I agree with that date because we must start somewhere and I am not sure how far back we can go.  The leave must be availed of before the child is five years old.  There are provisions for flexibility in the case of <Col N="108" /> adopted children.  Parents cannot pool their joint entitlements and a parent taking this leave cannot also avail of his or her partner's period of 14 week should he or she decide not to take it.  The leave may be taken in a manner agreed by both parties to the agreement.</P>
    <P>Parental leave is not paid but perhaps the Minister might leave it open and give the employer an option to pay the employee if they so decide. Every employer has different business circumstances and financial constraints and some may be able to afford to pay the employee depending on the number of employees seeking parental leave.</P>
    <P>It is important to note the leave is reckonable in the context of the rights of an employee.  Each person in the workforce must complete one year's continuous employment before availing of parental leave.  There is an exception where a child may reach the age of five and the employee has not attained a full year's service.  There is provision for <i>pro rata</i> leave in this instance.  Under the terms of the Bill, children are deemed to be one child in cases of multiple births.</P>
    <P>The Bill clearly lays down the terms under which parental leave may be claimed and granted. It is important that those terms are observed by employers and employees to ensure the full and fair implementation of the Bill.  Notice in writing must be given by employees at least six weeks before the period during which such leave is required.  This note must specify the dates during which parental leave is required.  If an employer so requests, an employee must furnish details of the birth or adoption of a child for whom the leave is requested.  An employee must sign a confirmation document four weeks before the date of the commencement of leave.  If there is a need to amend the period specified, this should be done with mutual consent between the employer and the employee.</P>
    <P>Employers rights are also given cognisance in the Bill.  They may postpone the date of the leave period in certain circumstances.  The Minister has struck the right balance in this regard.  If the employer believes taking leave at a certain time may have a substantial adverse effect on business, he may defer the leave.  I see this happening where leave is requested in a business which has clearly defined seasonal peak periods.  There is also a stipulation that an employer may postpone the leave for a reasonable period if a suitable replacement for the applicant is not available and it would be reasonable for an employer to refuse leave in such circumstances.  This could be expected in the case of jobs requiring certain skills.</P>
    <P>An employer must consult the employee and give an acceptable explanation as to the reasons which apply to the postponement of this parental leave.  It is important to note the rights of an employer to defer leave under the relevant section does not apply in instances where a confirmation document has already been signed by both parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> Parental leave is granted on one condition only &mdash; so that the applicant may take care of the child.  It may sound as if I am stating the obvious but it is important this is clearly defined.  It should not be claimed or used for any other than purpose other than to take care of the child.  A refusal to grant this leave must be given in writing and must state the employer's reason for not acceding to the application.  A reason for such a course of action would be that the employer has definite knowledge or reasonable grounds to believe that the parental leave would not be used for the specified purpose.  Employees have the right of reply and the machinery to enable them to disprove such assertions if inaccurate.  Such safeguards are fundamental to the integrity of this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is, as always, a pleasure to speak in favour of the Minister's enlightened legislation.  I am glad the days of employer abuse of the workforce are a thing of the past.  Some 99.9 per cent of employers treat their employees with the respect they deserve.  My father worked 12 hours a day out of necessity and returned home late at night. I recall being told there were no morning breaks in the 1950s or early 1960s in certain types of businesses, and of others who tried to have a cup of tea in the morning, using the billycan.  When the boss came along they kicked over the billycan so that they would not been seen sneaking a cup of tea.  This was long before morning breaks were introduced.</P>
    <P>I have read about the miserable wages paid to people unfortunate enough to have to tolerate those conditions to supplement the family income.  I can imagine the reaction of some of the business magnates of the bad times of the past to the minimum wage of £4.40 per hour which it is proposed to introduce in the next few years.  They would have thought a worker should not be paid this hourly amount for even a month's wages.  It is right and proper that today's society will no longer tolerate those appalling standards.  I am delighted we are moving forward in worker and employer relations.  Most employers now treat workers as partners in their companies because they see the tremendous benefit from having that type of arrangement in place.  One gets the best out of employees if they are treated as partners and allowed to be part of the decision making process and to help to promote the business. There is much to be said for rewarding employees.  I hope more employers will share more of the rewards and the fruits of their work and labours with their employees.  From my own experience, ones gets more commitment from people by doing so.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this enlightening legislation, for which I hope every Member will vote to ensure its smooth passage through the House.  I hope it will become law as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I welcome the fact that the right to parental leave is being <Col N="110" /> enshrined in our legislation.  It is an important feature of modern life on which to have legislation and as such I welcome it.  In doing so I express my deep alarm at the restrictive nature of that right to parental leave.  There is a very simple maxim in all areas of equality legislation, it is the basic rule of thumb that if a right is not universal, it is nothing more than extended privilege.  We need to think about that in relation to this Bill.  In this instance parental leave will be the privilege primarily of those who can afford to do without an income.  Because it is unpaid, what is being provided for here is parental leave for the better off.  This approach appears to contradict flatly the Government policy as stated in An Action Programme for the Millennium:</P>
      <P>We are committed to protecting the family through political, economic, social and other measures which will support the stability of the family.  In particular, we recognise that many families are forced to live in situations of poverty which inhibits them from carrying out their role.  The new family focus by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is designed to make families central to policy-making.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, these admirable sentiments do not extend as far as instituting practical measures that will assist parents as well as focusing on parents on lower incomes.  Instead the approach the Government has adopted in this Bill is in line with other policies it has pursued and which are clearly manifest in the last budget.  At its simplest, it is a policy best described as rewarding the rich while penalising the poor.  Looking at that record one should not be too surprised that we have been presented with a minimalist Bill which does not rock the boat but, at least, we are entitled to expect that it helps to rock the baby.  It does not do this sufficiently.</P>
      <P>Today parenting is being recognised as a crucial factor in the stability of our society.  It is a good thing that there is that realisation and understanding because for so long it was carried out by women in the home who did not have access to power or influence.  Because of that it was taken for granted.  Today there is a great awareness of the importance of good parenting. We need to ensure that awareness is matched by legislation, family supports, training and funding. Yet this Bill is not just conservative, it is inappropriate for the times we live in.</P>
      <P>The economic boom has created unprecedented wealth.  Profits have soared, fortunes are being made, companies enjoy low tax regimes, stable industrial relations, stable wage costs. Those conditions have not happened by themselves. Workers and their trade unions have been central to creating the kind of economic growth that is the envy of Europe.  Workers are entitled to gain from those benefits.  They are entitled to a pay back for their pay restraint, flexibility and contribution in the past.  So far what they have actually got is spiralling house prices and now indications of upward inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> We are living in a society where the social services are not keeping up with our economic growth, where profits are untrammelled while family supports are still under developed.  The Minister cites seven other EU countries that have paid parental leave and dismisses the possibility that Ireland might join these countries.  Many people today would ask why not?  Will we forever depend on the poor mouth to get us through?  I do not believe this approach reflects the way we see ourselves any more.  This new found confidence among Irish people is at total variance to the concept that Ireland is still the poor relation of the EU.</P>
    <P>Young Irish parents know only too well that we are no longer the poor relation.  They have only to look at the property pages to know that there is so much money sloshing around that it is driving house ownership out of their reach.  They are reminded continually that this country is doing very well economically.  They are being reminded yet again by the Government that they will not be sharing fairly in the benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that paid parental leave would be too costly for individual employers and would damage Ireland's competitive position.  He does not say the absence of paid parental leave will be costly in human terms and damaging to the well being of families whom this Government has already dedicated itself to protect.  Neither does he say what the Commission on the Family report states:</P>
    <P>Investment in support of young children and helping their families can pay dividends later in terms of a good positive experience in childhood, assisting parents in rearing their children to be contributing members of society, developing parents of the future and preventing social problems.</P>
    <P>This is a cost to providing family support.  The Commission on the Family proposals add up to a considerable amount of money, £400 million.  The Minister's estimate is £40 million, although I would dispute it.  Deputy O'Sullivan has dealt with this issue in relation to scaling in terms of income.  If we were to truly meet the needs of the Commission on the Family, investment would have to be on such a scale as to require a totally new political approach by the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us not sell parents short by using the financial argument on the debit side only.  The returns to society are considerable in terms of stability and security and in economic growth when families are supported adequately.</P>
    <P>Employers need to be educated as to the benefits of social measures that support families, particularly those on lower incomes.  Employers need to be given a lead from a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who, in his day, was not behind the wall in speaking up for the unborn child when he sought a referendum on the issue of abortion.  When it comes to the born child, somehow he seems incapable of taking a <Col N="112" /> lead.  The Bill exposes the true nature of Government policy towards families.  The fine words in the programme for Government have turned into the weasel words of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We all know and recognise that parental leave is a central issue for families, not just in Ireland, but across Europe.  The profile of the typical worker has been transformed.  Two-income families are becoming the norm.  The steep increase in the number of women in the workforce and the increase in the number of women raising children alone are having a significant influence on political requirements.  That is a fact of modern family life.  It has led to the drawing up of Council Directive 96/34/EC which is the first directive on social and employment matters negotiated between trade unions and employers at EU level.  Recent research shows widespread support for the principle of paid parental leave.  It is only because the directive has forced the Government to introduce the Bill that it has been introduced in the first place.  There was no choice in the matter.  It would probably have liked to have had a further derogation but there would have been such a political storm that it would have had to have performed a U-turn and not for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Government had to introduce a Bill but it is the quality of it that is at issue and that is the subject of the debate.  The Government must take responsibility for the provisions it makes and the changes these can make to people's lives.  In formulating those provisions, the Minister had a clear choice as to the nature and make up of parental leave, its extent, its provisions and whether it was paid or unpaid.  These are all matters of political judgment and the Government must accept full responsibility for the grave shortcomings in the Bill.  The directive was confined to the minimum level acceptable at EU level and it is stated that it is a base line.  It provides a threshold below which no country may fall.  It does not provide a model for countries to adopt, especially those living through spectacular economic growth and which are governed by parties which claim to have a new family focus or, in the hyperbole of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern's, words: &ldquo;a Government committed to adopting a families first approach&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill is most notable for what it is not.  It is not about adopting a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach.  Is it not about having a family focus nor is it about the centrality of the family in policy making.  It is about scraping through our obligations as an EU member state with the minimum cost, the minimum disturbance and the minimum benefit.  It is inadequate in many aspects, whether it is the date of implementation, the age of the child, the timeframe for parents or that the leave is unpaid.  All these are negatives which must be addressed.  It is petty minded, foot dragging and reactionary legislation which is an expression of begrudgery against the hard fought advances made by men and women across Europe who believe in the principle of equality, both in the house and in the <Col N="113" /> workplace, and who insisted this be put on the European agenda.  To add insult to injury, the Bill is also late.</P>
    <P>We should not be surprised.  The character of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has hardened considerably since the Minister took office.  He represents the worst kind of old style thinking in the area of individual rights.  His record on refugees is a case in point. The carefully constructed Refugee Act passed by all parties of the House has been dumped by him. It was progressive and enlightened legislation which recognised our changing role in a modern Europe, our responsibilities and our rights.  The Minister is now busy replacing that with bureaucratic procedures which are leading us backwards instead of forward.</P>
    <P>This Bill is produced by the same kind of mind-set. It belongs to the past and not to today's world.  That is regrettable because we have a tremendous opportunity to help parents and children by way of a parental leave Bill.  It is regrettable parents are being short-changed in this way. I sympathise with the Minister of State with responsibility for equality and law reform as she is in an invidious position.  Equality is her brief and yet the principle of equality is missing from the Bill as parental leave will be unpaid.  The principle of equality has been missing in much of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's actions since taking office.</P>
    <P>The Bill is supposed to assist families and it will assist some of them.  I recognise that it has benefits and I welcome them but only some families will benefit.  If the Bill is passed as it stands, it will ensure inequality is enshrined in law.  If parental leave is unpaid, only those who can afford to do without will be able to afford to take up such leave.  The reality of doing without such income can be realised by examining the situation of many young parents in meeting their housing needs.  I calculate that an average mortgage in the Dublin area costs about £800 per month.  I may be playing with statistics but it is an example of how much money is required and of how out of kilter the proportion of income to mortgage which applies to house buyers has become.  A young couple setting out to buy their first home in which to rear their children require £400 a month each before they can begin to feed or clothe themselves or their children.  How many young couples struggling with a mortgage will be able to take up the option of unpaid parental leave?  They have young families, their incomes will not be as high as those of older people because they are not that long in the workforce and they are buying houses.  How many will realistically be in a position to take up this option?</P>
    <P>The Committee Stage of the Bill is being taken tomorrow which is a short timeframe for the House to consider the many shortcomings of the Bill.  It is being rushed through the House in a manner which will inevitably mean it will be difficult to make major improvements to ensure the <Col N="114" /> Bill meets people's needs.  We will be limited in what amendments we can table because of the central issue of whether leave is paid or unpaid.  I and others will table amendments on Committee Stage because it is vital that the Bill be modified and improved.  There is an onus on the Minister to ensure the best deal for parents is obtained if he is to comply with his Government's policy statement.  Otherwise, we will have a Bill which will not work for the vast majority of families and which will not have much meaning in terms of taking parental leave to parent and care for children &mdash; the central function concerning men, women and children.</P>
    <P>We must ensure balance is provided for couples who are now both working outside the home and who are trying to juggle everything.  I do not envy them that because it is extremely stressful and difficult to take all responsibilities together.  However, the Bill, if amended, will make a considerable difference to the lives of parents who are doing a job willingly and out of love for their children but often despite the conditions in which they find themselves, be they as a result of income limitations or the rigidity and inflexibility of the workplace.  We have the opportunity in the Bill to significantly support parenting and families.  However, the Minister will have to do better than this Bill if we are to make a real difference. I hope on Committee Stage we will see a more positive, open and modern approach to parental leave than is encapsulated in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak and congratulate the Minister on such welcome legislation.  This Bill implements the EU directive on parental leave, the key objectives of which are: the reconciliation of work and family life and the promotion of equal opportunities and treatment between men and women.  The Bill entitles parents to a limited period of leave to take care of young children and gives employees limited leave in times of family crisis.</P>
      <P>This Bill is of great significance, particularly to women in the workforce.  The numbers of working women has dramatically increased in the past 20 years, reaching 488,000 in 1996.  The Government recognises the need to introduce measures in line with the EU directive to facilitate the changes in the structure of the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, parental leave must be taken before the child reaches five years of age but exceptions are made in the case of adopted children.  The employee must have had one year of continuous service in employment, except where the child is reaching the upper age limit.  Parental leave must be taken as a continuous block of 14 weeks or may be spread over a number of periods by agreement with an employer.  The employee and <Col N="115" /> employer must confirm the leave four weeks before it is taken.</P>
    <P>An employer may postpone parental leave for six months if it could have an adverse effect on business.  The employer may refuse to grant leave or terminate it if he believes there are irregularities. The Bill also provides for <i>force majeure</i> leave. This entitles an employee to leave if he or she is urgently needed because of injury or illness of a family member.  This leave is limited to three days per year or five days in three years.</P>
    <P>An employee on parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave will retain all employment rights other than the right to remuneration or pension rights while on such leave.  Even though the leave is unpaid, the employee will continue to accrue service for the purposes of increments, annual leave etc.  The Bill contains provisions to deal with the resolution of disputes about parental leave or <i>force majeure</i> leave.  Disputes, except disputes about dismissals, can be referred by an employee or employer to a rights commissioner. A decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. A rights commissioner may introduce measures to redress certain situations.  These include compensation of up to 20 weeks pay for the employee, granting parental leave at a particular time, extending the upper age limit of the child, postponing the leave because of its negative effects on business or varying or curtailing it because of a change in the circumstances of the employer or employee.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the needs of both employee and employer.  It will give new rights to employees, granting more equality in the workplace and will provide back up systems to employers to deal with the abuse of the system.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to give more parental leave in the case of the birth of twins or in the case of multiple births.  This focuses our minds on the major issue of child care.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure that the Government commits more resources to child care. There is little communication from health authorities when children are born &mdash; usually this only involves a visit by a public health nurse.  Many community organisations, FÁS schemes and the student summer jobs scheme are used to make and maintain contact with families with children, particularly those with twins or multiple births.</P>
    <P>In many situations where both spouses are working there is not the family and community support.  This House is not setting a good example given that we have no creèche facilities. However, child care is the most important of the issues involved.  That is why I am glad this legislation is the first step in showing that we have a pro-family approach and a family friendly policy.</P>
    <P>Each spouse is entitled to 14 weeks parental leave and twice that in the case of twins.  A week's paternity leave could be more important than long periods of extended maternity leave.  One could reduce the parental leave in favour of a <Col N="116" /> paid period of paternity leave.  I also welcome the fact that parental leave is available up to the child reaching five years of age.  Arguments have been made in favour of three and even eight years, but five years is a good balance.  I have also heard objections to the <i>force majeure</i> provisions.  These provisions are not disastrous.  We have heard these arguments before concerning sick leave and disability benefit and I welcome the provisions for times of family crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that paid parental leave would cost £40 million.  I hope he will be able to obtain £40 million for child care as it is a very important issue.  The important time for parents to be with children is the years before they begin formal schooling and this is why I welcome the age of five as the limit specified in the Bill.  It is a reasonable age up to which parental leave can be taken.  Much will depend on flexibility and co-operation between employers and employees. This will be very important to the success of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment that the Bill will be reviewed.  We must ensure there are provisions for reviewing legislation such as this and the Minister has committed himself to such a process.  The Bill also emphasises the role of the father in rearing children and allows working fathers time off to spend with their children. Some small businesses have noted that, through a combination of maternity and parental leave, an important employee could be off work for up to 36 weeks.  Situations such as this can be dealt with by co-operation.  This is a voluntary system and it is not necessary for the 14 weeks to be taken in one block, in fact one does not have to take the full 14 weeks.</P>
    <P>Job sharing is becoming more prevalent and important.  There are situations in which both spouses are working and there are flexible working arrangements for one or both spouse.  In this spirit the Minister might consider provisions for transferring parental leave between parents.</P>
    <P>In time there will be paid parental leave.  In the past we had arguments about not being able to afford maternity leave and benefit.  If we do not have paid parental leave there will be tax credits for child care.  The focus should be on child care and children.  The Minister has stated that such provisions would be very costly at present.</P>
    <P>This is an enlightened Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and look forward to Committee Stage and getting the Bill through the Houses as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill on the basis that it recognises the role of women in the workforce and the equality of both parents in the home and the workforce.  The Bill is part of Fianna Fáil's overall policy to reconcile work and family life.  Our programme for Government sets out three specific measures of value to the family. First, we refocus the tax and welfare system in favour of the family unit.  The second relates to the introduction of parental leave and the third <Col N="117" /> to the promotion of the status of women at work, in business and in the home.  Despite being only one year in office, the Government has made many positive moves.  It has established an expert working group on child care, which is to report next December, and child care provisions increased from £800,000 in 1997 to £2.6 million in 1998.  The budget provided for increased child benefit and family income supplement and, in his budget speech, the Minister for Finance promised to review the possibility of tax relief on child care in his next budget.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, has introduced the early education forum which is considering children from nought to six years and training, recognition and accreditation for Montessori facilities, play schools, crèches and so on.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Parental Leave Bill fits easily into the Government's overall programme. At last we are giving recognition to the dual role of every parent.  All parents have a full time commitment as a parent as well as a full time commitment to the labour force.  This Bill, in conjunction with the Employment Equality Bill, will improve the status of women in the workforce.  The current participation of women in the workforce here runs at approximately 39 per cent, moving towards the European average of 47 per cent, which I anticipate we will reach in the next few years.  It is particularly interesting to note that half the increase in the labour force is due to the employment of married women.  Various reports, including those published by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and the Second Commission on the Status of Women recognise that child care is essential for the equitable participation of women and men in family and working life.</P>
      <P>Parental leave has been introduced in a number of European countries and we are bringing ourselves into line.  The Bill, which grants 14 weeks leave to each parent up to a child's fifth birthday without loss of increments or annual leave, is very positive.  In many countries, fathers have not made significant use of parental leave, with the notable exception of Sweden, where at least part of the leave is non-transferable.  I welcome the section which does not allow one parent transfer leave to the other because most fathers would tend to transfer all or part of their leave to the mothers.  It is important that men play their role in family care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In countries where the leave is unpaid, as will be the case here, it has been found that finance is not the only factor which prevents men from taking up the option.  In Holland studies have shown that the unsupportive workplace culture is more responsible.  Taking leave for family reasons is seen as a less than legitimate reason for men, particularly in companies where success and competition are measured in the workplace.  A study of career breaks in the postal services carried out in Ireland in 1993 showed that men who took career breaks for domestic reasons said it was for study leave.  In introducing this Bill, we need to <Col N="118" /> change the culture of the work environment to encourage both parents to avail of parental leave.</P>
    <P>Another positive move is the <i>force majeure</i> for family crises which will be paid.  I note this will apply particularly to a member of the family, that no age limit applies and that it can be taken at short notice.  As this will be paid, parents will not be reluctant to take the leave.</P>
    <P>The Government's overall pro-family plan is very positive.  However, a number of initiatives still need to be taken and each Minister needs to put pressure on the Minister for Finance.  The population trend in recent years has resulted in half the population being under the age of 30. When half the population was under the age of 25 we invested more money in education.  These are now young married couples with children who are trying to buy houses and we must invest in them.  We should follow up on our commitment to give tax relief for money spent on child care in registered child care facilities while recognising the value of the work done by parents in the home in looking after children.  We must relieve pressure on young couples who have exorbitant mortgages because of the increase in house prices.  We must recognise that the under 30s are the people who are investing in the future of pension holders, who are generating money in the economy, who have created the consumer society and who are making the best contribution to the economy.  The Minister for Finance must take steps in this regard.  I have already outlined a number of measures taken by other Ministers during the lifetime of the Government.  I am pleased the Bill will shortly be taken in committee. This means we will be able to implement the EU Directive which will lead to the reconciliation of work and family life and promote equal opportunities and treatment between men and women in the workforce and in the home.</P>

      <P>When one is transposing an EU directive into law one must consider the Irish position and consult interested parties such as IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to come up with a formula and a Bill that suits the various organisations and the Irish scene.  Some EU directives take longer than others to transpose into Irish law.  This directive was introduced <Col N="119" /> in 1996 and we are transposing it into law now. A directive on health and safety on fishing vessels was introduced in 1993 and was due to be implemented in November 1995.  The EU threatened court action against our Minister in the latter part of last year unless the directive was transposed into law.  I am concerned that it has taken such a long time to transpose that directive into our law and, unfortunately, there have been a number of tragedies on fishing vessels.  Therefore, health and safety on those vessels is vital.  The previous Government introduced the working time directive Bill, but I expressed the belief at that time that, like the UK Government, we could have got a derogation in regard to its implementation. I vividly remember the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, being very much opposed to the working time directive legislation.  They are now in Government and the process of implementation is taking place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the directive and its implementation as a positive step in the right direction.  I have followed the discussion in both Houses and perhaps am at variance with some of the comments which have been made.  It is populist to say that in the context of the working time directive people should be paid for taking leave.  The issue of inequality was raised.  However, people should reflect on what they mean by inequality.  Fifty per cent of the workforce works outside the home and another 50 per cent decide to be housewives and work in the home.  Quantitative surveys have shown that if the latter group was paid for housework wages would be astronomical in the context of the hours worked.  If in the context of this Bill people received enhanced child benefit, enhanced social welfare and were paid by an employer, we would rightly be criticised for introducing a degree of inequality to the system.  Housewives could rightly claim that such people were being victimised by the system.  How many times in the past have we spoken about recognising the role of the housewife in the context of property?  I know it is populist to make statements on radio that they should be paid.  However, if that happened in this situation we would introduce a degree of inequality.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn has been criticised for making what he regarded as very valid comments.  I read what he said and think his comments were sincere. It is very easy to criticise a person who does not seem to be going with the mood of specific legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is desirable because, due to the Celtic tiger and the much improved employment climate, many wives have decided to work outside the home, something which is good.  Many do so out of economic necessity as they must meet mortgage commitments, etc.  The legislation is good as it provides that a person with children up <Col N="120" /> to five years of age who decides he or she needs special leave due to certain circumstances has the freedom of taking 14 weeks.  Regarding the timescale, it is a matter of finding a middle line between provisions in other countries and what we should do.  Senator O'Toole said that even an age limit of three years was acceptable.  However the Bill could have provided for parents of children aged over five years, as the most valuable developmental years for young children are between four and eight years according to psychologists. Provision for parents with children up to eight years of age would not impinge on the Bill or what the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>Section 16 mentions <i>force majeure</i> circumstances and the provision here is very desirable.  I agree with Senator Quinn's comments about people who say they had sick leave coming to them.  He made the point that if legitimacy is given to a sick pay period, it becomes an absolute necessity afterwards.  A classic example concerns the blue flu where gardaí were on sick leave which, I presume, will be recognised for sick pay time.  Senator Quinn was criticised for making the point that in the context of <i>force majeure</i> circumstances, medical evidence should have to be furnished, something with which I agree.  Not so long ago a programme highlighted certain doctors who gave out medical reports without finding out whether a person was sick.  When people put forward a balanced, rational argument such as this they should not be criticised as they are reflecting reality.</P>
    <P>I am concerned by the increasing number of EU directives and the possibility that as a growing and emerging economy we might in time find it difficult to meet some of their demands.  Sometimes we are pitched in with the Scandinavian model, the countries of which appear to have a tremendous advantage over us in the context of the type of welfare system they operate.  In recent times in France and Germany there have been many concerns over the welfare system which was regarded as benign.  Attempts were subsequently made to claw back on provisions because of demands on the respective economies.  It is important EC directives transposed into Irish law are realistic and compatible with our demands. We can aspire to the ideals of other countries, but reality must prevail.</P>
    <P>Leaving to one side the qualifying age of children, be it five or eight years, the provision of 14 weeks leave is good.  The Minister said that, based on the maternity leave system, it would cost £40 million when introduced if people were paid for leave.  I do not know how this figure was arrived at as he said that in Germany, where the provisions extend to the male workforce, only 1 per cent of males took parental leave.  This is very significant as we perceive the Germans as being very progressive.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very welcome step in the right direction and many people will be extremely happy with the provision of parental leave.  Those taking maternity leave often take the optional <Col N="121" /> four weeks in addition to the 14 weeks.  People have said the Bill should be implemented immediately.  However, as in any new legislation, the employer must adapt his system and personnel records.  We must be realistic and allow a period before implementation.  It is not possible to implement legislation the day after it is signed into law.  There must be a period for employers to get used to the provisions of the Bill, put their personnel records in order and implement the provisions accordingly.  For this reason I do not disagree with the provisions of the Bill being implemented in December.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage people said they would put forward amendments.  I was anxious to speak on this issue, although I have enough to speak about in the context of marine issues and I do not want to be at sea when I speak about justice issues.  People will sometimes take the populist approach and preach equality which may lead to inequality for another section of people, namely, housewives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill in which I believe he has struck the correct balance.  I was amazed to read in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently that some trade unions and political parties were calling for paid parental leave.  That would not be feasible; the concept of parental leave is good but we must be realistic about the manner in which it will operate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane referred to Senator Feargal Quinn's comment that if sick leave were to become part of a scheme, people would take it as an accepted right.  That could give rise to a very dangerous situation.  If parental leave were to become an accepted right and be paid for, most parents would take leave just for the sake of taking it, not because they felt the need to bond with their children but to get more money out of the system.  When this legislation is introduced, we must provide an incentive to people who genuinely need or want parental leave.  That is one of the most fundamental aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In his speech, the Minister pointed out that four out of every ten people in employment are female.  Research suggests this figure will rise dramatically in the future.  Many university faculties such as veterinary, medicine, law and teaching, which used to be predominantly male preserves, now have a majority of female students. In ten years' time perhaps all of the professions will be predominantly peopled by females.  That will give rise to a major change in society.  We will probably need to introduce legislation at that stage which would grant parental leave to house husbands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest social difficulty we will face in the coming years will be the fate of young males who will find it difficult to secure employment as most of it will be taken up by females.  I do not intend to be anti-female; statistics suggest that females will dominate many of the professions in the next 15 to 20 years.  If payment were introduced for <Col N="122" /> parental leave, it would convey the wrong impression.  The Minister has hit the right note in this legislation and has achieved the proper balance. In a number of years' time, amendments may be made to it through necessity.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  It is welcome as it is a major step in the right direction for this State and brings Ireland into line with the EU directive on parental leave.  There was some recent criticism in the press that we were among the last countries to adopt this directive.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing the Bill forward in this Dáil term.  It implements the EU directive on parental leave and will give parents an entitlement to leave from work to take care of their young children.  It will also give employees a limited right to time off work for family crises.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed by the statement by Deputy McManus when she spoke on this Bill some time ago.  She said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform went out on a limb in calling for a referendum in regard to unborn children but does not appear to have the same concern for children who are born.  The Minister is an outstanding family man who prides himself on family values.</P>
      <P>The parental leave directive adopted in June 1996 incorporates a framework agreement which was negotiated between the social partners at EU level.  It set the broad parameters for parental leave but left much to the discretion and interpretation of member states.  The directive stipulates a minimum of three months leave for each parent to be taken to care for children up to the age of five years.  This leave is distinct from maternity leave.  The directive provides that the leave should, in principle, be non-transferable between parents.  Employees must be guaranteed a right to return to work and must be protected against dismissal as long as the minimum requirements of the directive are met.  It is left to member states to determine issues such as whether leave is paid or unpaid, what pattern of leave is to be allowed, the maximum age of the child and matters relating to social security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who decry parental leave as useless because it is unpaid should bear a number of factors in mind.  The Bill's provisions represent major improvement and progress on existing conditions by seeking to reconcile workers' occupational and familial obligations.  To suggest, as some have done, that unpaid leave in such circumstances will never be availed of alleges that all parents, or the overwhelming majority of them, give priority to mercenary considerations over parenting and family obligations and commitments. Such an assertion is unfair and unjustified <Col N="123" /> and is an unwarranted indictment of Irish parents.  The overwhelming majority of parents are prepared and willing to make sacrifices and demonstrate that commitment in the interests of their children by their determination to provide care, concern and support for their welfare.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Parental Leave Bill, the Minister stated his Department examined existing schemes in other countries, including EU member states.  However, because of differing social security systems in the various member states and the diversity of parental leave schemes in operation, it was difficult to draw firm conclusions. From examination of the position in other member states, it is difficult to speak of any kind of norm.  In almost every respect, whether it be the upper age limit of a child, the pattern of leave available or the issue of payment, there is much variation between member states.  Domestic legislation dealing with maternity protection and adoptive leave also provided useful precedents but, as maternity and adoptive leave are both based on particular events, the current Bill differs from earlier legislation in many respects.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he is in consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to ensure that time spent on parental leave will be credited for social welfare purposes where it applies.  This means a worker will not lose out on his or her long-term or short-term social welfare benefits because of time spent on parental leave.  The arrangements do not form part of the present measure but will be put in place by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs once the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The parental leave directive, 1996, which follows the course mapped out by the Charter on Social Policy, 1989, sets down minimum requirements for member states.  However, great flexibility is given to each member state to decide on issues such as the maximum age of the child, whether the leave is to be paid and matters relating to social security.  Therefore, the Bill is in full compliance with the terms of the directive.  While the directive leaves the question of paid or unpaid leave to the discretion of each State, it is important to emphasise that the social partners decided on the terms of the framework agreement which imposes no obligation to provide paid leave.  In an ideal world we would all like to have paid leave provided for parents, but those who are most loud in demanding it must state if they believe the taxpayer should foot the Bill, if other areas of public funding should suffer or if the employer should pay.  Such an imposition, even in times of economic boom, would be resisted by employers or, worse, would cause job losses.</P>
    <P>The Bill heralds a major change in working life. It makes it mandatory henceforth for employers to take account of parental and family duties of their employees.  Where this has not happened on a voluntary basis, the implementation of this legislation will herald a significant cultural change <Col N="124" /> for those working parents who will benefit from it.  When the legislation is revisited, as is required, this legislation will be referred to as a significant milestone on the road to equality and support for the family.  I compliment the Minister and his Department on it.</P>
    <P>It is welcome the legislation will be reviewed in three years' time as that will give us a chance to assess whether its provisions are working.  The provisions are not cut in stone.  I am pleased the Government is not fixated on set provisions and that it is prepared to try out provisions and to return to the negotiating table if problems arise with them.  The main aspect of the legislation is the flexibility it allows.  It requires co-operation between employers and employees and workers have a responsibility to respect their place of employment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the provision governing unpaid leave.  Ireland is a small country with a large number of small businesses.  It would be totally impractical and unrealistic to expect employers to pay the salaries of people on parental leave.  That would potentially crucify the economy.  As the Minister stated, in countries where employees are paid for such leave only 1 per cent of parents take it up.  In Ireland mothers on maternity leave often take up their entitlement to unpaid leave. Regardless of whether parental leave is paid or unpaid, people who wish to avail of it will do so in the interests of their children.</P>
    <P>By allowing fathers and mothers to avail of parental leave, the Bill will provide both parents with the opportunity to take an active part in the care and upbringing of their children.  This new leave recognises emergencies occur which can require a parent's absence from work to tend to a sick child or other member of the family.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the role of the father in rearing a family.  It allows fathers, for the first time, to take time off work to spend with their children.  This option will give many fathers a chance they have not had until now and this leave will also give mothers more time.  It is very difficult for parents, particularly mothers, to juggle all their responsibilities at once, such as housekeeping, shopping, helping with homework and fitting in time to have fun with their children.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is of great significance, particularly to women in the workforce. The number of women in the workforce has increased in the past 20 years and reached 488,000 in 1996.  The Government recognises the need to introduce measures in line with the EU directive to facilitate the changes in the structure of the workforce.</P>
    <P>An employee on parental leave will retain all employment rights other than the right to remuneration or pension rights while on such leave.  Even though the leave is unpaid the employee will continue to accrue service for the purpose of increments, annual leave etc.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provisions to deal with the resolution of disputes about parental leave.  Disputes can be referred by an employee or <Col N="125" /> employer to a rights commissioner and a decision of a rights commissioner may be appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  A rights commissioner may introduce measures to redress certain situations.  These include compensation of up to 20 weeks pay for an employee, granting parental leave at a particular time, extending the upper age limit of the child, postponing the leave because of its negative effects on the employment or varying it or curtailing it because of a change in the circumstances of the employer or employee.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses the needs of the employee and the employer.  It will give new rights to employees granting more equality in the workplace and will provide a back-up system to employers by providing measures to deal with abuse of the system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and recognise it will be of major benefit to family life.  Those in favour of paid parental leave must recognise it would pose a major imposition on employers.  The burden they must carry in terms of trying to cover the leave parents will take is heavy, but they are committed to carrying it because they took part in the consultation process which led to this Bill.  While it will be most beneficial for parents and family life, a burden also falls on employers.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and its timely publication.  We have accrued many benefits from Europe, but the directive on foot of which this Bill is being implemented will benefit our young people for many generations to come.  This is a balanced Bill which has been introduced following consultation between representatives of employers and employees.  Neither group will be totally happy with the outcome, but a balanced approach had to be taken and this Bill represents a balanced approach to both sides.</P>
      <P>Psychologists and members of the medical profession will confirm that the most important stage in young people's development is their early childhood.  For that reason alone this Bill is welcome. Not only are there difficulties in society, but members of many families often spend a good deal of time apart because of the necessity for both parents to work to provide for the household. This arrangement will allow parents to take turns to provide for the wellbeing of their child at the very early stages of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency where there is a good deal of social deprivation and a high degree of welfare dependency.  At some stage in the future we should introduce some form of means tests through the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to ensure parents on low income who apply for parental leave will receive some benefit.  Parents on higher incomes will be able to afford to take parental leave. Social studies reveal that children from areas of high unemployment and low income families tend to be the ones most at risk.  I understand the Minister will review this legislation in a numbers of <Col N="126" /> years, but this is an area we will have to consider in the very near future.</P>
    <P>If a mother on low income took leave for the number of weeks allowed under this Bill, that would create major financial constraints and put an increased financial burden on the household. Some people would argue such leave is voluntary, but if this right exists the people who are entitled to avail of it should be able to do so.  The income of parents in low paid employment should be bolstered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to allow them to give as much time and energy to the raising of their child as the parents of a family on a higher income.  That mechanism would allow that to happen and I am conscious that the Minister will review this legislation.</P>
    <P>While some employers would argue the provisions of the Bill are too extreme those on the other side would argue it is minimalist.  I have no major reservations about how it will work when implemented <i>vis-à-vis</i> employers and employees. The Bill is well laid out and there are many provisions to cover that.  If a problem arises it can be referred to a rights commissioner, from there to a tribunal and then to the High Court.  However, as the guidelines are clear there will be little reason for confrontation between employee and employer.</P>
    <P>This legislation will benefit society as well as the individual.  Its purpose is to allow parents to give as much time and energy as possible to raising their offspring at the most delicate stage of their lives.  That will have a positive effect not only on the individual but also on society.</P>
    <P>The Bill also refers to abuse of parental leave. How are its provisions to be enforced?  What monitoring arrangements are in place?  Will the leave be based on trust and goodwill or will inspectors check if employees are involved in child rearing or playing golf?  If widespread abuse takes place early in the period after the Bill is enacted, it might cause difficulty for genuine applicants in securing parental leave.  What procedures are in place to ensure genuine applicants will not have difficulty in securing parental leave?</P>
    <P>The provision for flexibility is a positive step. There must be flexibility for employers, particularly those with seasonal businesses.  If a number of people apply for parental leave at the same time from a company involved in seasonal work, it would be almost impossible for the company to survive.  There must be certain constraints to protect the company and the employer in such a situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for protection of employment rights.  There is always concern that legislation such as this might diminish an employee's entitlements. However, in-depth study of the Bill shows that an employee will qualify for all benefits he or she would accrue had he or she been working for the 14 weeks.  Most importantly, he or she will qualify for social welfare entitlements in the event of losing the job after returning from parental leave.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> The Bill has a balanced approach.  Given the make up of families, the number of women in the workplace and the pressure on families to sustain a household in the current climate of inflated house prices and so forth, people have a fundamental right to take leave from work to look after their children if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding <i>force majeure</i> is also welcome.  Over the years many people lost jobs because, as a result of an accident or an untimely illness, they were unable to take a few essential days leave to look after loved ones.  This is a humanitarian measure which, ultimately, will bring employers and employees closer.  Under this legislation a person has a right, in the event of illness or a tragedy striking a family, to take a few days leave to look after a loved one or to deal with the family's affairs.</P>
    <P>People often argue about the pros and cons of EU directives.  This one, however, should be implemented.  There are companies in which there are good relationships between employers and employees and where the provisions of this legislation have been implemented on a discretionary basis.  Employees in such companies have no trouble applying for leave of absence to look after a family member.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The legislation is a positive step towards ensuring that young people are given a positive start in life.  However, it can be argued that the Bill will not bring immediate benefit to some.  In the long-term, the Minister should consider the provision of funding and a means testing mechanism whereby people on lower incomes will have an equal right to apply for and secure parental leave.  I look forward to the speedy passing of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I always experience a sense of <i>déja vu</i> when legislation is introduced which affects women in the workplace.  Each time a painfully small step is taken in the most modest manner possible.  The threat of wholesale suffering on the part of employers and the destruction of the economy is usually forecast if a modest step of this nature is taken.  It is always taken as a result of our membership of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Listening to Members raise fears about the workplace, employers and the ravages that might result from this small step, one can come to two conclusions.  The first is that it is a miracle any progressive legislation is introduced with regard to work and employment.  The second is that, in the case of this Bill and when maternity leave was introduced, one would think that every employee, male and female, was about to become pregnant and bring the country to a standstill even though biologically and practically that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters must be put in context instead of this constant invocation of the worst possible scenario.  I would like to be a member of a parliament and of a society which one day might, on the introduction of legislation that affects the family and is positive in supporting women and <Col N="128" /> removing the obstacles they face, welcome and support such legislation.  Indeed, such legislation might even go beyond the minimal boundaries behind which we always appear to stay in our laggard approach to meeting our responsibilities in the context of European legislation.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the hysteria that seized this country in 1976 when the spectre of equal pay was visited upon it.  Reluctantly, the then Government sought derogation; Ireland is always a special case.  Women were told there would be no jobs for them if they had the temerity to seek equal pay.  In 1977 employment equality legislation was introduced.  Again, it was forecast that society would collapse.  Women were threatening men's jobs and employers would not be able to provide or adapt facilities so women could enter workplaces traditionally held by men.  There followed years of struggle, delays and derogations to facilitate employment equality.  Surprisingly, women contributed at an extraordinary level and the economy began to grow.</P>
    <P>The next crisis was the introduction of maternity leave in 1980.  Again there was hysteria. Regrettably, maternity leave in Ireland is abysmally short, particularly compared to other countries. Not only is child benefit pitifully small but we do not recognise the importance for the next generation of families rearing children.  There is no positive encouragement to recognise what society and the Constitution believe, that ours should be a family and child centred society. Mothers are entitled to 14 weeks paid leave and four weeks unpaid leave.  Because of the difficulties encountered in breast-feeding and weaning the child and in making suitable child care arrangements many mothers made the ultimate sacrifice and stayed at home.  Others were forced, out of financial necessity, to work outside the home at huge cost to themselves in terms of guilt. There was a lack of adequate child care facilities. By not giving women the same opportunities as men to work outside the home we reneged on the commitment to ensure equality of opportunity about which there was much talk.</P>
    <P>On this occasion we are, once more, doing the very minimum.  Fathers will be entitled to leave but it will be unpaid.  While we have to be aware of the difficulties of employers, we lack the political will to introduce enabling legislation with an eye to the future of society.  It is almost as if the industrial revolution was only beginning.  Thankfully, the workplace is changing.  It was appalling that men as the breadwinners were required to work long hours and were denied the opportunity to bond with their children.  This is reflected in Irish literature by dysfunctional families and the lack of role models for fathers and sons.  While the damage caused by the subservience of family life and relationships to the workplace is being questioned, we are still reluctant to change work practices to make the workplace more family friendly.  This would help to ease some of our other difficulties such as road congestion.  We <Col N="129" /> have failed to show enlightenment and innovative thinking.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the book published to accompany the BBC education series &ldquo;Breaking Glass&rdquo;.  It is stated in the chapter dealing with the workplace of the future:</P>
    <P>In Professor Charles Handy's vision of the future, women and men will move in and out of work, family and education, selling their portfolio of skills and experience to a variety of clients.  They will operate from a portable office supplemented by a regional or local club which will provide technological back-up as well as the opportunity to socialise with and &ldquo;spark off&rdquo; colleagues and friends.</P>
    <P>Intelligence, rather than conventional buildings, systems and hours of work, will be an essential component of this concept.  However, it also means that fashionable rhetoric about valuing people must become a reality.  As Charles Handy says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For a long time now, corporate chairmen have been saying that their real assets were their people, but few really meant it and none went so far as to put these assets on their balance sheet&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Profits and losses, takeovers and mergers are the stuff of balance sheets.  Yet we know that the assets which produce the profits are people but they do not appear on the balance sheet.</P>
    <P>It has been shown in other countries where provision has been made for parental leave with incentives that men need to be kick-started.  In Norway where there are tax and social security incentives for men to take parental leave the take up rate is very low because there is a view that career men should not take time off for parental responsibilities.  It is seen as a disadvantage in terms of career progression.  This mind-set has to change.  What will the take up rate be if leave is unpaid?</P>
    <P>Every person who pays PRSI contributes to the paid maternity fund.  The Minister should consider funding parental leave in this way.  It is a social function, not a selfish luxury on the part of two people, to have children.  France and Germany have discovered to their cost that when parents, women in particular, find the cost of having children too high in terms of work opportunities the birth rate falls to such an extent that there are not enough workers to pay the pensions of people like me.  It, therefore, makes good economic sense not only to encourage couples to have children but also to ensure they receive the required level of support.  This is not the case at present and this Bill will not create that position.</P>
    <P>Given the current state of the economy and the sacrifice skilled trained professional women, who are joining the workforce in greater numbers, must make, they will consider the cost of having children in the future.  They will have to bear the responsibility of the cost of child care to enable them to work or they will be forced, as they are forced now, to leave the workplace despite <Col N="130" /> attaining skills, qualifications and job satisfaction. Aside from family friendly terms, in financial terms the country cannot afford that.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider amendments to the Bill.  I am aware that he wants the legislation enacted as quickly as possible, but Committee Stage will be taken hastily and there may not be time to debate the full depth, breadth and aspirations of the Bill as in more leisurely times. I ask the Minister to take on board the sincere contributions from all sides and to recognise that amendments are necessary to improve and strengthen the legislation.  He should not leave too long a gap before it is reviewed.</P>
    <P>The birth rates in Germany and France fell so dramatically that huge incentives were built into legislation and work practices to allow people to have children.  Large financial benefits are given if parents have a third child.  We should learn from the experience of those countries.  The Minister should consider developments in Europe. Schemes have been successful in Scandinavian countries because incentives are incorporated in them.  Parental leave is paid and firms have been rewarded for encouraging fathers to take such leave.  Government policy is to give special grant funding to them as an encouragement.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the experience of France and Germany where the birth rates dropped because couples felt they could not afford to have children and work.  We should use the advantage of our late development in this area by using that experience and considering the good and bad elements of various schemes.  We should incorporate the good elements in our legislation and avoid making the same mistakes or suffering the same difficulties they experienced.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the development of decent parental legislation in conjunction with all the other supports such as child care and tax allowances for highly qualified paid child care services.  These should be given willingly.  Ireland has thankfully achieved economic growth to an astonishing degree.  I remind the Minister that a recent ESRI report pointed out that one of the reasons for the current state of the economy is the sacrifices made by women who stayed at home.  They sacrificed their careers for the training, education and careers of their children.</P>
    <P>In an age of supposed equality, women should not be asked to continue to make that sacrifice. I am a veteran and I am aware of what women contributed in those years.  I ask the Minister to invest in this legislation and provide the financial resources to ensure that women do not continue to sacrifice their freedom and economic independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is an important measure in improving the quality of life of children.  It is effectively a Bill for children and will enable parents to improve their role in the rearing of their children.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> There has been much social change in the past 20 years and greater involvement by women in employment, which is welcome.  Undoubtedly, the growth of the economy is in no small way due to the involvement of women in employment outside the home.  This change has affected family life.  The old community and family support network which existed in the past has disappeared in urban and rural Ireland.  The same support for the family no longer exists in society.</P>
    <P>The support provided by extended families has also disappeared.  In former times a person had access to their immediate family but also to their grandparents, who often lived nearby, uncles, aunts and cousins.  This support system is absent today and means fewer facilities are available to children to communicate their difficulties, stresses and concerns outside their immediate family.  This aspect has been considered in the context of suicide, a topic which is in the news today.  In previous times young people had immediate access and a close relationship with their cousins, uncles and aunts.  In some instances, they were closer to them than their parents and could communicate some of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Parental Leave Directive, adopted in June 1996, incorporates a framework agreement negotiated between the social partners at EU level. The directive stipulates a minimum of three months leave for each parent to be taken in the initial years of a child's life up to the age of eight. The leave is different from maternity leave and should not be transferred between parents. Employees must be protected against dismissal and guaranteed the right to return to work.  In addition to providing for paternal leave, as provided for in the Bill, the directive also provides that workers must be given leave for family crises resulting from illness and accidents.</P>
    <P>The workplace is moving towards becoming more family friendly.  It is beginning to recognise the role of both parents and the necessity to ensure that the next generation is reared with the influence of both parents who should have the opportunity to transfer their values to their children. At present the workplace is family unfriendly.  One almost has to give notice that one is leaving work to attend to a family crisis such as the illness of a child or difficulties a child may be experiencing.  One must justify oneself for leaving rather than employers accepting that people have to respond to family crises.</P>
    <P>There has been a massive growth in the number of women at work in Ireland over the past 25 years.  In the past 20 years the number of women in the workforce has grown by more than 212,000, reaching a total of 448,000 in 1996.  In 1997, the number of women at work was more than 512,000, or four in every ten workers.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Broadcasting and other Media (Public Right of Access and Diversity of Ownership) Bill, l998: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the spirit of positive thinking behind Deputy Michael D. Higgins's Bill, which is that legislation in respect of Article 3<i>a</i> of the EU Broadcasting Directive would be introduced here to protect various sporting events and that cross-ownership of different media would be limited to less than 25 per cent in cases where ownership was up to 100 per cent in others.</P>
      <P>Regarding sporting events that could be listed for protection, the GAA All-Ireland senior and minor hurling finals in September 1997 attracted a television audience of 495,000 people.  The All-Ireland senior and minor football finals on 28 September 1997 attracted 601,000 viewers.  My county was involved in the latter game but lost. The Jameson Irish Grand National from Fairy-house in March 1997 attracted an audience of 256,000 and the Budweiser Irish Derby from the Curragh attracted an audience of 141,000.  In international soccer, the Republic of Ireland versus Belgium in October 1997 attracted an audience of 727,000, while the friendly game between Wales and Ireland in February 1997 attracted 663,000 viewers.  In the 1994 World Cup, the Irish games against Italy, Mexico, Norway and Holland attracted audiences of 1.466 million, 1.534 million, 1.705 million and 1.512 million viewers.  The FAI Cup Final between Derry City and Shelbourne attracted an audience of more than 250,000, while rugby internationals attract approximately 267,000 viewers.</P>
      <P>It would be encouraging if the Minister, given the complexities and consequences of the introduction of digital television, accepted Deputy Higgins's Bill.  She should accept it in the interests of promotion of diversity, competition and public service.  If her Department does not feel it is up to standard she could amend it on Committee Stage and arrange for the acceptance of Article 3<i>a</i> in respect of sporting events having consulted the public.  She could then amend its provisions regarding cross ownership of the public media. The principle is correct and I support it very strongly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister and other speakers, I welcome the principle of the Bill and I have no difficulty with what Deputy Higgins wants to do.  However, having read the Bill and <Col N="133" /> its Explanatory Memorandum, I am not sure that it is effective in achieving its stated objectives. With respect to whoever drafted it, it is put together slightly crudely and if passed in this form would be open to a variety of challenges.  It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. That is not to say that legislation with these objectives cannot be drafted and passed, as I hope it will.</P>
      <P>In essence this Bill has two sections; the remainder of it is incidental and of no significance. Section 1 purports to implement Article 3<i>a</i> of Council Directive 89/552/EEC and seems to do so simply by quoting the Article, which I do not think is sufficient.</P>
      <P>Section 1(3) seems to assume legislation in all member states to implement the Article when the Article is optional.  If it is decided to implement it, member states may do so by legislation, regulation or administrative action.  It would be impossible to prosecute and convict somebody here of a criminal offence based on something as vague and relatively indefinable as administrative action in another member state.  The approach by way of criminal rather than civil liability may be faulty.  The last line of the subsection refers to legislation only and ignores regulation and administrative action.</P>
      <P>Another difficulty with section 1 is that it makes no attempt to define what a broadcaster operating within the State is as opposed to one established within the State.  Can it be said that the Murdoch empire, and BSkyB particularly, operates within the State?  I think that is very doubtful.  The nature of the Murdoch group's business means it could make it its business to operate from another member state or another country outside the EU.  Effective enforcement on prohibition of exclusivity necessitates refined international co-operation of a kind that is scarcely met in the directives of 1989 or 1997.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not given much guidance in section 1(2) on how to prescribe a list of events which are, in her opinion, of major importance for society.  We are mainly talking here about sporting events; are most sporting events properly described as being of major importance to society?  Society is something broader than avid fans who are intensely interested in a particular sport, and not all sports fans are interested in all sports.</P>
      <P>Apart from the annoyance caused to members of the public who cannot view particular sports events without paying significant sums of money to Mr. Murdoch, the real damage done by Mr. Murdoch is to the sports themselves.  His acquisition of exclusive rights to many of the more important rugby matches throughout the world has had a profound effect on rugby, introducing an era of professionalism that is foreign to the spirit of the game but which is now inevitable and apparently permanent.  I hate to think what would happen if the GAA went down the same road as the rugby unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important but complicated matter, <Col N="134" /> and Deputy Higgins's best efforts do not overcome the complication.  I hope the Minister, together with her colleagues in other Departments, will come up with a solution after full reflection.  They cannot do it on their own and we need enhanced international co-operation, particularly from the EU, to achieve these objectives, which I feel would be shared throughout the EU.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 2, I subscribe to the desirability of proscribing an undue concentration of media ownership.  However, the Bill's approach to this is to extend the application of the concept of abuse of dominant position, which is not necessarily the best or only way.  I used an alternative with some success when I made an Order under section 2(5)(a) of the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, in respect of the ownership and control of newspapers and magazines.  That Act was passed early in July 1978 and a few days after that I made an Order under the section removing the minimum threshold requirements for all takeovers and mergers relating to newspapers and magazines in Ireland. That order remains in force and has achieved its objective.  At the time the order was made, Independent Newspapers owned 16 newspaper titles within the State.  I felt that was enough.</P>
    <P>As Minister I did not consent to their acquiring any further titles.  I believe none of my successors in office so consented either.  Independent Newspapers did partly circumvent my efforts by establishing on, I believe, a 50-50 basis a new newspaper in Ireland called <i>The Star</i>, and they acquired 29.99 per cent of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> which was the maximum they could then acquire without having to obtain the consent of the Minister. They have exercised virtual total control over the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> because, in addition to their shareholding, they have lent large sums of money to that paper which apparently enables them, with the consent of the majority shareholders, to exercise full control.  If I had not made the order in l978, Independent Newspapers would by now probably have acquired control of most newspapers in this country.</P>
    <P>Several approaches were made to me as Minister, and presumably to others also, to allow Independent Newspapers to take over full legal control of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, but I refused each such approach.  Approaches were also made in respect of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  My feeling in regard to that paper was that Independent Newspapers were more interested in acquiring it at or before its closure for the purpose of closing it down and preventing the continuation of a competitor rather than for the purpose of investing money in it and revitalising it.</P>
    <P>I always felt that it was inappropriate and inopportune that Independent Newspapers should have been granted or allowed to acquire the majority of licences for MMDS rebroadcasting and the right to broadcast local television here, because of the substantial proportion of national and local newspapers which they already owned or controlled.  However, they were given a significant <Col N="135" /> number of licences and acquired some further ones so that they now hold, according to recent newspaper reports, 19 of the 29 licences issued for this purpose in Ireland.  This is undesirable, and the question of their being asked to divest themselves of some of these licences should be seriously considered.  In particular, they should not be allowed to acquire any further interest in television in any form here or in local or national radio.</P>
    <P>In considering Independent Newspapers' ownership position, it is necessary for the House and the Minister to bear in mind that this group has been known to use its editorial policy to further its own commercial interests.  It is not necessarily unique in this, but so strong is its grip that I have noticed a reluctance by some in public life or in public positions to voice in public any criticism or indeed even reservations about that dominant position.</P>
    <P>Concentration of media ownership is a problem in a great many countries.  It is no less a problem here even if that fact is not always fully realised.  Section 2 of this Bill, by inserting a new section 5A in the Competition Act, l991, tries to tackle the problem from a different point of view, and there is some merit in approaching it from the aspect of abuse of a dominant position if one is precluded from preventing that dominant position arising by the prohibition of mergers or takeovers, the dominant position having already been achieved.  However, subsection (2), in prohibiting an undertaking that enjoys 25 per cent of one media market acquiring an interest in another undertaking which enjoys 25 per cent or more of the market share of another media market, is not sufficient.  A large variety of companies in the MMDS and cable areas have rights to originating transmission as well as retransmission.  It could be argued that with the exception of Cablelink in Dublin, no one undertaking has 25 per cent of a particular national media market.  Therefore, subsection (2) is virtually toothless.</P>
    <P>I do not follow why section 2 (4)(d) of this Bill lumps in cable and MMDS with satellite and digital television.  These should be retained as separate categories because by putting all four together it is necessary to show that one undertaking has more than 25 per cent of that entire field in the State.  No one has, and probably no one ever will have.</P>
    <P>A more useful approach therefore to the problem of concentration of media ownership which section 2 seeks to tackle may well be the making of another order under section 2 of the l978 Act in relation to broadcasting and retransmission in all its forms allied to an inquiry into a dominant situation, which was previously called a monopoly, by the Competition Authority, the report of which the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment could consider with a view to making a divesting order.</P>
    <P>Any dominant position is dangerous if it is <Col N="136" /> abused.  A dominant position which is not abused at a given point in time can very quickly become abused when its owners see the power they have and want to flex their muscles.  There is very little tradition of compulsory divesting here, but, because of its special sensitivity the concentration of media ownership deserves more attention than any other dominant position or monopoly.  This is especially true in an age where some sections at least of the media can be identified as regularly grinding their own axes or putting their own spin on public events and public affairs in a way that was not known a generation or two ago when its objectivity was assumed and the absence of a private agenda in the media was taken for granted.</P>
    <P>Much as I agree with what the Bill is trying to do, I must recommend to Deputy Higgins that he take it back and try to rework it with the benefit of broader advice to avoid the various pitfalls into which it has fallen.  Nonetheless, I commend him for trying and hope that before the end of the year we might see a Government Bill that will tackle these two objectives.</P>
    <P>In being grateful to Deputy Higgins for bringing this Bill before the House, I have to say that he could not have done so at a more opportune time.  Even as I speak a debate is raging about the relationship between media moguls and the political system, and that debate is likely to intensify before the end of the week.  There is now huge public interest in the nature of the relationship between the leader of the Labour Party and the top brass in Independent Newspapers.  I am somewhat surprised the Labour Party has not called for these matters to be investigated by a tribunal of inquiry.  Has it any plans to do so?  For my own part I can only look on in wonder at the unfolding relationship between big business and the political system.</P>
    <P>Current events are particularly interesting in the light of the imminent merger between the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  I would have thought neither Deputy De Rossa nor Deputy Rabbitte would have been great fans of Independent Newspapers in recent times.  Maybe we could end up with two parties after the merger &mdash; Independent Labour and non-Independent Labour. I made a suggestion in the past on a number of occasions which drew fierce criticism down on my head from the newspapers and RTE, namely, that opinion polls be banned during election campaigns. In the light of recent revelations, I wonder if there are any members of the Labour Party who are willing to support me now on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. J. McGuinness Mr. J. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that Deputy Higgins has brought this Bill before the House.  It is both premature and insufficient, but at least it gives us the opportunity to publicly debate this issue, to tease it out and to become better acquainted with an important and complex issue which will have a significant impact on all our lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is inadequate because it underestimates <Col N="137" /> the significance and complexity of the subject with which it seeks to deal.  It echoes the provisions of the European Broadcasting Directive and seeks to provide criminal sanctions for broad-casters who contravene those provisions.  It is too simplistic in its coverage of these important areas and ignores or avoids dealing with the pitfalls that any Government faces in confronting the many commercial and legal problems which need to be overcome if the matter is to be dealt with fully.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I welcome the Bill, viewing it as a starting point from which we can begin to build a comprehensive body of legislation to deal with the many complex issues involved in this matter. We must take our time and carefully examine not only the current position but that which will obtain in the future in regard to what might happen in an industry which is in a state of flux and rapidly changing.  We need to carefully examine the legislation of the country at the cutting edge of all kinds of technology, the USA, while reminding ourselves of the problem it has had to face with Microsoft.  We must proceed with care and our preparation and research should include soundings from all the sporting bodies here.</P>
    <P>We must not forget there is another side to this coin which has the possibility of serious revenue for these organisations.  While I agree that our major sporting events by and large should be available free of charge, I would like to hear the views of our sporting bodies in regard to that revenue possibility which I am sure will be laid seductively before them.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the question of property rights and how a government can become involved without infringing on those rights.  The question might be asked: should we become involved?  The whole area is a legal minefield which we should approach with extreme caution; certainly the Attorney General will have to be consulted in the matter.</P>
    <P>We are now in a world where big business is happy to take on governments, as Microsoft recently demonstrated.  We have a duty to ensure that the rights of people to view major sporting events are protected and that major cost will not be incurred.  It is unacceptable that a person should have to pay to watch, for instance, the All-Ireland finals.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the power of multinational media companies.  I am mindful of the manipulation of both the Conservative and Labour parties in the UK and the involvement of Murdoch's huge media empire in general elections. The power of these empires, which are increasingly in the hands of a small number of moguls, fills me with apprehension.  However, we are dealing with international law and also with an issue which, because of its complexity and rapid development, is the subject of legislation which might be suspect.  We cannot hope to meet this challenge if we do not take great care and the best possible advice.</P>
    <P>We live in an environment where Governments are more likely to be challenged and where our <Col N="138" /> culture and that of other countries is subject to unprecedented attack from people whose sole objective seems to be profit and power at any cost.</P>
    <P>I accept the point made by RTE about 20 per cent of the budget for its programmes being allocated to independent productions.  The thrust of its argument will be that the cost should be divided between TnaG and TV3.  However, I would like to have more information before adopting a position on it.  The promotion of independent productions has wide-ranging advantages to our culture and economy.  I speak from experience having been involved with the young group of Irish film makers in Kilkenny where I saw the enormous cultural and social benefits this art form has brought to hundreds of young people in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am happy that the review group will take all aspects of this legislative area into consideration when it puts together what I hope will be a comprehensive package later this year. While I cannot support the Bill I support the approach the Minister is taking in relation to providing the necessary legislation in this area.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and thank the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  This is a timely and important Bill which deserves support and will get the support of my party.  It is a pity the Minister has chosen to reject the Bill.  I would have thought her reservations could be met by way of amendment on Committee Stage rather than an outright rejection of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The democratic checks and balances in relation to the media are an issue upon which this House cannot afford to adopt a leisurely approach.  That we live in an information age has become a truism, yet we have enough evidence to be deeply concerned about the style, content and ownership of the media transmitting such information both globally and here in Ireland and its implications in terms of democratic accountability.  We must have a serious debate and take action in relation to this central issue to modern life.  I am concerned that the Minister is not taking the initiative in the way the situation demands.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with two areas, one of which is the broadcasting of sporting and other events.  It is clear that intense financial pressures and competition for audience share has led to greater rivalry for exclusivity in regard to such events.  The Bill states that such events must always be free, whether broadcast live or deferred.  That vital principle must be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own county of Wicklow we are currently preparing for the <i>Tour de France</i> and enormous effort, commitment and money is going into <Col N="139" /> ensuring the tour is a success.  The idea that one would have to pay to view an event of such scale or any event that has the support of many people is abhorrent in a democracy and across a democratic Europe.  Indeed, EU Ministers are no doubt vulnerable to their electorate in the way we are in this House.  We are accountable to an electorate that enjoys sporting and cultural events.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill is the one on which I want to concentrate because it is a central issue which relates to cross-media ownership.  It deals with the question of the dominant position of any one company as regards media and media ownership.  I accept it is a complex issue, and the Bill deals only with the particular aspect of cross-media ownership, but ensuring there is diversity in the various forms of media is something that is complex in its nature and in the response required.  All Members understand that and it is unfair to say that Deputy Higgins is not aware of it.  There is nobody in this House more aware because of his experience.</P>
    <P>In examining the question of ownership we must be conscious that it is not just a simple matter of ownership of newspapers or television. There is more than one way to control a newspaper. If a company like Independent Newspapers, for example, did not have a majority on the board of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> but still paid the bills, there are ways of ensuring that control is in place even though it may not be expressed in the pure form of ownership.  I am concerned the matter of ownership is not fully addressed.  Perhaps it is unfair to expect it would be addressed in this Bill, but it is an important aspect.  Theoretically, it could mean that one owner would own 100 per cent of one medium and, under the Bill, it would be limited to 24.99 per cent of another.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Higgins speak about the percentages of the Irish market owned by the Independent Group.  We must be precise in terms of the statistical evidence we provide &mdash; for example, whether the Irish market is solely the market for Irish newspapers or whether it also includes British newspapers.</P>
    <P>One in four daily papers and one in three Sunday papers here are edited in Britain.  That highlights an aspect of media ownership that must be considered carefully.  Such encroachment and penetration of the market has given credibility to the Independent Group's defensive, aggressive style which is essentially &ldquo;what is good for the Independent Group is good for Ireland&rdquo;.  There are fundamental dangers in that approach.  We only have to look at the example in another industry where Irish Distillers developed a monopoly. At the end of the day the argument was whether it would be French or British owned and a chauvinistic debate ensued.  Questions must be raised that are wider than the Bill.  The question not only of diversity of titles but diversity of ownership is central to this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to undue political influence where there is a monopoly and control <Col N="140" /> of a medium, and I agree with him.  I am impressed he had time to consider the position of Opposition Deputies.  He seemed quite involved in the future of Democratic Left and the Labour Party, which I am sure will be rosy, but I would have thought he would be totally exercised with the emerging information on what is happening and concerns about Progressive Democrat's Government partner.  I thank the Deputy for taking time out from his deliberations, keeping up with every wave of scandal and horror story about the Government, to think about the Opposition.</P>
    <P>On promoting diversity, I appreciate there is no simple solution.  This is a complex issue in that there is globalisation of the market.  The global strength is so powerful and all-pervasive that the idea that we as a small country can take total control of our media is inappropriate.  We are in a position where we can, with imaginative measures and initiatives, encourage diversity which may not always be income or profit generating but would ensure a multiplicity of views, particularly in the written media.  The example I would cite is Holland where a press fund was established.  With the advent of commercial television in Holland, a proportion of the advertising levy was used to provide funding to support newspapers.  That enabled small newspapers that were not in a position to survive without support to be sustained and, in some cases, to grow.  Even within groups where one paper was not profit making, the press fund was used to ensure its future.  We should consider that and other initiatives with a view to their application here.</P>
    <P>We must ensure diversity of ownership, diversity of title and a range of opinion.  We should not under-estimate the importance of protecting the range of opinions, whether political, cultural, sporting or whatever, that must be maintained not only by a diversity of titles but by a diversity of ownership.  There is a link between a monopoly of ownership and a monopoly of views, but it may not always be apparent.  Where self-interest is involved, it is guaranteed that monopoly of view will be expressed forcefully.  We have seen that in modified form here and we must be on our guard in that respect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate Deputy Higgins for introducing it.  I ask the Minister to think long and hard before she rejects it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome this timely Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  Its genesis lies in the lengthy work the Deputy carried out as Minister, in the discussions that took place on developing our culture and encouraging cultural diversity, diversity of expression and freedom of expression.  The Bill is another milestone in Deputy Higgins' remarkable career in this House and his remarkable contribution to life and the philosophy of Irish citizenship which he developed with great care and idealism in his opening remarks last night.  That is typical of the man who established the Department <Col N="141" /> of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and created, for the first time in our history, a distinct public awareness of the necessity to develop public policy at the highest levels to strengthen and encourage the artistic achievement of our people, to encourage diversity without fear or favour from any quarter.  I thank him for his contribution over the years.</P>
      <P>One of the disappointing features of the past couple of decades has been the ability of organisations such as News International, Sky television and BSkyB to cherrypick high quality events, particularly in the area of sport and other areas of popular culture, and concentrate their monopoly of power and ability to extract the highest price from the public for their observation of those events.  Contrast that with, for example, our national broadcasting organisation, RTE, and its remarkable achievements over the past 68 to 70 years.  It is a wonderful contrast.  RTE is in the classic mode of national broadcasting organisations, such as the BBC and others in Europe, which have enriched the lives of populations over the past three or four generations.  Think of all the work of the RTE orchestras, the various choirs and Cór na nÓg and the other cultural initiatives the station and its various components undertake.  Think also of RTE's great tradition of high quality independent news and news reporting over the past 25 to 30 years which has made a valuable contribution to political life on this island.  It also has a remarkable tradition in the area of culture.  The Minister and Deputy Higgins will engage in discussions over the coming months and years about the direction of public sector broadcasting.  It is critical that we ensure the cultural development of our country is not easily cast aside by caving in to monopolists, oligopolists and people who would tell us what to think.</P>
      <P>In that context, I will respond to remarks made by the former leader of the Progressive Democrats on this matter.  This Bill has been in genesis for many months and the Labour Party, through its spokesperson, brought it forward with out fear or favour.  We sincerely believe it is a modest and simple proposal which is right for the future of our nation.  I hope the Minister will take it on board.  It is critical given the introduction of the euro over the next six months.  I spoke to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, about this issue last night at a committee and about the great dangers and responsibility which he and the Taoiseach have, to steer our economy through these difficulties and the difficult times ahead. The Minister also has a special responsibility in the area of culture, news and freedom of expression, which I hope she will be prepared to discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has no problem demanding that any news organisation will not have a dominant position in more than one area of the media and that there will not be a sprawling incubus of organisations spreading across the intellectual domain of a nation.  That is the Minister's <Col N="142" /> responsibility.  Each Sunday we continue to read articles by Michael McDowell and other people in the Progressive Democrats.  While they are entitled to put forward their views, we cannot allow a situation where one newspaper or media group would seek to impose its economic views on the people or on this House.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to my party's Bill.  It is timely legislation which, if accepted by the Minister will ensure all citizens will have access to important events of cultural or national importance.  It will also ensure a diversity of media ownership thereby preventing media empires from emerging and dominating our society.  The two simple proposals in this Bill are about democracy and the cultural rights of citizens in a democratic society.  The principle of universal access gives all citizens the right to view matters of major importance, including cultural and sporting events.  The diversity in media ownership allows for plurality of opinion, which is of benefit to both the media practitioners and the consumers of media products.</P>
    <P>In the current climate of digitalisation, this Bill has a particular worth.  From some of the Minister's recent comments, I know she is concerned about the onset of this technology, as indeed was her predecessor who for many years warned of the need to prepare for it.  The digitalisation of television will supersede the existing analogue based systems of TV broadcasting and is set to be introduced in the near future.  It will give rise to improvements in the quality of picture and sound but will also provide the consumer with access to more channels &mdash; up to 200 or so &mdash; and interactive services.  As the former Minister, Deputy Higgins, said, we are facing a scenario where one screen on our wall will be an interactive service covering the Internet, consumer needs and cultural and information services.</P>
    <P>However, without appropriate legislation from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, we are in danger of allowing a market driven form of digitalisation to open up a further divide in society between the information rich and the information poor.  This legislation, prepared by my colleague, would pave the way for a more citizen based model of digitalisation. Ownership of digital television would be in the hands of the people and would not become a vehicle for profiteering and multinational business.</P>
    <P>I am concerned the Minister is unaware of the urgency and speed at which we are approaching digitalisation and unless we are prepared to deal with its introduction, Ireland will be left lagging behind.  Next year Sky television will offer a digitalised service and contracts are now being signed.  We must ask if this country will be prepared and that is the Minister's responsibility.</P>
    <P>In relation to universal access to events of major significance like sporting events, this Bill gives the citizen the firm right to view events like the All-Ireland Football Final without restriction. Maintaining the televising of such an event on <Col N="143" /> terrestrial television allows more equality of access across society.  It also ensures that access is granted to people beyond national boundaries. People should not only have access to football matches if they attend pubs which subscribe to certain television channels, a point to which I will return.  Monday nights in areas of the northside of Dublin have become a different type of evening culturally since Sky television began to show football matches a number of years ago.  Universal access gives people the right to enjoy cultural or sporting events without boundaries.  If we do not legislate for universal access, we could find the merits of All-Ireland day will only be available to those who subscribe to certain television channels or attend pubs which subscribe to those channels.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which deals with ownership, is crucial to universal access.  The Labour Party accepts the need for investment in media groups. However, it is against the creation of media monopolies and empires.  My party also accepts the right of the media to comment on and take positions on public affairs.  However, it is concerned about any possible future concentration of ownership in the media across different media vehicles.  It is in the public interest that media access is as wide as possible.</P>
    <P>A diversity of media ownership contributes to a healthier democracy.  This is particularly the case in relation to news.  If news is manufactured from the one media organisation, citizens are only given one spin, so to speak, on a story.  A variety of news delivered by a variety of media outlets enhances the citizen's access to news and views. In this way, citizens can make up their own minds and contribute to a more enhanced democracy.</P>
    <P>Our society is more diverse than ever before. We live in a pluralist society and require a pluralist media.  Our society is now characterised by mixed cultures, a range of political views and greater participation by various representative groups in the lobbying process.  As a result, it is imperative that there is a full range of information coming from different angles to ensure that everyone's concerns are aired and addressed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that when I go to my local shop on Sunday, of Irish newspapers on display, 90 per cent are part owned or are owned completely by Independent Newspapers.  While I do not cast any aspersions on workers and journalists in these papers &mdash; in many cases, I greatly admire and enjoy their work &mdash; I do not believe we are provided with sufficient plurality in editorial terms. Objectivity can only be provided where there is a diversity of ownership because at the end of the day, media owners are the people with influence. While I wish the two largest parties would consider a merger so that there might be a proper debate of ideas, if all political parties decided to merge, the end result would be that the electorate would have no choice of Government, and it would result in less choice in terms of political debate.  In such circumstances, the qualities of a democratic society would be eroded.  Because of <Col N="144" /> the huge role played by the media in influencing the views and information available to citizens the control of sections of the media by one vast empire would equally erode democracy.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about Sky and News International.  I notice that our colleagues in the British Parliament have drawn up a list of a number of events they would consider critical, the type of events the Bill seeks to protect under section 2.  Many people would say coverage of the two All-Ireland championships, soccer and rugby internationals, major running events and others are events to which everyone should have general access.  The Minister has a key responsibility to ensure that type of access for the future.  There has been considerable competition regarding the next European football championship in that the new television station, TV3, has out bid RTE for coverage.  For the first time, we will not watch those matches on RTE, but at least they will be shown by an Irish station to which we will have full access.  It is critical such key sporting events are maintained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins spoke at length last night about the efforts of the 15 EU member states, using the television without frontiers directive and others, to try to ensure the sporting and cultural life of Europe was not decimated by the Anglo-American cultural world.  I mentioned Monday evenings on the north side of Dublin where distinct cultural effects can be seen and this is probably true of the Minister's home town of Ennis as well.  Many young men and women interested in professional football feel the need to watch a match with Manchester United or Newcastle on television in a certain hostelry.  The owner is probably paying through the nose for the right to show the matches.  This creates a system of access which is completely market driven and which has no cultural connections.  That is something I would like the Minister to examine.</P>
    <P>On section 2 which deals with the concentration of ownership, Deputy Higgins thoughtfully laid out the key areas in which he wanted the 25 per cent rule to apply, such as a group which occupied a dominant position in one or more markets.  I mentioned the situation in Ireland but we have witnessed the recent history of the United Kingdom.  Many people in this House remember the election of 1979 in the UK where a huge impetus from <i>The Sun</i> and other newspapers was behind the Conservative Party.  I remember one headline which ran: &ldquo;Give The Girl A Chance&rdquo; and it was the dominant headline in a close election in which our sister party was defeated.  That election outcome has been examined and most people believe the performance of <i>The Sun</i> and other newspapers, who were and are members of a dominant group, had a strong influence on the election.</P>
    <P>We remember the election here last summer. We believe it was very unfair when, on the front page of a newspaper under the headline &ldquo;It's Pay-back Time&rdquo;, readers were directed to vote for certain parties.  No one denies that good journalists <Col N="145" /> and political commentators must have views on who should run the country and that newspapers take stances on issues.  I remember the editor of <i>The Sunday Times</i>, one of the News International papers, on 1 May last year in a famous editorial stated: &ldquo;Hold your nose and vote Tory&rdquo;.  Deputy Higgins has made a powerful case regarding the concentration of ownership.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and applaud her for some of the initiatives she has taken during her ministry.  She has shown quiet effectiveness. However, I believe this is a Bill worthy of being accepted by the Government.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Higgins on the introduction of the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on her work to date and for her many visits to Cork North-West over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Bill allows for a debate on various issues relating to media ownership and so forth and one of the most important issues raised by it is the access to television coverage of major events, be they social, cultural or sporting.  The vast majority of us would know where we were when David O'Leary scored that goal in the 1990 World Cup in Italy as we do when many other events occurred such as the death last August of Princess Diana or the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.</P>
      <P>It is possible to imagine access to television coverage of sporting events such as the World Cup or Gaelic games having to be paid for and not being available free on television.  In that context, I compliment the Minister on the press release she issued last evening in which she mentioned the priority of the Government to ensure major sporting events remain available to Irish viewers on free to air television.  A culture has developed where, if tickets for a match cannot be obtained, people watch it on television with their families in the comfort of their living rooms.  If we have to pay for access to such coverage and people must go to pubs or clubs to gain access to it, it will probably break up the family unit and that must be discouraged at all costs.  The rate of social change at the moment means there is considerable pressure on families and anything which can be done at any level by any Department should be done to ensure as much support as possible is given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I understand from the Minister that legislation covering these areas is at an advanced stage of preparation, the debate is an opportunity to raise many issues.  At a meeting in my constituency recently, there was a debate about the media and its power.  One elderly lady said that, when she was growing up in the 1940s and 1950s, the <Col N="146" /> parish priest, the bishop and the archbishopreigned supreme and had exclusive power, whereas now the editors of newspapers or television programmes reign supreme.  It is a worthwhile point and, while it may be a little simplistic, it is valid nonetheless and one which should be borne in mind when drafting legislation such as this.  RTE is legally obliged to allocate 20 per cent of its programming budget to independent productions but it is looking for a change in this legislation. Changes have taken place since the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993.  There has been the advent of TnaG and TV3 will soon come on stream.  Twenty per cent of RTE's programming budget amounts to between £12 million and £15 million.  We have seen recent newspaper reports indicating an increase in the viewing figures for TnaG and the advertising market has become more competitive.  Therefore, there is a case to be made on the 20 per cent quota.</P>
    <P>The most important issue is Article 3<i>a</i> of the EU Broadcasting Directive and we must ensure that major sporting events are free to air.  We have all seen the value of people having free access to various sporting events.  However, a number of important sporting events have been taken off free to air television, including the Ryder Cup and Stephen Collins' defence of his world title.  There have been many high points in Irish sporting history which have given people a good feeling.  We have done well in the World Cup and Stephen Roche won the <i>Tour de France</i> in 1987.  At county level there is great confidence when a county wins a provincial or All Ireland title.  These are important social events and sport is very important to social life.  Many young are very impressed by sporting stars and we must ensure that we have free access to as many sporting events as possible.  It is not right if parents have to take children into clubs or pubs to watch sporting events.  This is detrimental to the family unit and does not encourage people to socialise at home.</P>
    <P>There is much common ground between this Bill and the Bill which will be introduced by the Minister.  The Minister's Bill is being prepared in consultation with two other Departments.  It is important that whatever results from these deliberations is well thought out and researched.  Technology has advanced greatly in the past three or four years and it will continue to do so.  We have to take account of these developments as we plan for the future.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with cross media ownership and related matters.  This is a minefield but it requires careful planning and consideration.  Some of the proposals in Deputy Higgins' Bill which deal with shared and cross ownership should be included in the Minister's Bill.</P>
    <P>The issue of BSkyB, Rupert Murdoch and pay per view channels has come up in committee in representations from various interested groups. These areas are experiencing tremendous growth and one of the fears is that one such channel could dangle a large cheque in front of a sporting <Col N="147" /> organisation.  Many sporting organisations are strapped for funds as they are trying to support clubs and halls throughout the country and money is a great incentive.  BSkyB and Rupert Murdoch can offer any amount of money to a sporting organisation and the forthcoming legislation must ensure that this is not allowed to happen. This is a sensitive area and various legal issues have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I commend most of what is in this Bill. However, it is better that we study it carefully.  It will be the blueprint for future media broadcasting legislation.  The comments of the elderly person in Cork are becoming more relevant.  We cannot legislate for everything but the Minister should take them into account in her deliberations. We have seen the power of the media and newspaper editors, not only in politics but in every aspect of life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I commend Deputy Higgins for its introduction.  I agree with many of its principles but disagree with much of the detail.  The Bill is narrow in focus.  It deals with only two specific issues.  There are many other issues in the broadcasting industry that must also be dealt with.  I hope the Government's legislation will include a much wider range of issues.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill, I want to refer to the transmission of television signals throughout the country.  If I want to get a full range of television services in my village in County Laois, I must have an aerial for RTE 1 and Network 2, another for the MMDS stations and yet another for Teilifís na Gaeilge.  If I want the satellite stations I must also put a satellite dish on the roof.  It is appalling that in 1998 I must have four monstrosities on the roof of my house to get a full range of services.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the concept of free television. There is no such thing.  The four items I mentioned cost money, in addition to the cost of a television licence.  While the concept of free television is great in theory, it does not happen in practice.  The cost associated with the MMDS service or the cable system in urban areas runs at well over £100 per annum.  We should not delude ourselves by talking of nice concepts that do not exist.</P>
      <P>Many of the problems in this area will be resolved by technology.  We live in an evolving technological age.  A generation ago there were very few televisions, whereas we can now get instant television from the far side of the world as well as from space.  The world in general is coming to terms with the new technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most significant advance in terms of television transmission will be digital TV.  It is important that we make the correct decision about digital TV.  I have a copy of a beautiful document that RTE presented to the joint committee on its proposals for digital TV.  While we should study the document carefully and analyse <Col N="148" /> it in great detail, one should have a large grain of salt beside one when doing so.  I take grave exception to some of its recommendations.  The document began by stating what RTE wanted and went on to construct the rest of the document to back up its opening position.  In referring to how we should handle digital TV, it states:</P>
    <P>A consideration of these factors indicates that Ireland is ideally suited to terrestrial distribution of digital TV &mdash; rather than any other mode.  The population is small and spread widely across remote rural areas.  Mountain ranges add to the transmission difficulties. These factors preclude the cost effective deployment of either cable or MMDS.systems.</P>
    <P>Even though the MMDS system operates here, in a cavalier manner, RTE states it is unsuitable for Ireland.  I agree it is unsuitable because the people who have been licensed to provide the service have not been in a position to provide it to households that are willing to pay for it.  It is outrageous that large sections of the community are being deprived of a television service which they are rightfully entitled to watch and willing to pay for.  In the following paragraph, the document goes on to state:</P>
    <P>While satellite distribution of digital TV is possible, this would not be in Ireland's national interest &mdash; since it would likely be controlled by foreign interests distributing foreign programming. Moreover, if the satellite platform were to be used as a vehicle for electronic commerce, it is likely that any electronic transactions would take place outside Irish jurisdiction and involve transfers out of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I do not accept it is too expensive.  Every new invention is expensive at the outset.  It goes on to refer to the high expense of leasing satellite space, the necessity for the consumer to buy a dish rather than using an existing TV aerial and states that the cost of satellite is not feasible.  I urge the Minister to study the question of satellite TV carefully.  Every household should be able to get the full range of television services by digital TV and the only way this can be done satisfactorily, bearing in mind our topography and geographical spread, is by satellite.  With a satellite dish one can get reception from as far away as South America.  The consumer must be consulted in any discussions on this matter.  It is pointless having a product that suits the industry but that is not consumer friendly.</P>
    <P>Another major advantage of digital TV is that, due to technology, it can be adapted to allow for regional advertising.  RTE has quoted costs in this regard, but the cost to the consumer could be reduced substantially if advertising is sold on a provincial or regional basis.  Local radio has been an outstanding success.  It has high listenership in every county, at no cost to the listener.  It is free to listeners because advertisers pay for it.  There <Col N="149" /> is no reason we should not extend the logic we successively adopted in relation to local radio to the television service.  Commercial interests have the money and the power and if they know their product is being beamed into every household, they will pay for the advertising.  This is a technological as well as a financial issue and we must ensure the cost to the consumer is as reasonable as possible.  The transmission of television signals is an unresolved issue in many counties.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general sentiments of the Bill. Major events should be broadcast to all members of the public, if possible.  However, the Bill does not include a schedule of events to be covered and, more importantly, it does not state how such events could be defined.  The Bill also gives the Minister too much power, even though I know the Minister would not take advantage of that. The type of events to be covered should be outlined in legislation rather than by regulation and is important that public representatives have an input in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill is strong on getting the service to the consumer, but it does not take account of the rights of the various sporting organisations.  Major sporting organisations, such as the GAA, the IRFU or the soccer federations, have built up a good product and are entitled to get the free market price for the television rights to their product. Some of those large organisations have invested heavily in the youth and provided facilities for their members and supporters.  I would have a difficulty accepting legislation that would artificially reduce the potential income to which some of these sporting organisations are entitled in a free country.  I caution against depriving those organisations of their constitutional right to sell their property at a fair price.</P>

      <P>Some major sporting events such as the Steve Collins fight occur not for the sake in this case of the boxing match, but because the television organisations knew that if they promoted the event on a pay per view system they would generate enough income to profit from the event.  I am concerned that while participation by a major Irish sports person or world champion, such as Steve Collins, in an event would be considered important in the context of Irish society, under the Bill it would not be possible to stage a pay per view contest.  The Bill might be too restrictive and have the effect of preventing major sporting events coming to Ireland which might otherwise come in a less restrictive environment.</P>

      <P>Most of us who pay 48 per cent tax spend half our time working for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Television is a global issue and must be seen in more than an Irish or European context.  We cannot solve the problems at European level.  The issues are global and must be tackled globally, <Col N="150" /> although I do not know in which forum, rather than in the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or the Commission.  Everybody is aware that technology knows no boundaries and will continue to expand and develop in terms of resources.</P>
    <P>The legislation also raises the issue of preventing one person from having exclusive rights to major events.  This implies that rights should be open to at least two people.  However, I would be equally worried by this as two people can easily form as effective a cartel as one person can form a monopoly.  It is not just a matter of the number of people with exclusive rights to broadcast events, but of how they use their power.  In many industries in the past we have seen how several players could form cartels.  I am as concerned about cartels as I am about monopolies in this area.</P>
    <P>The criminal penalties in the Bill are too extreme.  First, it will be hard to define where a crime is committed as events may be broadcast from the other side of the world.  Second, I believe the only appropriate sanctions are commercial in nature.  An attempt could be made to prevent a company broadcasting in breach of the legislation if prior knowledge of the breach was received through, for example, ensuring it did not receive its intended source of funds, fining it, refusing to give it a licence to transmit in the State on a future occasion or making it pay compensation to its competitors which it unfairly excluded.  Sanctions should be commercial rather than criminal in nature.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about concentration of ownership which not only applies to the media but to every area of society in Ireland and worldwide. Across the world the biggest car companies in Europe and America are merging.  We will reach a situation where all these worldwide companies will begin merging and there will be a concentration of ownership in every sphere of society unless the process is checked somewhere along the line.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputy Michael Higgins to clarify the five areas of broadcasting.  He speaks of broadcasting as including terrestrial television, newspapers, magazines, satellite and digital television and the Internet.  I assume he includes radio in the general definition of broadcasting.</P>

      <P>I did not see radio referred to. We cannot look at ownership in an Irish context as many of the papers sold and television stations viewed here are British while many satellite television stations are broadcasting the American news every night.  The solution will be found in new technology and by examining the issue in a global sense.</P>

      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Richard Bruton.  As a former Minister with responsibility for sport, I wish to refer to one aspect of the Bill.  BSkyB is being cast in the role <Col N="151" /> of villain of the piece.  For far too long I have seen television companies, including RTE, show utter complacency in relation to the coverage of sporting events.  The advent of BSkyB has acted as a catalyst in getting stations involved in more imaginative coverage of sporting events.</P>
      <P>Some time ago in the House I questioned the wisdom of RTE scrapping &ldquo;Sports Stadium&rdquo; from its Saturday schedule.  In doing so I attracted the wrath of RTE's director general who that evening went on the main evening news bulletin to deal with my complaint and rubbish the points I made.  My case was borne out some weeks ago when I switched on my television at 3.10 p.m. one Saturday.  On one channel RTE was showing a pre-war film while on the other it was showing cartoons.  Saturday afternoon is a time for sporting events but our national television station was totally ignoring sport.  This was not doing sport a great service.</P>
      <P>On another occasion I was driving and listening to how Sonia O'Sullivan was performing in MorocCo. The RTE radio commentator was watching Eurosport to get news of how she was doing.  At 3 o'clock Bill O'Herlihy said the latest news from Morocco was that Sonia O'Sullivan had won the world cross-country championships, an event which occurred about an hour and a half before the announcement.</P>
      <P>RTE has failed to provide adequate coverage of a broad cross section of sport.  It is very good in covering professional English soccer, professional rugby and top class GAA games.  However, it has essentially ignored minority sports.  I was appalled when told recently at a dinner that the Badminton Association of Ireland had to pay RTE to get a slot on &ldquo;Sports Stadium&rdquo; on Saturday afternoons.</P>
      <P>The advent of BSkyB has acted as a catalyst for other stations to provide a more comprehensive and imaginative coverage of sporting events. Sky Sports has done a magnificent service to international sport which must not be overlooked. However, in acknowledging the contribution of that organisation to sport, we must not overlook the downside and the threat to sporting event.  We must not back away from the threat of closing coverage of major sporting events, be they international or national, to a broad cross section of our community.</P>
      <P>The UK has faced up to the issue by preparing its own list of protected events.  As Minister with responsibility for sport I believed we could not deal with the issue on our own, that there had to be a pan-European approach and I and others raised the issue in a European context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must deal with what has been achieved. The directive can be used to introduce legislation which must be implemented after broad consultation with sporting bodies.  I regret the Government has decided not to accept the Bill on the grounds that it is not sufficiently comprehensive, in the same manner in which it rejected my Bill on a statutory sports council.  Having rejected <Col N="152" /> these Bills the Government is failing to introduce legislation, despite having all the necessary resources to do so.</P>
    <P>Consultation must take place as major sporting organisations, such as Cumann Lúthchleas Gael, the FAI and the IRFU, also have rights.  They have carried out a great service to Irish people. Their rights to profit from major sporting events must be taken into consideration in regard to any legislation which may be drafted.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>The massive growth in the number of women in the workforce in the past 25 years has contributed significantly to the success of the economy.  In the past 20 years, the number of women in the workforce has grown by more than 212,000, reaching 448,000 in 1996.  In 1997, more than 512,000, or four in every ten, people in employment were women.  In the 25-44 year cohort of women, almost two thirds now work outside the home.  In 1977, only 14 per cent of women in the workforce were married but, by 1996, married women accounted for 47 per cent of women workers.  This change has resulted from a growing awareness of the need to reconcile family life and work opportunities and the State also has a duty to reconcile these competing demands,</P>
      <P>The rearing, conditioning and education of children is vital to future generations and parents have a key role to play.  The State should endeavour to facilitate them in every possible way.  The introduction of this Bill will serve to increase the number of women in the workforce and will provide an opportunity for fathers to be involved in rearing their children.</P>
      <P>Irish society has changed immensely in recent years.  One in five children is born to a single mother.  We must urgently examine and legislate for the role of the father in a changing society. The State does not facilitate single fathers who wish to fulfil their obligations and responsibilities as parents.  Single parents, as of right, should be entitled to a relationship with their children.  To date, the presumption in law has been that single fathers do not have such rights and must obtain the agreement of a child's mother to get them. The law facilitates the rights of single mothers to access and rear children but hinders the role of single fathers in fulfilling their rights and obligations. Custody or guardianship cannot be arranged without obtaining the agreement of a child's mother and the State does not facilitate single fathers in establishing guardianship or joint guardianship without the mother's agreement.  If the mother's agreement is not forthcoming, the matter must be dealt with in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law children of single parents are <Col N="153" /> discriminated against in comparison with those of a married couple in regard to their relationships with their fathers.  Their relationships have an inferior status in the eyes of the law and society in general.  We must examine the role of the father in a changing society.  It is important that children have knowledge of, and be exposed to the influence of, their fathers.  Children of single parents are also entitled to the acquaintance and friendship of their fathers' families, their uncles, aunts and so on.  The State should uphold such rights.  While accepting we have made some progress in recognising children who are not born within marriage, including abolition of the concept of illegitimacy, we must nonetheless continue to recognise that families are very different today from what they were in the past.  If we continue to promote the principle that parentage is, in effect, tied up with marriage, particularly in the case of fathers, we are not recognising the needs of children born to single parents and are not responding to the direction in which society is moving.  We must reform our approach to ensure we do that and reflect the reality of life.  It would be nice to think traditional family structures and supports could continue.  Four out of five families still adhere to that model but the trend is changing; one in every four children currently born in County Louth is born to a single mother.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, fathers wielded a great deal of control within families and mothers were, in effect, dependent on them.  That has changed and in many circumstances, fathers are now dependent on mothers for access to their children.  It is not acceptable for a mother to have the sole right to grant guardianship of her child to its father.  At present, the mother's right is absolute.  If a mother agrees to an unmarried father becoming a guardian, the procedure can be carried out very easily.</P>
    <P>The role of the father is not sufficiently developed and recognised within Irish society.  I am not happy with a society in which so many mothers are raising children on their own and in which children have no knowledge of their fathers, either because their fathers do not want to know them or are prevented from knowing them.  Legislation must be drafted to address that. It takes two people to have a baby and it should take two people to rear it.  The responsibilities and rights of fatherhood are not being addressed in regard to single parents and sufficient consideration is not being given to the significant changes which have occurred in our society.  We must establish fathers' rights in a way which challenges them to fulfil their responsibilities.  Deputy McGahon stated that too many single fathers do not face up to their responsibilities to support and have a relationship with their children.  If we do not ensure such rights are established, we are simply enforcing a pattern which will not be good for society as a whole or for parents, be they married or single.  It is in children's best interests, unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary, to know their fathers and have relationships with <Col N="154" /> them.  The emphasis must be on what is in the best interests of the child or children, but we often lose sight of that.  The overriding consideration in many marriage breakdowns seems to be what is convenient for the parents rather than what is in the best interests of the child or children. We cannot overemphasise or underestimate the importance of a father figure in a child's life. There is a void in the lives of children who do not have a father figure.  As more than 80 per cent of primary teachers are female, many children who are reared by their mother do not have contact with a father figure even in school.  Many children are being brought up with only their mother's influence in their lives.  That will have consequences for them in later life and that matter should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The report of the 1996 constitutional review group in considering the position of unmarried fathers pointed out that a natural father has no personal right to his child, which the State is bound to protect under Article 43 of the Constitution. It also pointed out that section 6(a) of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, as inserted in the Status of Children's Act, 1987, has been construed by the Supreme Court as giving an unmarried father a right to apply to court to be appointed guardian, as distinct from giving him the right to be a guardian, which could be annulled by the courts.  A father should have the right to be the guardian of his child.  That report also states that any criticism of the fact that a natural father does not have a constitutionally protected personal right in relation to his child can be readily undermined as regards a natural father who lives in a stable relationship with the natural mother or who has established a relationship with the child.</P>
    <P>We must face the reality that 12,500 children were born to unmarried parents last year and 700 applications were made by unmarried fathers for guardianship of their children.  We must seriously examine what is in our culture that determines the majority of fathers of children who are born outside marriage do not have a relationship with their children.  We must consider how we should cope with that position to ensure that children of unmarried parents have as stable a relationship as possible with both parents.</P>
    <P>One of the key aspects of a stable relationship is determined by whether one was influenced by one's mother and father.  We must do everything to ensure that society recognises the strong role of a father in influencing the upbringing of his child, irrespective of whether he is married to the child's mother.  We cannot turn back the clock to make society as it was 15 or 50 years ago.  There were many difficulties with that society which are not relevant to this debate.</P>
    <P>The trend of births outside marriage will continue to rise.  The State must recognise that and ensure that children know their fathers, their values and ensure that they influence their children. A child should grow up to recognise that a father and mother have a role to play in his or <Col N="155" /> her upbringing.  The State must send a strong signal that co-operation between parents should be the norm.  We must send a signal that the State recognises changes in society and that more than 20 per cent of children are born outside marriage. The State should signal that co-operation between both parents is expected, that it is there to facilitate such relationships and it expects fathers and mothers to be fully involved in rearing their children.  There is no such thing as a one parent family.  Every child has two parents and we must ensure that both are involved in a child's upbringing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not welcome or agree with this Bill.  I would support Government legislation to give women the opportunity to stay at home to raise their children.  Over the years many Governments have talked about introducing such legislation. Many women would like to stay at home, but they have to work out of necessity.  I know I will come under pressure from my two women colleagues at a later stage for saying that.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder so many people voted against the Amsterdam Treaty when we see the type of rubbish that comes out of Europe at times.  The next move will be to put pressure on employers to pay those who take 15 weeks' parental leave, but small businesses cannot afford to pay that. The average industrial wage is approximately £300 per week and employers have to pay their share of PRSI which brings that figure up to approximately £350 per week.  It would cost an employer approximately £5,000 to pay an employee on an average industrial wage 15 weeks' parental leave.  The next move will be to introduce paid parental leave on a statutory basis. That would be fine for the State because they would pass the tab on to the taxpayers and small businesses would have to pass on that cost to their customers.  That is how the system works.</P>
      <P>I was proud of my mother who raised 13 children. She worked hard inside and outside the home.  In those days one got nothing for nothing. One had to work.  Many housewives and mothers had to go out to earn a living because their husbands were good for nothing and there are still a few of them around.  They were no good when it came to bringing up their family.  The mother is the crucial figure in any home.  She looks after the family and she is the parent who should be supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago Garret FitzGerald talked about introducing a scheme to help women who wanted to stay at home.  That turned out to be only talk in the run up to the election.  Like all parties, when his party got into Government it did nothing about it.  The Opposition has all the answers, but when parties go into Government <Col N="156" /> they do nothing to address the problems.  That has happened since the foundation of this State. That is why in the run-up to the last few elections most parties did not promise women they would provide for them to stay at home to raise their families and return to the workplace at a later stage.  The Government could help women by increasing the children's allowance and giving them some payment to encourage them to stay at home.  Many of them would stay at home because by the time they collect their children from playschool and pay their child minders they have very little money left and they still have to pay their mortgage and provide for the household.  Many women would love to stay at home to rear their children until they had reached the age of seven or eight years and then return to work, but they cannot afford to do that.</P>
    <P>There is much talk of the Celtic tiger, but people are under more and more pressure.  Mortgages are increasing and it is difficult to cope. People who work are not entitled to a medical card or any other assistance from the State.  The State takes from them all the time.  Over the years Governments have not assisted families in the way they should have.  They have not assisted women who wanted to stay at home and raise their family and return to work at a later stage. Many women would do that if they had the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Employers are worried about this legislation. They are afraid they will have to pick up the tab eventually.  There have been many daft EU directives and we have implemented them, but we should do what the Italians do.  We should take everything that is good from Europe, the money, but leave the directives on the back burner.  Italy has done that for many years.  They have taken the money, but not worried about implementing the directives.  I have seen the results of these directives in the west of Ireland and they are ridiculous. People in Europe are trying to justify their jobs by dreaming up schemes and directives to be implemented in the Union.  The attitude appears to be, &ldquo;If we cannot justify ourselves, somebody else might be given the job&rdquo;.  They have too much time to dream up schemes, some of which are daft.  These people would be better off listening to women, mothers and families and introducing directives that would help them financially to raise their families.  That would be better than women having to go out to work as well as raise families and help children with homework at night.</P>
    <P>I have the utmost respect for the women of this country.  They were brilliant over the years and they are still brilliant.  They have worked hard under difficult circumstances and were never given the respect they deserved from Governments or from men.  For too long women were put down by men.  Thankfully, those days are over and they are well able to defend themselves and to fight for their cause.  Long may that continue. They were long enough working during the week and not being allowed out on a Saturday night.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I am reminded of a case I encountered a few days ago regarding a petition to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I wrote to the Minister about the petition but he was unable to do anything because of a decision by a District Justice with regard to a former Minister for Justice. In this case the husband was convicted of drunken driving and fined approximately £800. That did not stop him drinking but every week his poor wife had to take a few pounds from the social welfare payment and put it away to pay the fine.</P>
    <P>The gardaí have been calling to her door every week because a directive was sent by the Commissioner &mdash; another man who is good at issuing directives &mdash; to all stations instructing that all such debts be collected.  I would prefer to see the gardaí searching for murderers, robbers and drug dealers instead of knocking at women's doors seeking payment of their husbands' fines.  The woman in this case is dependent on social welfare. Every week she puts £10 of her social welfare payment in a box to pay the fine and lives in hope that her husband will not find it.  If he does, it will be spent on drink.  He does not care if he is imprisoned but she does.  She must look after the house and worry about the children and whether they need money for school or for a school trip.  She carries the responsibility because her husband has washed his hands of it.</P>
    <P>The women of this country are great and they should be given greater assistance, probably through their child benefit payment because it is the only income they receive.  They spend that money wisely.  Governments should help women to stay at home.  Many of them would love to do so although many others prefer to work outside the home.  That is their right and it should be upheld.  However, I am referring to women who wish to stay at home and look after their families.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be new policies in this regard in the near future.  Fianna Fáil Deputies in Opposition, like those of Fine Gael, talked about what they would do in Government.  They have now been in Government for a year and I hope progress on this issue will be made in the next budget.  Last December an extra £150 million was collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  Some of that money should be used to support the family and to assist women who want to stay at home. It should make life easier for women, unlike in the past when life was made difficult for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the petition system with a view to introducing legislation which will assist women such as my constituent.  There is no system in place to help them at present and, ultimately, it is the mothers who must worry in such situations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time and for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion.  I welcome the fact that the Bill has generated this debate. Deputy Ring made a wideranging contribution and outlined a number of serious problems which <Col N="158" /> beset many families.  I was also impressed by Deputy Neville's excellent contribution.  I hope these and other contributions will not be lost on the Minister and his officials.</P>
      <P>The worst thing the Dáil could do is build up the hopes of women that, at last, it will do something for housewives and then proceed to do nothing.  That would be a grave injustice to the hardworking, decent women who have strived so hard in difficult times.  Much has changed yet nothing has changed.  People say that housewives had a hard time in the 1940s and the 1950s.  That is true but there are as many pressures now even though there is a different climate.</P>
      <P>It is the natural instinct of a mother to be with her children.  When I got married it was traditional for women to cease working either when they married or when the first child was born. The wife stayed at home and reared the family. That was grand, particularly for people who could afford it.  There were not as many pressures or anxieties and ambitions were probably not as high as they are now.  This is a different era and there are tremendous pressures on families and on children.</P>
      <P>One-upmanship is one such pressure.  Children do not understand if money is not available for the right clothes and they are constantly bombarded by television advertisements and programmes. They create demands which result in wives having to struggle while their husbands work.  Alternatively, the husband might have neglected his duties and the wife might be obliged to work.  A growing industry is the provision of créches to take care of children while women work.  There is tremendous pressure on a wife who might have to get three children ready each morning to leave them with a childminder.  That is not her natural instinct.  She is then obliged to do a day's work, probably under pressure from her boss or the company for which she works. There are tremendous strains in that lifestyle.</P>
      <P>We can articulate those strains but how do we address them?  This Bill will not do it.  Perhaps large multinationals can absorb the costs involved in this legislation but small businesses cannot. There is no point passing this Bill and believing it will deal with the problem when it will not. How can extra income be put into households so wives can stay at home for longer?</P>
      <P>The children of today are the adults of tomorrow and the formative years from infancy to teens are immensely important.  If they are neglected, the nation will pay a price in the future.  Children will not understand the difference between right and wrong if they are not taught it by their parents. The home is where this teaching takes place and where the character and personality of children are formed.  It is a mother's instinct to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must consider the cost of living and the cost of putting a roof over one's head.  It is the aspiration of every couple to own their own home.  It is a particularly Irish trait, unlike in Europe where rented accommodation is more <Col N="159" /> popular.  I always encourage members of my family and people who come to my clinics to buy their own house.  Buying a house makes a statement about the future.  If somebody is renting property they have nothing at the end of the day. At least if one is paying a mortgage one owns the roof over one's head.</P>
    <P>However, two incomes are now required to meet a mortgage.  There is something radically wrong with that.  The mortgage is the biggest pressure on families.  One income is gone because the wife's income must pay it.  The family, therefore, continues to be a single income family.  The Government has tried to address the problem of house prices but it has not succeeded.  They continue to spiral even though the price of bricks and mortar has not increased.  However, the profit margins for speculators have increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>Cavan County Council tried to address the problem by providing start up homes for young couples.  I congratulate the county manager on his initiative.  The urban council set aside a five acre field for a pilot scheme of low cost, three bedroomed houses to give young couples a start in life with their first house.  That is the first issue we must address if we are sincere in our desire to help families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring said that wives usually take responsibility for meeting the household bills. That is probably not true of all cases because about 80 per cent of husbands take their responsibilities seriously.  However, everybody is aware of wayward husbands and sad, traumatic situations. At the end of the day, the children suffer.  They must do without, no matter how much this breaks their mother's heart, as the bank, the ESB and Telecom Éireann have to be paid and the television licence bought.</P>
    <P>We do not live in an ideal society.  Many couples with reasonably good jobs have said to me that they are not benefiting in the Celtic tiger economy.  The cost of child care is extremely high.  When combined with the cost of running a car and other expenses, what is the real income of a working mother?  About ten or 12 years ago Garret FitzGerald suggested that stay at home wives should receive a sum of £9.50 per week.  The equivalent figure today would be about £80 to £90.  If stay at home wives were in receipt of this amount, how much better off would they be during a child's formative years?  This is an investment we have to make if we are to avoid the worst aspects of human behaviour such as soccer violence through the lack of parental control.</P>
    <P>In addressing this problem the Minister should not pass the buck to employers, many of whom will not be able to meet the additional costs associated with this change.  Job sharing, perhaps on a week on, week off basis, has potential in this respect.</P>
    <P>Although not directly related, I ask the Minister to consider the position of fathers who neglect <Col N="160" /> their responsibilities.  A portion of their income, whether from employment or the State, should be deducted at source to meet the cost of maintenance.  This is one of the consequences &mdash; for the want of a better phrase &mdash; of loose living; too many young men believe they have no obligation to the children they have fathered.  While we can appeal to the churches, the State has a role to play in protecting young girls.  This is a problem we must address.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on parental leave which is an extremely important issue.  The debate in the Seanad and in this House has been fascinating and merits much reflection and thought.  The themes which have emerged cover wide areas of Irish life, including children's rights; the obligations, duties and rights of employers; whether profits should be interfered with; the connection between the workplace and the family; paid and unpaid leave; the unpaid work of women over generations which we have finally come to recognise and value; the values which are driving decision-making in this House about where we want to put our resources in the Celtic tiger to support families and children, to help people to combine work and family life and to ensure men and women have equal opportunities.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, women have mainly been responsible for child care.  As we approach the new millennium, they are operating not only in the private world of the family but also in the public world of work.  Thankfully, men have moved into the private arena and are more involved in looking after their children, emotionally and physically.  This is, therefore, an interesting time in terms of the change in relationships within the family and work practices. This presents new challenges.</P>
      <P>It does not do any good to look at the past through rose tinted spectacles and imagine that everything was absolutely wonderful.  Women and children as well as men had to endure much hardship.  Equally, we have to look realistically at the realities of modern society.  We cannot speak about the world of work as if it was totally different from the world of the family.  There are interconnections. I imagine this debate reflects some of the debate that took place when provision was made for the introduction of maternity leave, and on whether people should be entitled to take holidays from work and whether there should be canteens.  It is an interesting debate as it raises key questions about the allocation of resources at State level and the obligations and responsibilities of employers, the State and families and the interaction between all three.  It reflects those complexities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his advisers have noted <Col N="161" /> carefully the different themes which have emerged and will seriously consider the amendments being suggested, some of which make economic as well as social and personal sense for families.  It has been suggested, for example, that the age limit should be raised to eight years.  The question has been asked, since children generally attend pre-school at four years of age and primary school at five years of age, why should provision be made for parental leave up to the age of eight.  I would put it another way.  If there was more flexibility, parents could make better decisions.  It may not suit every family to take parental leave while children are under the age of five, even if we all believe that this is best.  The more flexibility we can build into the legislation the better it will be for employers and employees. I urge the Minister to consider where further flexibility can be built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State have rejected the suggestion that this is minimalist legislation.  However, in terms of the position of other EU member states on this issue, Ireland was one of the last three countries to introduce parental leave.  The Bill contains a number of good aspects, such as the credits and that time taken off will be allowed for reckonable purposes. They are most important provisions and I welcome them.  However, on the scale of parental leave schemes that are available, it is a relatively minimalist approach.  That no payment is involved means it will not be available to people who need it and would probably benefit most from it.  The recommendations of the Commission on the Family highlighted the importance of supports for vulnerable children and families.  If the benefits of parental leave are to reach those children, it must be feasible for people to take it.</P>
    <P>Funding is a difficult issue and employers have huge concerns about being faced with bills in this area.  When this type of legislation is discussed, Members tend to concentrate on the costs to employers as opposed to the advantages.  Ireland is facing a skills shortage.  Approximately 47 per cent of women are working and we will reach a position soon where good employers will provide paid parental leave and more child care facilities to keep employees.  This has happened in England and elsewhere and Ireland is probably moving in that direction in terms of good employment practice.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that if a workforce has good child care arrangements, it is more productive and contributes more to team spirit. There are huge advantages in that.  This is recognised in literature and increasingly on the ground. People tend to talk about the cost of these types of measures but we do not examine sufficiently the competitive advantages that good quality social legislation provides.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Asian tiger and what has happened to it, no child care provisions were made in that economy.  The economies which are performing best are those which have been generous in their support for child care facilities and <Col N="162" /> people who wish to combine work and family life. This model should drive us as much as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest these issues are simple.  They are complicated, but for a society which talks so much about valuing children and families and which establishes commissions on the status of women and the family which make major recommendations, a key issue is how people can be helped to combine work and family life.  How do we ensure there is good parenting and good child care practices?  All the reports have agreed that extensive parental leave is one aspect of that aim.</P>
    <P>Society values children and says it values the work of women in the home.  Many Deputies said society valued the contribution made by mothers in previous generations in unpaid work.  If that is the case, we must also value the opportunity that parental leave provides to society to be more supportive of families.  This is the key point.  If we want to be consistent in our values, giving parental leave in the most generous way possible is totally in line with the philosophy we say we espouse.  We should move as far as we can in the direction which other countries such as Sweden and Germany have taken.  This makes economic and social sense, but it also makes sense from a parenting point of view.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins mentioned a letter from a woman who is keen to take parental leave although her children are over the age limit.  She hoped there would be paid parental leave and one can sense her disappointment that she will not get the space with her children that she wants. Increasingly people are under such financial pressure that two jobs are essential.  Therefore, it is important to be as generous as possible with parental leave.  I hope the Minister will be more flexible regarding the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>From a child's perspective, people are pressurised in today's world.  The Bill is an opportunity to build in a little flexibility to the world of work and family life.  This is welcome.  I disagree completely with some speakers in the Seanad and some articles in newspapers who dismissed the Bill as irrelevant, unnecessary and flossy and who said it was an optional extra and it was outrageous that it is being implemented.  However, fundamental values are being expressed in the legislation about the type of society we want.  We are considering reality and acknowledging that women are increasingly involved in the workplace as well as family life.  The issue is how best to support women and men in being good parents in a changing world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill provides a new entitlement for men and women to avail of unpaid parental leave to enable them to take care of their young children.  The Bill incorporates EC Council Directive 96/34 of 3 June 1996 on the framework agreement on parental leave reached by UNICE, CEEP and the EPUC.  While the EU directive set certain minimum standards for parental leave, it also affords substantial discretion to each member <Col N="163" /> state regarding the components of its parental leave scheme.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Bill will apply to parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996.  Each parent will be entitled to a total of 14 weeks leave for a child, provided the leave is taken before the child reaches the age of five years.  Parental leave is not transferable from mother to father.  Therefore, the father cannot take the mother's share and <i>vice versa.</i>  The 14 weeks may be taken in one continuous block or in separate blocks by working reduced hours by agreement between employer and employee.  While parental leave is unpaid, at least it is recognisable for the purpose of employment rights other than superannuation. Limited <i>force majeure</i> leave, supported by a medical certificate, is encompassed in the Bill to overcome family crises.  Employers may postpone parental leave in certain circumstances and disputes about entitlements under the Bill will be in general referred to a rights commissioner.</P>
      <P>By and large the Bill is not as attractive as it appears.  There is no crock of gold at the end of the rainbow for parents who take parental leave. I cannot visualise a stampede of applicants to participate in the scheme.  There are no handouts for anybody concerned.  Every working mother is already entitled to maternity benefit and few couples could afford to take 14 weeks of unpaid parental leave.  Even the <i>force majeure</i> leave is curtailed to a maximum of three days in 12 consecutive months or five days in 36 consecutive months.  This is not such a big deal after all.</P>
      <P>It is fine for the EU to issue directives, but they should be backed up with finance.  The pressure to make loan repayments make it necessary for both parents to work.  Créches and babysitters are readily available, but at an exorbitant cost.  Those facilities also have disadvantages, as children naturally need their parents, particularly their mothers, during their tender years.  The saying &ldquo;a mother's love is a blessing&rdquo; will never be forgotten by children who are reared in a home where a mother can give them care and attention.</P>
      <P>If the Government introduced a scheme giving husbands a 100 per cent tax free allowance on their earnings, it would be an incentive to the mother to relinquish her employment and mind her family while they are young.  This would create a job for someone else.  I am very critical of this Bill; there will be no stampede to avail of its provisions.  What parents &mdash; except the very rich &mdash; can afford to spend 14 weeks at home without receiving a penny?  EU directives are fine, but does the EU realise that if these directives are to be imposed on member states they must be backed up by finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is not worth £1 to the parents concerned. There is glamour associated with its introduction, but fine words butter no bread for those concerned.  The one redeeming feature of the Bill is the right of both parents to avail of unpaid parental leave with the knowledge that their jobs await them at the end of that leave if, according <Col N="164" /> to the Bill, other unforeseen obstacles do not arise.  I refer the Minister to section 16, which states that where an employee is entitled to return to work pursuant to section 15, but it is not reasonably practicable for the employer to permit the employee to return to work in accordance with that section, the employee shall be entitled to be offered by his or her employer suitable alternative employment under a new contract of employment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain how this will happen if the employer goes into liquidation or if the job is not suitable for the person on leave?  The Minister is opening a can of worms it will be very difficult to close.  I ask him to think again before introducing a Bill which is not worth a tráithnín to those concerned.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle. We must accept that we are part of the European Union.  Some people like to pick out aspects of Europe to condemn, refusing to accept many good things we have because of our involvement in the EU.  Some homes still have many difficulties, but I remind Members of the difficulties experienced in rural Ireland, especially where there were no incomes, before we entered the EEC in 1973.  Things were very different from today.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives parents certain rights, such as 14 weeks' leave for both father and mother to stay at home at different times, separate from maternity leave.  That gives an opportunity to parents to become closer to their children.  Deputy Neville referred to the high percentage of children born out of wedlock, but we must still encourage families which want to act like families with the true Christian attitudes we are advised to follow, where the father, mother and children all live at home.  We must try to allow parents to be with younger children in particular for as long as possible, and this Bill does try to do so.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, in most families, both parents must work and this is partly a result of the lack of effort by successive Governments in trying to keep house prices at realistic levels.  Young couples must pay between £80,000 and £120,000 for a simple home, and both of them will have to work for the foreseeable future.  We must look at giving some form of help to the parent who stays at home to create a proper environment for children, as has been suggested in the past.  Many children are brought up by nannies and in créches, but the best possible home life is one where one parent spends time with the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take into account the effect of this legislation on small industries.  The Minister said it was impossible to get agreement between industry and the trade unions.  One can see how <Col N="165" /> much the workforce depends on small industry in my constituency, and one can only imagine how the family which owns a small business will cope with workers being off work for 14 weeks.  Even though those workers will be unpaid, it begs the question of how this legislation will operate. Thought will have to be given to how small industries can continue in business if this is implemented.</P>
    <P>I know this matter was under review before the Minister came into office, and it is a difficult one to address, but some degree of support should be given to one of the parents in order that he or she can stay at home for a continuous period.  The employer can then plan an approach whereby somebody else can fill in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neville referred to the fact that 25 per cent of children born in Dundalk have single parents. A single mother gets a lone parent's allowance and a rent allowance if she lives in a rented flat.  However, a married couple do not get anything. A couple came to my clinic the other day wondering whether they should have taken vows or whether they would have been better off if they had done things differently.  It is sad that a couple with a new baby who are blissfully happy in many ways should have to ask that.  He earns £12,500 a year, which is taxable.  He has to pay £50 for a two-roomed flat, the walls of which are damp.  To heat it with an electric heater costs a bomb, and there is no other form of heating.  How could he afford to take 14 weeks unpaid leave to be part of that family unit?</P>
    <P>There are many difficulties with this Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister has to work within the directive, but if we are genuinely committed to maintaining as many children as possible within a proper family structure, we have to level the playing pitch.  The county council is about to allocate houses in Monaghan town.  For all sorts of reasons, it is much more likely that single parent families will get houses than that the young couple I mentioned will get one.</P>
    <P>The Bill is part of our involvement in the EU. We can work it in our best interests or in the worst possible way.  The Minister has shown that he is prepared to implement it in the best possible way, but without some degree of Government support for families like the couple I mentioned to allow them to have rights at least equal to those who do not choose to go that way, this Bill could have disastrous effects, particularly for small businesses.  However, as it stands I support it.</P>

Ach ní féidir an óige a mholadh mura mbíonn daoine i láthair sa teach leo nuair a bhíonn siad an-óg, agus de réir dealraimh tá an Bille seo ag cabhrú chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Ach deirim de réir dealraimh mar i ndáiríre an mar sin atá an scéal?  Ní dóigh liom gur mar sin atá an scéal. Sílim gur sort dallamullóg atá á chur orainn, agus <Col N="166" /> nuair a bheidh gach éinne in a bhfuascailt, beidh scéal eile ann.  Sílim fhéin pé scéal é.</P>
      <P>The Bill means well, but it is the kind of Bill one would find in Utopia.  Even in a booming economy commonsense must prevail.  We must be wise enough to look to the future when, on the law of averages, we will have moved from the boom to where we will not be doing nearly as well.  It is important that parents should be able to look after children when they are young, and despite this being the age of equality I still think mothers have much more to give to younger children than have fathers.  It is their natural instinct with which nature provides them.  It does not mean that fathers can bypass their responsibilities and leave it all to mothers to look after children. However, no matter how well-meaning they are they do not have the same scope as mothers.</P>
      <P>What does this Bill really mean?  What percentage of the workforce can do without 14 weeks pay?  It is such a small percentage that one would not bother working it out.  If they can afford that, they can afford to pay for services that can compensate for their absence.  It would make far more sense to extend maternity leave with pay.  It would also be important, if the mother of a new baby were seriously ill, that a father would be given leave of absence with pay.  Martin Luther King had a genuine dream, but this Bill is the kind of dream that deals with unreality.  The people who want to avail of it cannot afford to do so.</P>
      <P>If we were to take the next step and provide that people would be given paid leave and that business would have to pay, that would create another problem.  We would need an almighty boom in the economy if business people were to be able to pay a double salary for 14 weeks. We can dream all we like, but that is the reality. What is being proposed will not benefit anybody. It does not make sense to provide that those who want to take 14 weeks will be paid because most firms could not afford it.  The point has been made already that people who work for the Civil Service may be able to get this kind of money, but there is a limit to what taxpayers can be asked to pay.  Nobody would be able to get this leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see more support for families.  It is vital that children should grow up in a situation where they have care.  It should not follow that only the mother will give that care.  We need to come up with a better idea than giving 14 weeks leave, with or without pay, to a father who may want to avail of it.  The Minister should seriously consider extra leave with pay for the mother on the birth of a child or if someone is sick.  There will be cases where that will be vital.  A global extension of leave does not make sense.  The previous speaker said it made economic sense.  I take the opposite line and say that it is economic nonsense. Good intentions are not enough.  EU directives that are pie in the sky will do nothing for mothers or fathers or for business people. <Col N="167" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions.  I have listened to divergent views, and it has been a most stimulating debate, worthy of a Bill such as this which is pioneering legislation.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the Deputies' points as far as I can.  The Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Jim Higgins suggested that we failed to meet the deadline set by the directive.  He misses the point that the directive allowed for an additional year in the case of special difficulties. The EU Commission has confirmed that we will be fully in compliance with the directive if parental leave is in place by 3 December 1998.  This is in recognition of the fact that parental leave is a new concept in this country and, as I outlined, it is our intention to have this legislation in place on 3 December 1998.  There is no mystery about the reason for that.  We wanted to give employers the opportunity of learning about the legislation, knowing that it is in place, and thereby having the opportunity to plan for the date of its implementation. That was a reasonable approach to take and fair to employers.</P>
      <P>Some have argued that employers should have been aware of the directive.  It is true that the directive was adopted on 3 June 1996 but it must be recognised that its provisions were not directly transposed into Irish law.  A degree of discretion in relation to various matters was allowed for and those opportunities were taken.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins also criticised the fact that we did not provide for full retrospection, in other words, that we applied parental leave only to children born after 3 June 1996.  It is important that a degree of discretion in the implementation of the directive was conferred on the member states. We were not obliged, under the directive, to provide for any retrospection.  We also had strong views from IBEC that there should not be any retrospection.  IBEC was seriously concerned that any retrospection would impose an undue burden on employers in the first year of the scheme's operation because of the backlog of eligible children. We put in place a compromise in regard to the views of IBEC, the expectations of parents and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>A difficult balance had to be achieved throughout this legislation &mdash; the balance between the trade union movement on the one hand and employers on the other, always recognising the rights of parents and the needs of children.  That is a difficult balance to achieve but in so far as we could achieve it, given the complexities of what we faced, we have succeeded to a degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked why section 13, the <i>force majeure</i> leave, refers to illness or injury while the directive uses the words &ldquo;sickness or accident&rdquo;.  We included the word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman because the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; was imprecise and could cover a host of other situations.  For example, a traffic accident which delayed rather than injured a family member or an accident which obliged <Col N="168" /> somebody to wait for a plumber or an electrician are not the types of incidents envisaged by <i>force majeure</i> leave.  The word &ldquo;injury&rdquo; covers an injury resulting from an accident and does not bring in the other looser situations which would be covered if we used the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the wording of the legislation as presented is in full compliance with the directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan also questioned the reason the introduction of the scheme should be deferred until 3 December 1998.  I have explained the reason for that and I believe the interval is essential.  Parental leave is new to the country and practicalities will have to be worked out by employers before the scheme commences.  IBEC pressed strongly for the legislation to be postponed until June 1999 because it believed there was an insufficiency of time for its members and employers generally.  I had to strike a balance and by providing for the legislation to come into operation on 3 December, we have managed to strike the correct balance.</P>
    <P>The directive offers little guidance to employers.  The delay until December will give employer organisations the opportunity to advise their members who can then plan ahead with some confidence.  Obviously systems will have to be put in place for operating the scheme at the level of the individual workplace, which is where it must be operated.  Government Departments also will have to get used to the scheme and put measures in place for its successful operation.  It may be accepted by Deputies that the delay, which is minimal but necessary, is reasonable.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and O'Sullivan raised the question of providing a payment for parental leave.  I must emphasise there is no obligation on member states to provide paid leave within the meaning of the directive.  Costings prepared by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs estimate that if paid on the same basis as maternity leave, parental leave would cost in the region of £40 million per year.  That figure is based upon a 95 per cent take-up by women and a low take-up by men, in the region of 1 per cent, which is the take-up figure in Germany where the leave is paid.</P>
    <P>That raises the question whether leave being paid or unpaid increases the attractiveness of the scheme to men.  The argument could be made that the take-up by men in Germany might be replicated here, although we do not have any way of determining that.  The £40 million estimate is based on a take-up of 10 per cent of men.  The take-up in Germany is as I have outlined.  If all men and women who are eligible to take up leave availed of it, the cost could be as high as £100 million per annum.  That figure covers only employers who pay full PRSI.  There would be extra costs for civil servants and other public servants who do not pay full PRSI, and the Department of Finance estimates this extra cost could be in the region of £30 million per annum.  Those figures will, perhaps, surprise some Members, but <Col N="169" /> I am reliably informed that, based upon the percentages I have outlined, they are correct.</P>
    <P>Deputies Higgins and O'Sullivan raised the question of age limit of the child.  Deputy Higgins stated definitively that other EU states have an upper age limit of eight years.  I do not know where the Deputy got that information or whether he is being over-enthusiastic and over-exuberant because according to the information available to me, only Denmark and Sweden have an upper age limit of eight years.  Most other countries set the limit at about three years.  The directive allowed us to set the age limit at between two and eight years, and I picked five.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We were trying to strike the correct balance.  It is not because there are five fingers on one hand but because in general terms the school-going age is five &mdash; many children start school at four.  In those circumstances, and since most European states have set the age limit at about three years, we have gone beyond the EU norm.  That is an illustration that we are not minimalist in our approach.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan referred to a Labour Party amendment in the Seanad on the provision of information to the public about the parental leave scheme.  I agreed to consider that matter and it is my intention to move an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage to deal with the constructive criticism made in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn made the point that the question of unpaid leave should be left open in the legislation, that the legislation should remain neutral in that respect.  He asked that the option be left open to an employer to pay the employee during parental leave if the employer wishes to do so.  While I do not propose to oblige an employer to pay an employee who is on parental leave, I do not intend that the Bill should preclude such payment.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions suggested that the Bill should be neutral in that respect and that if there are future negotiations concerning the question of social partnership, as no doubt there will be, the opportunity should be left open to, at the very least, discuss this question.  I am considering the Bill closely and it is my intention to ensure it is neutral so that future options can be explored without there being a legislative or statutory prohibition in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy McManus, in a characteristic contribution, stated that the Bill is minimalist and that it does not rock any boat.  I reject emphatically her description of the Bill as minimalist or conservative. The Bill will provide a fundamental right to employees.  For the first time, employees will be able to take time off work to care for their children.  Let us be fair and honest, this is a major change in Irish working life and Members should not be begrudging of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill goes beyond the minimum required by <Col N="170" /> the directive.  It sets the age limit at five, and I have outlined why that is not a minimalist provision. In setting that age limit, we have out-flanked most European states which have set the age at three.  We have allowed for leave on a flexible basis, which is different from the way most European Union member states legislated.  We made parental leave reckonable for annual increments and other service.  That is by no means a minimalist move nor could it be described as such.  Employer organisations were not pleased with that proposal.  We made the leave reckonable for the purposes of long-term and short-term social welfare benefits, and that is not a minimalist provision.  We allowed retrospection to 3 June 1996 when we could have allowed eligibility only for children born after 3 June 1998.  This Bill is neither minimalist nor conservative.</P>
    <P>This is pioneering legislation.  It is imaginative, innovative and progressive.  It interprets the directive in a refreshing and liberal manner.  It should be borne in mind that since the Bill has been published we have faced criticisms not only from employees' organisations but from employers' organisations.  Employers have voiced concerns about the cost implications of the scheme and have stated emphatically that we have gone too far in our interpretation of the directive.  On the other side of that coin, we were criticised by the ICTU and we had to try to strike a balance.  There was no foot dragging or old fashioned thinking.  Anybody who believes the legislation represents any of those epithets is not living on this planet.  Deputy McManus referred to the philosophy behind the legislation as being the same as that which underlies the issue of illegal immigration.  When I asked the Deputy at a committee recently to name a country which had abandoned all its immigration laws, I received no reply.  I do not take that criticism seriously &mdash; nobody could.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt asked that we consider the transfer of leave from one parent to the other at a future stage.  The legislation, as it stands, forbids the father transfering leave to the mother or <i>vice versa.</i>  The directive provides that parental leave should, in principle, be non-transferable between parents.  The idea behind this non-transferability is to prevent parental leave from becoming solely a women's issue.  Experience in other countries, such as Sweden, as Deputy Hanafin pointed out, shows that where transfer between parents is allowed, the traffic is almost invariably one way &mdash; from men to women.  That is not the intention of this legislation.  It is a recognition of the joint responsibility of both parents and seeks to enshrine in law a facility or mechanism so that both parents have the opportunity to exercise that responsibility.  I note Deputy Hanafin's comments on the desirability of non-transferability. She identifies clearly why the legislation should not provide for transfer of parental leave between father and mother and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>I noted Deputy O'Sullivan's comments on the <Col N="171" /> possibility of abuse of <i>force majeure</i> leave and I agree with her the Bill will allow parents to be up front about taking leave for family crises instead of pretending they are sick.  Most people do not want to pretend they are sick in the event of a family crisis but have no alternative under current legislation.  This Bill gives them the opportunity to take leave.  It should be noted that leave in this instance is paid.</P>
    <P>The employer organisations would not be in favour of paid leave, although the trade union movement, the Irish Congress of Trades Union, would want all leave to be paid.  One must strike a balance within the context of the resources available.  The <i>force majeure</i> leave provisions are not an opening for extra holidays for employees but are a recognition that family crises arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>The inequality between workers in the home and employees is an important point raised by Deputy Finucane, who was by no means at sea despite his protestations to the contrary.  He made a very interesting point about the implications of providing social welfare benefits or enhanced benefits to people on parental leave.  He mentioned that such payments might create inequalities <i>vis-à-vis</i> parents who do not work outside the home.  That is a valid issue to raise and is one which must be borne in mind in the debate on payment for <i>force majeure</i> leave.  Deputy Finucane's comments illustrate the need to take account of the range of interests, not to mention the costs involved in parental leave, and not to look at this issue from one perspective only.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelleher dealt with the possibility of abuse of parental leave and wanted to know how it would be monitored.  It would not be realistic to have an inspectorate policing how employees use parental leave.  We stipulated in the Bill that it must be used to take care of the child.  Section 12 provides that an employer may terminate parental leave if it is being abused and may refuse leave altogether where he or she has reasonable grounds to believe it will be abused.  There is also provision in section 27 which obliges the employer to keep records of parental and <i>force majeure</i> leave.  These records will help guard against abuse, particularly by employees who change jobs.  I have taken note of suggestions from IBEC about centralised monitoring of parental and <i>force majeure</i> leave.  In conjunction with other Departments, I am examining how this might be done in a practical way.  There will be an opportunity to look again at this issue when the legislation is reviewed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes raised the issue of providing a small amount of paternity leave for fathers.  This is a separate issue from parental leave.  We are legally obliged to treat men and women equally in transposing the parental leave directive into Irish law and we could not provide paternity leave as part of parental leave.  Paternity leave is a different issue for another day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring commented on the undesirability <Col N="172" /> of the principle of the Bill.  He referred, in his usual colourful manner, to the raft of legislation from Europe and the adverse impact on employers of such legislation.  While I would not favour the Germanisation of Ireland there have been some valuable regulations and directives from Europe which have benefited the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill recognises the reality of modern life and does no more or no less.  I am not qualified to lecture Deputy Ring but the reality it addresses is that over 40 per cent of the workforce are women.  Many women prefer to work and feel perfectly capable of minding their children.  That is the position.  Deputy Ring also said this Bill was only about women minding children.  This Bill is not for women alone, it is for both parents to help them to share in the upbringing of their children.</P>

      <P>Had Deputy Ring allowed me to finish my point there would have been no need for him to interrupt in the first instance.  The comments by Deputy Ring in this respect support the general point about seeking balance in bringing in this measure.  We have to look at the whole situation in the round and balance all the issues and the interests involved.  I feel sure the Deputy will accept that in good faith.</P>
      <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald referred to the whole question of paid leave and expressing in legislation the values which the State espouses. Much of the debate has focused on the issue of whether parental leave should be paid and to what extent it addresses the needs of parents in a changing society and in the altered world of work today.</P>
      <P>I have not, for the reasons explained, made provision in this legislation for paid leave but I stress this legislation is a pioneering measure.  It is different from any previous legislation in many respects.  It is different in that it does not just address the question of the mother and child rearing, it addresses also the question of the father and child rearing.  Ten or 15 years ago legislation such as this would not have been expected. Neither could it have been anticipated that women would participate in the workplace to the extent they do today.  It could not have been imagined there would be statutory provision for parental leave.  Earlier I described this as a pioneering measure.  It is impossible in the context of recent history, or one's interpretation of it, to say how this measure will have developed in ten years' time.  However, I am certain it will have developed because all the trends are in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan asked about section 16 which gives the employee the right to return to employment. <Col N="174" /> He said it was impractical for the employee to be offered the job he or she had before going on parental leave and in that event asked what would happen.  This section is the same as the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995, and the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  Obviously, if a firm goes into liquidation and there is a redundancy the employer would not be obliged to take the employee back.  In any event these situations are provided for by other legislation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the legislation has succeeded in stimulating the level of debate it has.  There were some very interesting contributions and the legislation will be all the better for it.  When it is ultimately interpreted by the courts, this debate will have provided an invaluable insight into what the Oireachtas thought of the measure.  There were varying and divergent views but, in the final analysis, the Parental Leave Bill, 1998, will be a milestone, not just in the evolution of labour law in Ireland, but in the evolution of society.  It represents a benchmark and also a signpost to the future.  It is indicative of how we have matured as a society and reflects society's complexity.  It also recognises why we must continue to progress in innovative and imaginative ways which recognise the importance of equal responsibility in all our affairs.</P>

      <P>We are all aware of the serious situation developing in this area.  In examining the various local authority house building programmes in the greater Dublin area over the past 20 or 30 years, one recognises the achievement of the provision of substantial numbers of houses, flats, etc., and also the difficulties which arose from having provided houses in such large numbers. Such volumes of housing was provided because there was a necessity to clear the overcrowded slums in the centre of Dublin.  Previous Governments built Drimnagh, Kimmage, Crumlin, Cabra and Ballyfermot.  It was then felt there was too great an intensity of local authority housing in specific areas which brought with it certain social problems.</P>
      <P>The next phase of addressing the housing crisis was the construction of Ballymun and the development of new satellite towns, two of which I have had the responsibility of representing since first being elected to the House in the late 1970s. Three of these satellite towns were Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown.  In another, Tallaght, it was intended to accommodate 100,000 people, a substantial percentage of whom was to be housed in local authority accommodation.</P>
      <P>We repeatedly address the problems which arise from having provided substantial and large numbers of local authority houses, especially social problems.  North Clondalkin was the first ever area which needed a report from a task force on urban crime.  We do not want to repeat past mistakes and thus do not provide such large volumes of local authority housing.  As a result, in the area about which I am concerned, the Eastern Health Board enters the equation.  It gives subsidies to people renting accommodation and who are on the local authority housing list.</P>
      <P>The market driven cost of rents is soaring and persons or families on low or fixed incomes, such as welfare recipients, are finding it impossible to secure suitable accommodation.  Accommodation within their means tends to be of poor quality and of insecure tenure.  This inability to find accommodation leads to overcrowding in local authority dwellings where young people cannot afford to move out of the family home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board provides rental subsidies but rapidly rising market costs in the private sector mean the subsidies increasingly lag behind.  Indicative of these rental costs would be the Eastern Health Board Area 1 where market costs run from £550 to £600 per month and the subsidy runs at £350 to £400 per month.  Area 2 has market costs from £450 to £500 and the subsidy <Col N="176" /> is £300 to £380 per month.  The subsidies cited are the maximum available and they vary from area to area.  The subsidy system is tied into area rental costs and not to family needs and there is an increasing use of bed and breakfasts and hostel accommodation which is very unsatisfactory, particularly for mothers with young children. Annual outgoings are of the order of £100 million per annum of which the Eastern Health Board caters for about £40 million and about 16,500 cases.  The public housing list is running nationally at about 31,000 and it is about 10,000 in Dublin.</P>
    <P>While the Celtic tiger and all that goes with it is laudable and progressive, we will probably be judged at the end of this Government's term on our response to social needs and requirements.  I hope we will be in a position to address it under a number of headings.  There is no doubt the recent Bacon report was an attempt to address a specific aspect of the housing problem but not this one. The general reaction was that the recommendations of the report would mean growing problems in the rental sector.  It is a problem I encounter every weekend at advice centres and I sincerely hope the Minister can address the issue and decide how to tackle this growing social problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to this matter.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at reports of rent increases and shortages of private rented accommodation, especially in the Dublin area.  A range of factors is at work, including the recent increases in house prices and values and the growing numbers of asylum seekers who must be accommodated in the private rented sector.</P>
      <P>One factor which has tended to place additional pressure on the private rented sector in the recent past is that some prospective first time house buyers have been forced to remain in rented accommodation because of the difficulty they faced in purchasing houses.  The overall package of measures which the Government has implemented to address the issue of house prices, as set out in its Action on House Prices, will benefit lower income buyers by helping to dampen price increases and restore better balance between supply and demand.  These measures will help many households who had no option but to remain in rented accommodation to purchase their own house which, in turn, will help to relieve some pressure on the private rented sector.  They should, together with the likely further reductions in interest rates, have a positive impact on the supply and cost of housing for renting generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The SWA rent supplementation scheme is governed by the Social Welfare Acts and administered by the health boards subject to overall direction, regulation and funding of the scheme by the Department of Social, Community and <Col N="177" /> Family Affairs.  Health boards determine at the direction of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, appropriate maximum rent levels, in respect of which rent supplement is payable, having regard to the family circumstances and location of the residence.  Rent levels for the purposes of the scheme in respect of accommodation for various categories of households, are set by the health boards using local knowledge of reasonable rents for private accommodation.  I understand that increased rent levels were set earlier this year by the Eastern Health Board, involving increases ranging up to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The large numbers of asylum seekers in the Dublin area has increased the pressure on the supply of private rented and emergency bed and breakfast accommodation.  Under international agreements, the host state is responsible for providing for the needs of asylum seekers, including accommodation, while their applications for asylum are being determined.  The processing of applications can take some time.  While the procedures have been put in place by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with the situation, there is likely to be little impact on the overall numbers in the short-term.</P>
    <P>This also impacts on the availability of accommodation &mdash; private rented and emergency &mdash; for other homeless people in the area.  Partly as a consequence, the emergency hostels for homeless people in the area are generally full and the voluntary bodies which operate this accommodation and the Eastern Health Board which arranges emergency accommodation for homeless people, are having difficulty in meeting demand.  Dublin Corporation and the Dublin Homeless Initiative are addressing this problem by placing increased emphasis on settlement measures to move homeless people out of hostels and identifying and making arrangements with operators of bed and breakfast premises to provide a consistent flow of emergency accommodation for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>The Action Programme for the Millennium sets out the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  A programme of 3,900 housing starts and acquisitions has been notified to local authorities for 1998.  The capital provision of some £213 million is 19 per cent up on last year and authorities in the Dublin region received £72 million &mdash; including £20 million for the redevelopment of Ballymun.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the housing programme, taken with the output from complementary social housing measures and vacancies in the existing local authority housing stock, will enable the needs of some 10,000 households to be catered for in 1998, about one third of whom would be in the Dublin area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this matter and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  I extend <Col N="178" /> my best wishes to the Minister and his staff.  I was sorry to hear of the fire and was glad that no one was injured.  I compliment the fire service on the wonderful job they did to save public and private property.</P>
      <P>This matter is a major issue in the Carrowkennedy area.  It is an area which was the location of a famous ambush.  Many well known people came from the area, including the parents of former Minister Jim Tunney.  If he was in the House I am sure he would support this request for an extra classroom for Carrowkennedy national school.</P>
      <P>There will be 14 extra students starting in the school this year and only three leaving to go on to second level education.  The total number of students will be 59 in September.  The numbers have increased and the school is entitled to a third teacher.  However, there is only classroom accommodation for two teachers and the classrooms are badly overcrowded.  In September one teacher will have to teach 35 children in a room which can only accommodate half that number.  All but the basic furniture has to be taken out to accommodate the students.  The extra room, which is used as an office, will now have to be used as a computer room.</P>
      <P>This area is three to four miles outside Westport. It is a good news story.  Deputies are always looking for extra teachers because the numbers are falling.  In this case the numbers are increasing. Many of the parents work in Westport but they want their children to be educated in Carrowkennedy. This is a reasonable request.  Fifteen extra students are coming into the school and it is entitled to an extra teacher but there are only two classrooms.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State has good news for the school.  There is talk of building a prefab. However, this is an isolated area situated in open countryside.  A prefab would not withstand bad weather and I have no doubt it would be blown away and could be dangerous for children.</P>
      <P>The Department should sanction the extra room and make sure that a stone building is constructed. It is important that the Minister of State makes the announcement quickly so that construction can commence.  It would be unreasonable to request that it be ready by September but if it was sanctioned now it could be ready before Christmas.</P>
      <P>This school is not like others which expect to maintain teacher levels while student numbers decline.  The numbers are going up in the area and many new houses are being built.  This will cause a further problem down the road.  I hope the Minister of State has positive news.  His officials will give him the usual line.  However, he is a rural man and he has an understanding of rural life and schools.  These teachers are working under difficult circumstances and I compliment them for an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who have come to Westport and the area have done well over the years.  There is a fine standard of teaching and the parents want their children to be educated in the area.  They do <Col N="179" /> not want to have to bring their children elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Property in Westport has become expensive as a result of the pilot scheme.  People cannot afford to buy property in the town and they are looking to outlying areas and building houses. They are prepared to work in Westport and Castlebar but they want their children taught locally.  I hope the Minister of State will grant the extra classroom and ensure that a stone building is constructed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his generous comments to the Minister and staff in the Department.  We are delighted that no one was injured in the fire and that property has been saved.  Hopefully things will soon return to normal.  It is obvious that the Celtic tiger has been moving in the Westport-Carrowkennedy area and we have to take cognisance of that situation.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining the Department's position regarding accommodation at Carrowkennedy national school.  I am aware that this school has a staffing level of a principal, one assistant and a shared remedial teacher.  The current accommodation in the school consists of two permanent classrooms with sanitary facilities.  These classrooms are undersized according to normal Department standards.</P>
      <P>An application for the provision of a third classroom was received from the school management in April 1998 to alleviate overcrowding. A member of the Department's architectural staff visited the school recently and his report is currently being evaluated by the building unit which was destroyed in this morning's fire.  However, we are confident that all the files have been saved.</P>
      <P>As with all applications for additional accommodation, the Department's planning unit has been requested to examine the projected enrolments for the school to assess the long-term accommodation requirements.  This process is ongoing and the board of management has been made aware of this.</P>
      <P>The architectural report will be considered in conjunction with the planning unit's report.  I endorse the Deputy's comments that this is a positive, progressive school.  It has an excellent teaching standard and a happy educational environment. The Deputy, parents, teachers and the board require that we continue with a conventional extension to the school rather than any other type of structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give special recommendation to this project and ask for an immediate detailed analysis. We will try to make a decision as quickly as possible. When this has been completed the Minister for Education and Science will then be in a position to consider how best to address the school's accommodation needs. <Col N="180" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to a two teacher school in Ballybunion originally constructed in l957 and there have been no changes or extensions to the building since then.  The total student population is 53.  There are eight classes housed in two classrooms.  There are 27 children in the senior level and 26 at the lower level.  This arrangement is coming under increasing strain.  By next year there will not be enough room in the senior room to accommodate all the children.  There is no facility for remedial teaching and children requiring remedial teaching are currently accommodated in a converted coalhouse.  There are no proper facilities for the photocopier or office accommodation.  There are no facilities outside the two classrooms for art, physical education, library, music or accommodation of new technologies such as computers.  The proposal is to construct an extension to the school of an internal dimension of 5.5 metres by 6.4 metres at an estimated miserly cost of £20,000.</P>
      <P>The two classrooms are divided by a wooden partition which is not sound proof and this causes difficulties for the teachers in both rooms.  An all-purpose room, as proposed, would allow the school provide facilities to cope with present day educational requirements.  However, in the short-term the proposed extension would be used by the junior classes.  This would allow senior classes with the larger numbers and bigger children to use both rooms in the school.  The present senior room is inadequate to cater for the increased numbers projected for the next four to five years.</P>
      <P>Even when the school numbers decrease, the proposed extension can revert to an all-purpose room.  The increased space will allow teachers to avail of improved facilities in art work, physical education programmes, library facilities, music provision and computers.  It would be impossible to find space in either room for the proposed computer facilities envisaged in future education plans.</P>
      <P>A letter I received from the principal of the school, Anne O'Dowd, states:</P>
      <P>In my teaching career in S.N. Cill Conla, I have had the pleasure of seeing the students succeed in secondary school and 95% of them have achieved third level education.  6th class students have left this school with an excellent standard of education and were highly motivated towards future education.  It is with great joy that I meet them as they return from many parts of the world successful and fulfilled with their lives.</P>
      <P>However, there is a change.  At present in my classroom I have 27 children.  They are distributed between four classes &mdash; 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th.  In 3rd and 4th classes there are 16 children. We have had to change from the bright modern group setting of furniture to 2nd hand desks where children sit in straight rows for 5 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They cannot move freely in the classroom to use the educational equipment that I have acquired during the years.  They do not have free access to the class library.  This is of necessity <Col N="181" /> pinned in by tables.  Many of the books have to be stored in plastic boxes.  All past students have left this school having read most children's classics and with a love of reading.</P>
    <P>I have to impose strict discipline code in class.  I am doing 4 different programmes in maths and a minimum of 2 programmes in all other subjects.  At no stage in class can any student work in silence.  At all times each student is subjected to noise levels from whatever class I am working with.  They are subjected to noise from the four classes next door as there is only a wooden partition separating both rooms.  This is the equivalent of studying with radios on!</P>
    <P>The results are obvious.  I am worried that this year and for future years the standard of education of the students leaving this school will be lower.  I cannot give each or any child the time they require.  With children with learning difficulties these difficulties become more acute, through lack of space to reach them, lack of time and attention and lack of support from their peers.</P>
    <P>The concentration level of the students is deteriorating.  This comes from the noise level operating within the room.</P>
    <P>Children are becoming heedless because they are further removed when I am working with them.  When I could group children I was always close to each child.  Now because they are in rows I cannot get to the bottom of the row.  They are too far removed from me and the blackboard.</P>
    <P>Children cannot express themselves.  I have always encouraged children to express themselves freely.  Because of the overcrowding I cannot give time for this necessary activity.  The result is that children are once more repressing their feelings and ideas.</P>
    <P>In view of the sentiments expressed by Anne O'Dowd, I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure that work starts immediately on this school.  I would appreciate if he could take a personal interest in the matter.</P>

      <P>This matter gives me an opportunity to clarify the position in relation to the school.  Kilconly National School, Ballybunion, County Kerry is a co-educational school with an enrolment of 53 pupils in the current school year. The staffing consists of a principal plus one assist ant teacher.  In addition, the school has a shared remedial teacher.  The current staffing level will remain unaltered for the 1998-9 school year. Accommodation at the school consists of two permanent classrooms, and a small room which was converted to cater for remedial tuition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July 1995 an application was received from the school authorities requesting an improvement in classroom accommodation, staff room, medical and library facilities.  Following the normal procedures in a case of this type, the school's request was forwarded to the local school inspector for a report.  The inspector concluded that the existing <Col N="182" /> classrooms were not to a modern standard and did not provide adequate space for modern requirements.  The inspector recommended the provision of an additional classroom at the school and upgrading of the existing accommodation to provide one classroom and one room suitable for library and medical inspections.</P>
    <P>This recommendation was accepted by our Department's planning and building unit and a technical assessment of the school building was organised to determine the exact nature of the works required.  However, due to the level of commitments at the time and restrictions on capital spending, it was not possible to approve the project.</P>
    <P>The position is that the planning section of our Department is reviewing the accommodation requirements of the school.  The review is currently under way and when completed, our Department will make further contact with the school management.  I will keep the Deputy informed of developments on this issue because it is a serious matter.</P>

      <P>This child has not been able to attend school since last November when she was withdrawn from Scoil Colmcille in Ballybrack, following a meeting between the child's mother, the school principal and I understand a Department inspector.</P>
      <P>The child commenced her primary education in Archbishop McQuaid junior school in Loughlinstown, the closest school to her.  Her performance was psychologically reviewed at intervals by the Eastern Health Board since she started school. This review displayed evidence of developmental delay.  She then attended a special class in the Dominican Convent primary school in Dun Laoghaire from September l993 until June l995. The report of the Eastern Health Board's psychologist states:</P>
      <P>A cognitive review here in June l995 indicated lower extreme Mild Learning Disability. [The child] commenced special class placement in Scoil Colmcille Senior N.S. in September l997 and her teachers recently requested a review.  As her parents were anxious to secure a placement for [the child] in St. Augustine's School, Blackrock, Dr Mary Nugent assessed her there on the 24th November l997.  Results of cognitive testing revealed a Moderate Learning Disability and placement in St. Augustine's was considered to be inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this the child experienced some unwelcome attention from other children and it was felt at the meeting between her mother, the school principal and the departmental inspector that the best course was to withdraw her from the school, which happened last November.  Since then the child's parents have been attempting to get a placement for her in another school.  Initially they succeeded in getting a promise of a placement in <Col N="183" /> St. Catherine's special school in Newcastle, County Wicklow.  However, the child had no transport to the school.  There is a bus from Bray to Newcastle, but the parents did not have transport from their home in Loughlinstown to Bray.</P>
    <P>On 10 March I wrote to the Minister seeking school transport for the child.  Following this St. Catherine's special school notified the parents that a place was not available for the child.  I wrote to the Minister on 24 March pointing this out and seeking assistance in ensuring the child could be placed in a school which was appropriate to her needs and acceptable to her parents.  I again wrote to the Minister on 23 April and the letter was acknowledged on 11 May.</P>
    <P>As we approach the end of June the situation is that the parents, who have been teaching the child at home and doing their best to keep her education up-to-date, are extremely concerned about getting a placement for her in an appropriate school or class which is acceptable to them and to which there is transport.  They are particularly anxious that such a placement should be arranged for her by next September.  They have asked St. Augustine's school to reconsider its decision not to place her there.  The assistance of the Department is required.  It is unreasonable and unfair that the child has not been able to attend school since last November.  The parents are to be greatly commended for their efforts in keeping the child's education up-to-date and for doing the best they can in the circumstances. However, this situation obviously cannot continue. The child will need normal, proper and appropriate schooling and I ask the Minister to intervene and ensure the resources of the Department are made available to secure a placement for the child so that she can continue her education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The child in question is ten years of age and has been assessed as having a moderate mental handicap.  She lives in the catchment area for St. Michael's House special school, Grosvenor Road, Dublin 6, which caters for children with a moderate mental handicap.  I understand the child's mother approached the school in January 1998 with a view to enrolling the child and that it was intended that the child would commence in the school after the Easter holidays of this year.  Transport to and from the school could have been provided.  However, the family contacted <Col N="184" /> St. Michael's House and advised that the child would not be enrolling.</P>
      <P>I understand the parents of the child want to enrol her in St. Catherine's special school, Newcastle, County Wicklow, which is also a school for moderately mentally handicapped pupils.  This school has advised our Department that it has not offered the child a place.  The school does not have vacancies at present and priority on its waiting list is given to children from its own catchment area.  The child does not live in this school's catchment area.  Even if the school had a vacancy, I understand the child's parents have no means of transporting her to school.</P>
      <P>Our Department's school transport scheme provides transport to children attending their nearest suitable special class or special school.  In this case, as I previously stated, transport could be provided to St. Michael's House special school.</P>
      <P>Wherever possible, our Department tries to facilitate children whose parents choose to enrol them in a special school outside the catchment area by allowing them access, on an incidental basis, to special school transport services.  If a place in St. Catherine's had been offered to the child, it would not have been possible to facilitate her with incidental transport as there is no space on the nearest transport service.  I also understand the child's parents could not have brought her to the pick-up point.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Gilmore's concern that the child has been without schooling for some time. This is a serious matter.  However, I assure the Deputy that St. Michael's House special school can offer a suitable educational placement for the child.  A placement is available to the child from September if the parents wish to enrol her and transport will be provided for her.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Gilmore said and thank him for raising this important and sensitive case.  It is very important that the child at this stage of development gets the maximum opportunity to enter a proper educational environment. Perhaps collectively, I, Deputy Gilmore and the Department might be able to persuade the parents that placing the child in the school which has a placement from September would be in her best interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 31 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 31 of 24 March 1998, my Department has developed an outline strategy for the continued development of tourism in the context of EU structural funding, 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that our tourism industry has enjoyed unprecedented growth over the past decade.  We are well on target to exceed the ambitious targets set out under the EU co-funded Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has projected a growth in visitor numbers from a record five million in 1997 to just over seven million in 2003, with foreign earnings projected to grow from £2.1 billion in 1997 to almost £3.7 billion in 2003.  The business and holiday travel sectors are expected to show strongest growth over the next five years.  It is too early, at this stage, to say which market segments will definitively offer the greatest prospects, but my Department is currently engaged in a process of consultations with the State agencies and the tourism industry with the objective of developing a shared vision for the continued development of Irish tourism.</P>
      <P>With regard to the levels of contribution to tourism development from the industry, the Exchequer and the EU form a central part of the discussions.  Also relevant in this context is the question of how we can ensure that businesses which benefit directly from tourism growth, such as retailing, restaurants, licensed vintners, entertainment and so on, will in future make an effective financial contribution to tourism development and promotion.  Our collective aim is to foster a more self sustainable tourism sector that remains environmentally sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> There is a consensus that the key to continued and sustainable tourism growth is partnership between the Government and EU, the tourism State agencies and the industry.  Working through the details of that partnership, with an enhanced role for the industry and other commercial interests benefiting form tourism, is one of the priorities of the current discussions and consultation process.  The discussions will also be informed by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation &mdash; ITIC &mdash;&ldquo;Strategy for Growth beyond 2000&rdquo;, the launch of which I attended on May 25, and Bord Fáilte's &ldquo;Draft Business Plan for Irish Tourism Marketing 1998-2003&rdquo;, which will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>Like most other Government Departments, my Department has commenced the process of negotiation with the Department of Finance with a view to securing the maximum investment in tourism for the years 2000-2006 under the proposed new national development plan for that period.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to underestimate the challenges we face in negotiating a new tourism programme, given competing priorities for support within our economy and the prospect of reduced EU financial support under the next round of Structural Funds.  However, I will make the most persuasive case possible for the continued funding of the tourism industry by the EU.  The industry has proven to be a sound investment over the past decade and it has much to contribute to the European Commission's priorities which include protection of the environment, regional development, encouragement of small and medium sized enterprises, social training, reintegration of the economically marginalised and employment creation.</P>
    <P>The historic advances towards peace on this island also present great opportunities for deepening co-operation in tourism marketing on an all-Ireland basis and I believe this is a development which the European Union will be anxious to support.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the official tourism and travel figures for the first quarter of 1998 which were released by the Central Statistics Office on Thursday, 11 June. These figures show that the number of overseas visitors grew by 11 per cent on the same period in 1997, from 781,000 to 867,000.  While revenue figures are not yet available for the first quarter of 1998, the recent CSO release confirms that foreign earnings from tourism increased by 11 per cent in 1997 to exceed £2.1 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first three months traditionally accounts <Col N="187" /> for 15 per cent of business and this year's double digit growth augurs well for the tourism season as a whole in 1998.  As one of the key objectives of my Department's strategy for tourism development is to improve tourism activity outside the peak period, I am particularly pleased with this level of growth in the off-peak season.</P>
    <P>The official CSO figures are national figures and do not provide details of visitors on a regional basis.  However, figures compiled by Bord Fáilte, based on their survey of overseas travellers and CSO figures, indicate that visitor numbers and revenue increased in all regions in 1997.  However, as I have indicated in the past, the development of tourism in the regions is a day to day matter for each regional tourism authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 36 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.  To that end, the interdepartmental committee on local development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>The pilot project will target four areas: Dublin's north-east inner city; the canal communities of Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House and Dolphin House; Jobstown, Tallaght and Togher, Cork.  The initial stage of the project involves consultation with local communities about the needs of their areas culminating in area reports profiling existing services and resources; identifying the extent of integration between them and devising a framework to enhance co-ordination and integration of efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A steering group comprising representatives from the Departments of Tourism, Sport and <Col N="188" /> Recreation, of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of Environment and Local Government and from Area Development Management Ltd.  &mdash; ADM &mdash; has been established under the auspices of the interdepartmental committee on local development to oversee the project.</P>
    <P>Given ADM's experience in relation to partnerships and its knowledge of local communities, it has been given an important role in the day-to-day management of the project and has now appointed a central co-ordinator to oversee the project's implementation.  Reports will be drawn up on the four areas, in consultation with the local communities.  It is intended that reports will be available in the autumn.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention that a successful model evolved during this project will be extended to other urban areas of major disadvantage. Such an extension will be informed by an objective mapping of deprivation in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I hope that final recommendations will go to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion in the autumn. Action after that date will be determined by the nature of the recommendations and the decisions of the Cabinet committee.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is responsible for housing estate management.  His Department has overseen the publication of the second report of the housing management group, which recommends the adaptation of an inter-agency approach by the local authorities in housing estate management.</P>
    <P>Many large urban local authority estates suffer acute levels of deprivation in terms of educational disadvantage, unemployment, crime and drug misuse.  This report examines how local authorities can take the lead role in ensuring that the co-ordinated plans and programmes of the relevant State bodies address these fundamental problems.  A housing unit was established in March of this year in the Institute of Public Administration &mdash; IPA &mdash; with a specific mandate to examine and implement the proposals made. Any questions on this issue should be addressed to the Minister for Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 25, 27, 52 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Under the national drugs strategy, the Government has allocated £10 million towards the implementation of the action plans prepared by the 13 local drugs task forces, 12 in Dublin and one in north Cork city, to respond to the problem of drug demand in those areas where drug misuse is most prevalent</P>
      <P>Under a separate initiative, the Government has allocated £30 million over the next three years to the young people's facilities and services fund, of which £20 million will be directed at the 13 task force areas to support a variety of capital projects, including sport and recreational facilities, and non-capital projects.  Local development groups consisting of representatives of the local drugs task forces, the vocational education committees and the local authorities, are being set up in the 13 task force areas to prepare integrated plans.  These plans will be submitted, by the end of September, via the local drugs task forces to an assessment committee, chaired by my Department, which will assess the plans and make recommendations in relation to the allocation of funding to the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion and drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An external evaluator has recently been appointed by my Department to carry out an independent evaluation of the Government's drugs initiative which will include an examination of the effectiveness of the structures used and the relationship between them; the effectiveness of the local drugs task forces having regard to their terms of reference, including the process by which they prepared their plans and the extent to which the plans have contributed to the response to the local drugs problem; under the various themes of prevention, education, treatment-rehabilitation <Col N="190" /> and supply, the effectiveness of a number of selected projects being funded and the factors which contributed to the success or failure of these projects; how the drugs initiative dovetails with other initiatives in relation to drug misuse already being undertaken or in the pipeline; and to make recommendations on the basis of their examination.</P>
    <P>The evaluator has also been asked to prepare performance indicators to facilitate the subsequent measurement of outputs from individual projects in task force areas.  The evaluation will be completed by mid September and will inform an overall review of the Government's drugs strategy which I expect will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The sports capital programme <Col N="191" /> provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for assisting the development of sport and recreational facilities in Ireland and comprises the major facilities and the recreational facilities schemes.</P>
      <P>An application for funding under the programme was received from Erin's Isle GAA Club in January 1998.  Following an examination of the some 1,400 applications in hand, including that from Erin's Isle, at 11 February 1998, the closing date for receipt of applications under the existing programme, the full 1998 round of grants under the programme were allocated last April.  Erin's Isle GAA Club was not among the 235 projects approved for grant aid in 1998 and was advised accordingly.  As all available funding under the programme has now been committed, I am not in a position to reconsider the application for funding from the club.</P>
      <P>The sports capital programme is under review. This review will be carried out over the next few months and when it is completed, which I expect to be towards the end of 1998, details of the new schemes will be widely publicised.  It will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new schemes.</P>

      <P>The introduction of a national sports anti-doping programme underlines the Government's commitment to creating a sporting environment that fosters the pursuit of excellence and fulfilment in sport by fair and ethical means, and to ratification of the Council of Europe Anti-Doping Convention 1989, which Ireland signed in 1992.  I am pleased to state that the programme will reflect both the general principles of the anti-doping advisory committee's report and many of its recommendations.  I will be happy to supply the Deputy directly with details of the new programme if he wishes.</P>

      <P>The company, under the chairmanship of Mr. Derek Keogh, plans to steal a march on the rest of the world by starting Ireland's millennium party with St. Patrick's festival in March 1999 and continuing it countrywide, through the year, by enhancing and developing other selected festivals.</P>
      <P>The company has already produced a logo for Ireland's millennium celebrations and this logo will be used widely by the tourism industry, festivals and events around the country and in international marketing campaigns.</P>
      <P>The company also advertised in the national press earlier this year for festival organisers throughout the country to present their ideas for enhancing their own festivals to the company.  At present the company is in the final stages of assessing a number of festival applications for support this year, preparatory to 1999, and this may be in the form of funding, marketing or operational assistance.  An announcement of those festivals selected for support will be made in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The Government considered the Report of Inquiry into Matters relating to Child Sexual Abuse in Swimming last week, and on Wednesday 17 June, 1998, I formally submitted it to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Committee decided at its meeting that evening that the full contents of the report would be annexed to their interim report on the subject of child protection in sport for submission to each House of the Oireachtas.  The Joint Committee state that this will facilitate immediate discussions on implementation of the report's recommendations and enable Members of the <Col N="193" /> House and interested parties to submit their observations to the committee for consideration in the context of their final report.  Observations have been looked for within six weeks.</P>
    <P>I have written to Dr. Breda McLeavey, chairperson of the expert committee which drew up the Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in Ireland in 1996, and asked her to reconvene the committee to review the contents of the code in the light of the Murphy report, which, incidentally, makes no specific recommendation in relation to the code.</P>
    <P>Recommendations relating to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, mandatory reporting and prosecution policy have been referred to the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform respectively for their consideration.</P>
    <P>However, the vast bulk of the recommendations in the report relate to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.  The IASA was given a copy of the report on 17 June and was requested to give it urgent and immediate consideration. The IASA has since provided me with its executive council's initial response.  This response includes the executive council's proposed strategy for the implementation of the report's recommendations. I indicated in a subsequent reply to the association that I shall consider the issue of funding as soon as it has completed its proposed consultations with its wider membership who must be satisfied as to the adequacy of procedures and arrangements in place in their organisation to secure a safe environment for their younger members.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sports Council, in conjunction with the National Coaching and Training Centre, have begun planning a seminar for later this year for the national governing bodies of sport.  The purpose is to ensure the widest dissemination among sports organisations of the inquiry's recommendations, the outcome of the review of the code of ethics, the findings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, and, most of all, to underline once again the importance of ensuring the protection of their younger members.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 105 together .</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment given in its joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, the Government decided in December 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.  The tender procedure is being conducted in line with procedures set out in EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC.</P>
      <P>The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday, 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>Developers were requested to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50-metre swimming pool, capable primarily of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition.  They were also required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the project. The final date for receipt of candidatures was 5 March 1998.</P>
      <P>Invitation to tender documentation, including a comprehensive project brief, issued to nine qualified candidates on 26 March, inviting them to prepare full tender submissions for the project. The Department has advised candidates that further work needs to be done on the draft contract-legal agreement for the project before it can be issued and the Department expects to issue the outstanding documentation shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Work on the pool can only commence when a successful tenderer has been identified and matters such as planning permission are in place.  It is anticipated that the construction phase of the <Col N="196" /> project will be 15 months from the date of any agreement, although a longer period will be considered in the light of submitted proposals.</P>

      <P>CERT is the State tourism training agency and includes in its range of activities, training for the unemployed for positions in the tourism sector.  Since 1994, a total of 4,500 unemployed persons have been trained and CERT plan to train a further 2,900 by the end of 1999, bringing the total to 7,400 over the entire period of the Operational Programme for Tourism (1994-1999).</P>
      <P>Training for the unemployed is delivered on a sub-regional basis in three permanent centres and up to five temporary centres each year.  Placement rates from these programmes are consistently high at a national average of 85 per cent, with some centres achieving up to 98 per cent placement rate on completion of each programme.</P>
      <P>In order to attract unemployed people into the industry, CERT works with local area based partnerships to promote tourism training and to assist in recruiting unemployed persons for CERT training programmes.</P>
      <P>The CERT National Recruitment Committee which is representative of industry bodies and CERT, meets regularly to assist in the development of local promotional initiatives to attract new recruits to the industry.  Industry bodies now recognise and are responding to the competitive recruitment environment in which they find themselves.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will note, strenuous efforts are being made to attract and encourage unemployed people into the tourism sector.  The industry is buoyant at this time and opportunities continue to exist so I would urge the unemployed to look closely now at the sector in terms of worthwhile and productive employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply to his previous Dáil questions on 13 May 1998, safety at sports grounds is the responsibility, in the first instance, of those who organise events and those who own or administer the grounds or venues in which sports fixtures are held.</P>

      <Col N="198" /> The voluntary Code of Practice for Safety at Sports Grounds, published by the Department of Education in 1996, was prepared by a working party, chaired by a senior local authority official, which also included a senior garda, a chief fire officer, a local authority building surveyor and a local authority senior structural engineer.  It is primarily for the guidance of organisers and ground administrators and has been widely distributed to sports organisations, the Garda, health boards, local authorities, event promoters etc.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, the gardaí and health boards, of course, play a central and ongoing role, in assisting ground management to meet their responsibilities and may, in certain circumstances, have to insist on specific measures being taken in order to achieve reasonable standards of safety.</P>

However as overall responsibility for the project rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, the Deputy will appreciate that any issues in relation to the proposed development are a matter for her.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to this House in the past and most recently in December 1997, there is already in place an extensive system of registration and listing in accordance with standards set by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>One of Bord Fáilte's functions is the registration of certain types of tourist accommodation such as hotels, guesthouses, holiday cottages, holiday apartments and holiday hostels.  Arising from the implementation of the recommendations of the review of Bord Fáilte carried out by consultants Arthur D. Little Limited in 1994, the inspection activities associated with these functions were contracted to a third party, Tourism Quality Services Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, Bord Fáilte's system of approval for listing accommodation in the bed and breakfast sector was also out-sourced to industry associations formally recognised by Bord Fáilte, <Col N="199" /> as self-regulatory bodies, on the basis that they apply Bord Fáilte agreed standards.</P>
    <P>The issue of licensing all tourist accommodation has been examined by successive administrations over the years and they have all come to the same conclusion that any compulsory system in order to be effective would require endless administration and policing, particularly as many operators only operate for short periods of the year.  All providers of accommodation for tourists are obliged, whether approved or unapproved, to comply with official requirements in areas such as taxation, planning, fire and safety and hygiene. Earlier this year, I wrote to my ministerial colleagues with responsibility in these areas asking them to ensure that there are no advantages for unapproved operators in the application of the law.</P>
    <P>I believe that the best solution is to encourage unapproved operators to become approved and to this end both Bord Fáilte and the recognised approving bodies will continue to encourage all operators to seek approved status.  They will explain to them not only what is involved in terms of procedure, but also the benefits to be gained from being part of the approved sector, including access to official marketing through Bord Fáilte and the tourist office network, and access to the tax breaks or other subsidised finance schemes which are available.</P>

      <P>My colleague the Minister for Finance raised this matter at the ECOFIN meeting on 19 May.  While he did not manage to convince all of his ECOFIN colleagues or the EU Commission to change from their long-standing opposition to carrying out a study of the effects of ending intra-Community duty free sales from 30 June 1999, he did manage to get support from a considerable number of member states.  These included France and Germany, for the first time at ECOF1N, and this was a very welcome development.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work to advance the cause of the Irish duty free industry by seeking to influence ECOFIN and the Commission and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will now consider the best approach to follow in the light of the outturn of the last ECOFIN discussion on the subject.</P>

      <P>The Minster for Public Enterprise has overall responsibility for air transport policy, including the development of more competitive, regular and good access links to our main markets with particular emphasis on exploiting opportunities for expanding access to the regions generally.</P>
      <P>The big expansion in access to Ireland in recent years has provided great opportunities for the regions with an increasing number of European tour operators undertaking direct charter services into airports outside Dublin, including Cork, Kerry, Shannon and Knock.  Last week, I attended the inauguration of a new schedule service by Continental Airlines from Dublin and Shannon to New York/Newark.  This new service will serve the growing demand for transatlantic air travel and I very much welcome another major US carrier choosing Ireland as an important European destination.</P>
      <P>My Department also keeps in regular contact with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which has overall responsibility for ferries. The access sea links between Ireland and Britain have improved substantially with the introduction of a new generation of superferries by Irish Ferries and Stena, resulting in much improved capacity and comfort and shorter crossing times.  This opens up the prospect of a range of new business, in particular, in the short-break and off-season markets.</P>
      <P>The latest available statistics on total tourism revenue show that all regions are enjoying tourism spending far in excess of the levels achieved in the past.  The 1997 figures show tourism revenue in every region of the country has grown faster than the International or European averages over the period 1989 to 1996.</P>
      <P>As a result of last year's Supplementary Estimate, Bord Fáilte has available an extra £5 million to enable it to increase and intensify its level of promotional and marketing activity for the coming tourist season, with the particular objective of securing a broader regional distribution of tourism revenue.  In response, the board has devised a multi-layered approach which consists of enhancing existing programmes, introducing new regional initiatives and exploiting opportunities which are coming on stream.  The board's intention is to have a strong regional emphasis in the activities proposed and to maximise the return by integrating activity at local, regional and national levels.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 102 together.</P>
      <P>One of the commitments in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium is to recognise the value of sport and leisure to the physical and mental health of each individual, especially in the role they can play in fostering a sense of community identity in even the most disadvantaged areas.  Accordingly one of the goals I have set for my Department is to encourage increased participation in sport and recreation, particularly in disadvantaged communities.</P>
      <P>A number of measures are under way in my Department aimed at achieving this goal.  The Sports Council is being established on a statutory basis.  It will have amongst its functions the promotion of sport, and the development of strategies to increase participation in recreational sport and the co-ordination of their implementation through the relevant bodies involved in this area.  The various elements of a recreational policy are also being considered including, the role of other Departments, State agencies and bodies involved in the promotion and development of recreation, and the piloting of sport and recreational initiatives in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Grant assistance of a capital and non-capital nature is currently available for the promotion and development of sport and recreation, to a range of groups in the community, from governing bodies to individual clubs and groups.</P>
      <P>Some 235 individual projects, spread throughout the country and covering both sport and recreational facilities, were approved for grants totalling almost £5 million in this year's round of allocations under the Sports Capital Programme. The programme has outstanding grant commitments of over £19 million.  A sum of £9 million is provided in this year's Estimates to meet anticipated claims in respect of grant approved projects due for completion in the current year.  The Sports Capital Programme is now being reviewed and I expect to advertise revised schemes before year end when applications will be invited in respect of the 1999 round of allocations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1996, Telecom Éireann has operated a <Col N="205" /> PIN code system for access to premium rate sex lines.  This is a subscriber system which requires those who wish to use the services to register with Telecom Éireann and access to sex line numbers is possible only with the use of a PIN number.</P>
    <P>I understand that these controls have not, however, prevented sex line services which are provided from abroad from being accessed from this country.

      <P>Ear defenders lost, damaged or misplaced are replaced after each kit inspection.  It should also be noted that ear defenders are inspected during training for range practices while undergoing tests on elementary training and that no personnel are permitted on firing ranges without appropriate protection.</P>

      <Quest>the position regarding tax relief at Sligo Airport Enterprise Park; if the tax relief can be availed of by the developer provided the building is occupied by a qualifying project before 31 December 1999; his views on the extreme difficulty in getting private sector investment or achieving the successful development of the park which involves considerable commitment on the part of the airport company; if it is necessary to await receiving designation before construction work can commence; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15342/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 340 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, makes provision for the designation by order of areas immediately adjacent to seven regional airports as enterprise areas.  The airports in question are Cork, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Knock, Sligo and Waterford.  The designation order may be made by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Public Enterprise and following receipt of a proposal from or on behalf of a qualifying company intending to carry on qualifying trading operations immediately adjacent to a regional airport.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that in May 1997, in the context of State Aids, the Competition Directorate of the EU Commission sought detailed information on the new tax reliefs for regional airports and new enterprise areas provided in the Finance Act, 1997.  This was on foot of an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> publicising the new schemes.  The Commission then initiated a full investigation into the enterprise areas, including those six enterprise areas developed under the 1994 Finance Act.  Last December, the Commission decided to approve the tax reliefs for existing and some new enterprise areas in the context of State Aids but the decision did not cover the regional airports enterprise areas scheme.  EU officials have since informed my Department that the rates relief and double rent relief will not be approved by the Commission whenever a submission is made to them seeking EU approval for tax designation at any of the regional airport enterprise areas.  However, it is understood there is no objection to the provision of capital allowances.  Therefore, when projects for the airports enterprise areas are approved by the Irish authorities and areas are then designated, they will be submitted to the EU Commission for approval in respect of the capital allowances.</P>
      <P>The approval of qualifying companies to operate in a regional airport enterprise area is through a certification process involving, <i>inter alia</i>, Forfás and the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance.  The tax reliefs comprise of capital allowances of up to 100 per cent. on expenditure incurred on the construction or refurbishment of premises used by qualifying companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a project for an airport enterprise area has been approved and the area designated, the qualifying period for the relief is specified in the <Col N="210" /> designating order to be made by the Minister for Finance.  This is the period during which capital expenditure incurred on premises is eligible for tax relief.  Under the legislation, the commencement date specified in the order shall not commence before 1 August 1994 or end after 31 December 1999.  The tax relief is not available until after the area has been designated.  Designation is subject to EU approval.  If work commences on a project before designation, the expenditure incurred in the period before the commencement date specified in the order will not now qualify for the airport enterprise areas tax relief.</P>
    <P>With regard to private sector investment and to achieving the successful development of the Sligo Airport Enterprise Park, this is an area where it is hoped the airport enterprise area scheme will have a positive effect.  However, the constraints imposed by meeting our EU Treaty obligations in the context of State aids make it imperative that developers and airport authorities work together to find suitable projects, which will meet the requirements of the EU Commission rules.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, gives powers to the health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes.  The Act also introduced a new system of nursing home subventions so that dependent people most in need of nursing care would have access to such care.  The scheme is intended to assist persons in meeting the cost of nursing home care but it is not intended to meet the full costs involved.  The legislation respects in full the private or voluntary ownership of homes and makes no provision for State involvement in the <Col N="212" /> level of fees charged or the amount of accommodation provided by this sector.</P>
    <P>Additional funding was made available by my Department in late 1997 to facilitate health boards in the implementation of Nursing Homes legislation, including the Nursing Homes (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996. These regulations allow boards, inter alia, to pay an enhanced subvention in certain circumstances. The question of increasing the level of subvention will be considered in the light of the availability of resources and other priorities in respect of the development of services for older people.</P>
    <P>A new capital programme for services for older people is close to completion and will be announced shortly.  The programme will involve a significant increase in the level of resources previously made available.  This investment will accelerate the provision of additional health board extended care facilities, rehabilitation, convalescent, respite-intermittent care and day care facilities for older people throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I met the Friends of Mallow General Hospital last December and emphasised my commitment to ensuring that the hospital would continue to contribute effectively to the delivery of acute hospital services in the Southern Health Board area.  Following that meeting officials of my Department visited the hospital on my instructions and had discussions with the medical and nursing staff at the hospital and with Southern Health Board management.  In asking my officials to visit the hospital, I emphasised the need to focus on the capacity of the hospital to deal with the prevailing level of activity.  The Southern Health Board has been asked to put forward proposals in this regard and I understand that these are currently being developed, following discussions between the staff of the hospital and Southern Health Board management.</P>

    <P>Proposals received from the health boards for expenditure of the capital funding are currently being considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the additional funding made available by this Government &mdash; £10 million in 1997 and £8.4 million in 1998 &mdash; for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities represents a major step towards meeting the recommendations contained in the report, <i>Towards an Independent Future</i> of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities.</P>
    <P>A fundamental recommendation in the review group report is the establishment of a database on the health service needs of persons with physical and sensory disabilities.  This task is crucial to identifying priorities for the development of services for people with such disabilities over the coming years.  A joint database pilot project in three health boards has been completed and I will be setting up a database development committee shortly. <Col N="214" /></P>

      <P>Article 38 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, empowers road authorities to prohibit the parking of large vehicles in specified areas, following an approach applied to selective parking restrictions and prohibitions generally.  The article provides that where a no parking sign, accompanied by an information plate containing the symbol of a large vehicle and indicating a specified unladen <Col N="215" /> weight, is in place, a vehicle which exceeds that unladen weight can not be parked; this prohibition continues until a traffic sign is encountered indicating that the prohibition has ended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland has endorsed the pan-European biological and landscape diversity strategy (PEBLDS) and is one of the states participating in the pan-European ecological network.  Ireland also provides an alternate representative to the executive bureau of PEBLDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in the Sofia Declaration of October 1995 European Ministers for the Environment agreed to establish the pan-European ecological network within ten years in the context of action theme I of the PEBLDS. Implementation of the network will build upon a range of existing European initiatives, including the NATURA 2000 network being established under the terms of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives.  Ireland has transposed the directives into national law.  The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, lays obligations <Col N="218" /> on certain Ministers, local authorities and other bodies in regard to the protection of European sites of ecological importance such as special areas of conservation (SACs) and special protection areas (SPAs).  The main part of Ireland's SAC network has, since March 1997, been publicly advertised for designation and has been legally protected from that date.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that PEBLDS is the pan-European response to support the implementation of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which Ireland ratified in 1996. Among the aims of that convention are the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and a key means of achieving these is through the development of biodiversity plans by the parties to the convention.  A national biodiversity plan is currently being prepared by my Department which will address the areas relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As I was anxious to have the widest possible participation in the development of the biodiversity plan, I arranged for a public consultation process last year by announcing that such a plan was being prepared and seeking written submissions from interested bodies and individuals.  Approximately 50 submissions were received and these are being taken into consideration in the context of the drafting of the national biodiversity plan.</P>
    <P>The plan will review the state of biological diversity in Ireland and outline the measures which are currently in place for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in Ireland.  However, the main focus of the plan will be on setting out strategies and actions to be undertaken for the conservation and sustainable use of such biological diversity in the future.  The plan will examine biodiversity at ecosystem, species and the genetic level and it will cover all ecosystems, terrestrial, freshwater and marine and all taxonomic groups.  The plan will pay special attention to the need for the integration of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into all relevant sectors and will consider the main sectors which impact on biodiversity, including agriculture, forestry and the marine.</P>
    <P>In addition, an interdepartmental steering group on biodiversity has also been established, the primary function of which is to secure the involvement of the main Departments who are responsible for biodiversity, to provide for a point of direct contact between them, and to co-ordinate the response to and implementation of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have the national biodiversity plan published before the end of the year and I am confident that it will represent a significant step in the process of Irelands implementation of its commitments in regard to biodiversity, not only under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity but also in regard to the PEBLDS.</P>
    <P>I am very aware of the all-island dimension that <Col N="219" /> exists in regard to biodiversity issues and have already agreed in principle to participate in a meeting with my Northern counterpart, Lord Dubs, regarding these matters.  There has been some preliminary discussion at official level and I hope that the finalisation of arrangements in relation to a meeting at ministerial level can take place in the near future.</P>

      <P>In 1997, 5.1 million overseas visitors came to Ireland, an increase of 9 per cent on 1996.  Foreign exchange earnings from tourism increased by more than 11 per cent to exceed £2.1 billion.  This year is likely to see a continuation of the strong growth achieved last year in the British <Col N="221" /> and North American markets, with modest growth expected from mainland Europe.  Bord Fáilte has forecast overall growth of 8 per cent in visitor numbers and 9 per cent in total foreign revenue in 1998 which will be spread throughout all the regions.</P>
      <P>As to the subject of where tourists are likely to visit in Ireland, that, of course, is ultimately a matter of consumer preference and choice, but the Deputy can be assured that Bord Fáilte's new package of regional measures will seek the most balanced distribution possible.</P>
      <P>The board has devised a multi-layered approach which consists of enhancing existing programmes, introducing new regional initiatives and exploiting opportunities which are coming onstream.  The board's intention is to have a strong regional emphasis in the activities proposed and to maximise the return by integrating activity at local, regional and national levels.</P>

      <P>My Department, in collaboration with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, has recently recruited 15 psychologists to work in the primary sector.  Even after this increase in staffing, there remain a number of areas, including County Waterford, where it has not yet been possible for my Department to provide a psychological service for primary schools.</P>
      <P>The 15 psychologists were appointed on merit after an open competition, during which all qualified candidates were interviewed.  On this occasion, however, none of the successful candidates was available to work in the Waterford area.</P>
      <P>However, it is the Government's intention to provide a national educational psychological service which will be available to all schools in the country, both primary and post-primary.  A planning group which includes representatives of all the partners in education has been set up with the task of preparing detailed recommendations for the Government on the development of this service.</P>
      <P>The planning group will make recommendations as to the developments which will be necessary to identify, prioritise and to meet the needs for psychological intervention in all schools.  Its work is now well advanced and it is expected that it will report to me in the very near future.</P>

      <P>The question of granting exemption to schools from the requirement to purchase television licences is, in fact, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation, there is no distinction made between television sets used as monitors for videos and those used to receive television programmes.  Any provision to exempt schools from the requirement to purchase television licences would require a change in legislation.</P>
      <P>The cost of purchasing a television licence is part of the normal running costs of schools which are covered under the scheme of capitation grants.  Schools which are in designated areas of disadvantage have the cost of their television licences refunded to them by my Department.</P>

      <P>In the case of my Department, all software required to meet business needs is purchased centrally by the IT unit in accordance with Government and EU procurement regulations and is fully licensed.  In addition, security procedures are in place to ensure that unauthorised or unlicensed software is not installed on my Department's IT networks.</P>
      <P>All agencies under the auspices of my Department are bound by Government and EU procurement regulations when using State funds to purchase computer software.  The responsibility for ensuring that unlicensed software is not used rests with each individual agency.  With regard to primary and second-level schools, the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, which I established recently, has invited all school principals to regional meetings to discuss expenditure of grant aid received under the &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo; programme.  The NCTE is drawing the attention of attendees at these meetings to the need to ensure that only licensed software is used in schools.</P>

While my Department would wish to do all that it can to help students who have to cope with adversity in their lives, there is also the need to apply uniform and objective criteria to the marking of students work.</P>
