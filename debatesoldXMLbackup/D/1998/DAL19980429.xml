      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 3, International War Crimes Tribunals Bill, 1997 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and No. 20, Employment Equality Bill, 1997 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that Private Members' Business shall be No. 31, National Sports Council of Ireland Bill, 1998 &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed), and the proceedings on the Second Stage thereof shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, as a matter of urgency, what steps the Government is taking to ensure that Friday does not become a free day for criminals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <P>We had a discussion on this matter yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that we make laws in this House but we rely on the Garda Síochána to enforce them?  If the gardaí are not available to do their work on Friday, our law making is futile.  I again ask the Taoiseach what steps the Government intends to take to ensure Friday is not a free day for criminals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost one hour was devoted to this matter yesterday afternoon.  We cannot have a repeat of it.  The matter the Deputy is raising is a repeat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the place to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an evolving situation. Yesterday the Minister said he hoped to meet the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána.  I presume he has at last met him in the past 24 hours and that, presumably, he will provide us with the answer to my question: what does the Government <Col N="422" /> intend to do to ensure that Friday does not become a free day for criminals?  This is a matter of supreme importance as far as law making and law enforcement is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy resumes his seat I will see if the Taoiseach wishes to make a brief comment but we will not have a full-scale debate on the matter.  I will call Deputy Quinn on the same matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any legislative proposals to deal with the emergency security situation that will arise on Friday and if those proposals will be brought before this House today or tomorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputies Bruton and Quinn, emergency legislation will not be brought forward.  This is an evolving situation. The Government will do everything it can to ensure that operational difficulties do not arise on Friday.  I remain hopeful that there will not be any difficulties on Friday and that the responsible members of the Garda will not engage in action that I do not believe is justified.  In terms of Deputy Bruton's direct question, a meeting will take place shortly after the Order of Business between the Minister, his senior officials and the Commissioner to ensure operational matters are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being held because we pushed the Minister yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a further discussion on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a real threat to people's lives on Friday if proper Garda protection is not provided.  We might as well not have drink driving or speeding laws if there are no gardaí on the streets to enforce them.  We do not want a free day for drunken driving&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have statements. If the Deputy has a brief question I will hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree this is a threat to the very institutions of the State?  In that same context, will he ask his Ministers to show respect for the institutions of the State?  In particular, will he ask the Minister who referred to officials of the Department of Finance as misers and troglodytes to keep quiet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious matter.  I do not believe that the way for the gardaí to pursue a normal industrial relations matter is to engage in what will allegedly happen on Friday.  I hope the meaningful negotiations that have gone on for several weeks, with a justifiable and fair offer of 7 per cent on the table and other matters remaining to be discussed, will continue and that those who negotiate for the gardaí, through bodies I <Col N="423" /> have long respected, will continue those negotiations and not talk about figures of 39 per cent which will not be conceded this Friday, next Friday or any other Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to intervene in what are clearly difficult negotiations of an industrial relations nature between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Finance and the Garda Síochána, but I draw the Taoiseach's attention to a situation that would have arisen in the context of the provision of health services where, notwithstanding any dispute between health care workers and the Department of Health, provisions would have been made for emergency care by the health workers in hospitals.  What the public wants to know, and will need to know after the meeting today with the Commissioner, is what provision for minimum security care will be put in place on Friday if the &ldquo;get sick&rdquo; campaign achieves the momentum its organisers hope to achieve.  The Opposition and the public are entitled to know the provision there will be for security cover if gardaí do not report for work.  The Taoiseach has an obligation, arising from the meeting with the Commissioner, to inform the public of that cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach replies, will he make a commitment that after the meeting a full and comprehensive statement will be made? In view of the unedifying experience yesterday of the Minister refusing to give basic information in this House and speaking at length, could the Taoiseach make it clear that a full and comprehensive statement will be made following this meeting to allay fears in the community and pinpoint exactly what provision is to be made to protect the public good?  Will he intervene in an appropriate way to ensure that negotiations start again because at the moment there is, in effect, a vacuum?  No matter how much the Taoiseach hopes things will be put right before Friday, it is quite clear it will require extraordinary action on his part to ensure that this matter is put back in some kind of negotiating mode before there is chaos on Friday and many people not only alarmed but damaged by the failure of the Government to deal with what we all recognise is a difficult and pressing issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Meetings have taken place over a number of days.  We had several meetings last week to discuss operational matters if these events take place.  I continue to hope they will not, that they will not be successful to the extent hoped by the people who want to disrupt because that is the wrong way to deal with these issues. Operational matters are being worked through by the commissioner.  They are matters for him and for the Minister for Justice in co-operation with him.  Whatever statements have to be made will be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are also matters for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As to intervening in an appropriate way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there cannot be meaningful discussions when the Government offer is at a high level in terms of the PCW.  We are dealing with a 16 months old programme, a programme the Garda had signed off but, because of the circumstances of the signing off, were allowed to come back in.  They are demanding 39 per cent. A mechanism under Mr. Brennan as chairman was put in place from which, unfortunately, the Garda walked away.  They should go back to it as that is the way to have meaningful discussions. The Government is offering 7 per cent and the Garda are demanding 39 per cent.  All the Garda bodies know that there are figures that cannot be breached because of agreements made right across the board.  That needs to be understood. Nothing will move the Government from that position, and the Garda must understand that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This coming weekend the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will be engaged in very important and fundamental negotiations and discussions in Brussels.  I wish him and the Minister for Finance every success on that historic weekend.  Is it the intention of the Government to provide time next week at the earliest possible opportunity for a report on the outcome of the Brussels Summit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as is normal in connection with a European Council meeting I would like to report to the House.  Perhaps the best way of doing that would be to have a joint report, when I will report on the European Council and the Minister for Finance will report on ECOFIN.  We will make arrangements for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the broadcasting Bill to be introduced by the Minister cater for the findings in the recent Coughlan case?  Will extra resources be given to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, which is seriously understaffed and under-resourced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation is being brought forward.  I do not know whether the legislation takes account of that case, but I am sure it would have to take such account.</P>

      <P>In the debate on the Democratic Left Bill on amnesty for refugees, the Minister for Justice indicated that he would bring legislation forward urgently to criminalise trafficking in refugees and immigrants to this State.  I note from the list of legislation circulated that it is not listed in the legislation for the current session. It is at No. 61 in the general list.  When does <Col N="425" /> the Taoiseach expect that legislation to be brought before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are working on the immigrant trafficking Bill which will make trafficking in immigrants illegal.  I do not have a date, but I will ask the Department to forward the date to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow up on that, in the course of the debate the Minister indicated that he regarded it as urgent, and clearly it is.  I expect some effort to bring it forward before the summer recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that the Department of Justice has more legislation than any other Department.  It brought forward a number of Bills ahead of schedule in the last session.  The Minister is anxious to bring this Bill forward, but it has to be ready.  As soon as I have a date I will inform the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged initially to ask about the Wildlife Bill.  I also want to ask about two minor Bills which we were assured <Col N="426" /> were short tasks.  The first is the Gaeltacht Housing (Amendment) Bill which was to put right changes in housing in relation to the Gaeltacht since 1989.  The Department has been operating <i>ultra vires</i> in some respects since 1989.  That legislation has been promised.  Will it be introduced before the announcement of further grants, which appears to be indicated in the judgment?  What is the position on the legislation that might be needed for striking down the Blasket Islands legislation?  We were told in the House that the Minister was considering the judgment and that there might be replacement legislation or an appeal of the judgment.  Has the Government made up its mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Attorney General. On the Gaeltacht Housing (Amendment) Bill, this is to give legislative effect to changes made in the housing grants administered by the Department under the Housing Acts of 1929 and 1979. The drafting of the heads has commenced in the Department and it expects their submission to Government during the summer of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill sets out the rights of persons with disabilities together with a means of redress if those rights are denied.  I do not have a date for its publication but I will ask the Department to give one.  To the best of my knowledge, some of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities were implemented and then there were legal difficulties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to implement United Nations resolutions establishing war crimes tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The function of the tribunals is to put on trial and punish as appropriate, persons who are guilty of war crimes in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  I am sure Deputies will welcome this legislation. We have all been appalled by the reports we have had of the atrocities committed in these territories. The depth and scale of the savagery visited on innocent men, women and children which these reports revealed almost passes human comprehension <Col N="428" /> and cried out for vigorous action by the international community.  The Government fully supports the efforts to bring to justice those guilty of war crimes and the purpose of this Bill is to equip the appropriate authorities here with the legal means to arrest, detain and surrender persons found in the State who are wanted by the tribunals.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the UN Security Council became alarmed at continuing reports of violations of international humanitarian law in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  A commission of experts, established to investigate the reports, concluded that grave breaches and other violations of international humanitarian law had been committed, including mass killings, ethnic cleansing, torture, rape, pillage and arbitrary arrests.  The Security Council decided that the situation constituted a threat to international peace and security and expressed its determination to put an end to such crimes and to take effective measures to bring to justice those responsible for them.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was established by Security Council resolutions for the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes against humanity committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991.  The tribunal sits in the Hague, has two trial chambers, one appeal chamber and 11 judges elected by the General Assembly of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the tribunal under these resolutions entails for all member states of the United Nations a binding obligation to comply with the resolutions and to take whatever action is required to give effect to that obligation.  This obligation is further specified in Article 29 of the Statute of the Tribunal, contained in the Third Schedule to the Bill, which provides that all states shall co-operate with the tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of persons accused of crimes within its jurisdiction and comply without undue delay with any request for assistance issued by it, including the surrender of the accused at its request.  There is a similar obligation imposed by Article 28 of the Statute of the Rwanda Tribunal.</P>
    <P>So far, of the 74 persons who have been indicted by the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, 26 are in custody.  I understand that two have been convicted of serious crimes and are serving prison sentences, eight persons are currently on trial and pre-trial proceedings are continuing in relation to the remaining 16.  The tribunal used 200 witnesses in 1997 and expects to use 340 in 1998 and operates a witness protection and relocation programme.</P>
    <P>The expenses of the tribunal are borne by the UN which levies contributions from member states.  Ireland's assessed contribution this year is expected to be something over $100,000.  In addition, Ireland has made a contribution of $120,000 to a voluntary fund to which states may contribute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established under a resolution of the Security Council in 1994 for the purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for acts of genocide or other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of Rwanda and Rwandan citizens responsible for such violations committed in the territory of neighbouring states between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994.  The seat of the tribunal is in Arusha, Tanzania, where it conducts trials and holds suspects.  Like the tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, it has two trial chambers and an appeals chamber and is exploring the establishment of a third trial chamber to expedite hearings. Both tribunals share the same prosecutor. The statutes and rules of procedure of the tribunals are similar.  They are both subsidiary organs of the Security Council but are not subject to its authority or control in the performance of their judicial functions and they are independent of any state or group of states.</P>
    <P>The investigations of the Rwandan tribunal have focused mainly on 400 identified suspects and are being conducted both inside and outside Rwanda, notably in other African countries, Europe and America, where the principal planners of the genocide are thought to be located.  So far, of the 35 persons who have been indicted by the Rwandan tribunal, I understand that 23 are in custody in Arusha and the others are in custody elsewhere, including one detained in the United States.  Four trials as well as other preliminary case hearings are under way and two of the trials are at an advanced stage.  A tribunal victims' and witnesses' protection unit has operated since November 1996.  Some 109 witnesses were used by the tribunal in 1997 and something like 330 are expected to be used in 1998.  There was some dissatisfaction last year with the working of this tribunal, but steps taken by the UN, including the appointment of a new registrar and a new deputy prosecutor, have helped to restore confidence. Sadly, genocidal violence has not ceased yet in Rwanda.  Ireland's assessed contribution to the cost of the Rwanda tribunal for this year is expected to be in the region of $107,000.  It is interesting to note that these tribunals are the first international fora established to try war crimes in the 50 years since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials at the end of the Second World War.</P>
    <P>While the Bill deals specifically with the two tribunals I mentioned, section 37 contains provisions to enable regulations to be made to apply the provisions of the Bill to any other war crimes tribunal or court that may be established by the United Nations in the future.  The crimes over which the tribunals have jurisdiction are all serious crimes against humanity and are listed in articles 2 to 5 of the statute of the former Yugoslavia tribunal, set out in the Third Schedule to the Bill, and in articles 2 to 4 of the statute of the Rwanda tribunal, set out in the Fourth Schedule. Throughout the Bill these crimes are referred to <Col N="430" /> as international tribunal crimes.  Section 4 provides that none of these crimes can be regarded as a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence.  Most, if not all, these offences could not be regarded as political offences under our general extradition law.  The penalties the tribunals may impose are limited to imprisonment and orders for the return to their rightful owners of any property and proceeds acquired by criminal conduct.  Capital punishment is not an option.</P>
    <P>The persons whose surrender may be sought under the Bill are persons who have been accused or convicted of international tribunal crimes and in respect of whom a warrant of arrest has been issued by the relevant tribunal.  The purpose of surrender will be either to have the person brought before the tribunal for trial or brought to a place where he or she is to undergo imprisonment under a sentence imposed by the tribunal. That place may be in any one of the countries which have indicated to the Security Council of the United Nations their willingness to accept and imprison persons sentenced by the tribunals.</P>
    <P>The arrangements the Bill proposes to put in place for the surrender of war criminals or alleged war criminals found in the State are modelled on and similar to the arrangements for the extradition of persons under our general extradition law and contain similar safeguards for constitutional rights.  There are, however, some differences. The arrangements in the Bill are limited to international tribunal crimes.  While applications for extradition are made to the District Court, it was considered, given the novel nature and scope of the tribunals, that applications for surrender under the Bill should go to the High Court.  The Bill provides for the arrest and detention &mdash; for a maximum of 18 days &mdash; of suspects, which is not a feature of general extradition law.  While a suspect may be detained, the Bill does not permit surrender until an arrest warrant, showing that the person is wanted for trial, has been received from the tribunal.  There are a number of provisions in the Bill to ensure that applications by the tribunals for surrender are accorded priority and precedence over other matters.  This reflects articles in the statutes of the tribunals and marks the seriousness which States attach to the pursuit and punishment of persons who commit the heinous crimes with which we are concerned.</P>
    <P>A request by an international tribunal for the surrender of a person will, under section 5, be made to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The person must have been accused or convicted by the tribunal of an international tribunal crime and there must be in existence a warrant of arrest for the purpose of bringing him or her before the tribunal or to a place where he or she is to undergo imprisonment under a sentence imposed by the tribunal.  The request will be in writing with an accurate description of the person wanted and information helping to establish his or her identity.  It will include a statement of each international tribunal crime with which he or she is charged, specifying the date and place <Col N="431" /> of commission of each crime, the legal description of the crime and the provision of the tribunal's statute which applies.  It will also be accompanied by the original or certified copy of the warrant of arrest issued by the tribunal with an indication of the purpose of the arrest.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is satisfied the request complies with the requirements of section 5, if necessary by seeking further information from the tribunal, the Minister will certify under section 8 that a request for the surrender of the person has been made by the tribunal.  When that certificate is produced to the High Court, the court is required by section 9 to issue a warrant for the arrest of the person, unless of course the person is already under arrest under the provisions dealing with provisional arrest.</P>
    <P>As in our extradition law, provisions are included for the provisional arrest, on grounds of urgency, of persons wanted by an international tribunal &mdash; these are chiefly sections 10, 11 and 13.  An international tribunal may make a request for the provisional arrest of a person who has been accused by the tribunal of having committed an international tribunal crime, who has been convicted by it of such a crime or who is suspected by it of having committed such a crime. The request will be in writing and, besides containing information necessary to identify the person, will also contain a statement of the international tribunal crimes in question specifying time and place of commission of each crime.</P>
    <P>Provisional arrest warrants may be issued by the High Court on the sworn information of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector that an international tribunal has made a request for the person's provisional arrest on grounds of urgency and that the person is accused of having committed an international tribunal crime, has been convicted by the tribunal of such a crime or is suspected by the tribunal of having committed such a crime.  The inspector will also indicate that the purpose of the arrest is to detain the person pending receipt by the Minister from the tribunal of a warrant of arrest issued by the tribunal in respect of the person.</P>
    <P>If it subsequently appears to the Minister that a warrant for arrest will not be received from the tribunal in respect of the person named in the provisional arrest warrant or that proceedings will not be commenced against the person by the tribunal, the Minister may cancel the provisional arrest warrant and, if the warrant has been executed, direct that the person be released.  If the tribunal's warrant of arrest and other necessary information is not received in time to enable the Minister's certificate, that a request for surrender has been made, to be produced to the High Court within 18 days after the date of the provisional arrest, the person arrested will be released.</P>
    <P>When, after receipt of a request for provisional arrest on the ground of urgency, the Minister subsequently receives from the tribunal the original <Col N="432" /> or certified copy of a warrant of arrest indicating that the person has been accused or convicted by that tribunal of an international tribunal crime and the purpose of the arrest, with other information required in connection with requests for surrender, the matter will be treated as a request for the surrender of the person and the procedures relating to such requests will then apply.</P>
    <P>When the High Court is satisfied the person has been accused or convicted of an international tribunal crime, that a request for the surrender of the person has been duly made and that a warrant which complies with the requirements of section 5 has been produced, the court will, under section 14, commit the person to prison to await the order of the Minister for his or her surrender. Before committing the person, the court will inform him or her that he or she will not be surrendered except with his or her consent before 15 days have elapsed and inform him or her of the provisions of Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution relating to making a complaint to the High Court that a person is unlawfully detained.</P>
    <P>A person committed to await surrender may be released as a result of a successful application under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution, an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court, if the surrender and conveyance out of the State of the person is unduly delayed, as indicated in section 21 &mdash; this is usual in extradition law &mdash; or if subsequent information satisfies the Minister that the person's surrender is prohibited by the Act.  If the person is not released he or she will, under section 14, be surrendered to a person authorised to receive him or her by the international tribunal that requested his or her surrender or by the State in which the person is to undergo imprisonment for an international tribunal crime.  There are a number of provisions to accord precedence for requests from an international tribunal.  A request from an international tribunal for the surrender of a person will have primacy over requests for the extradition or arrest and delivery of the person under the 1965 Extradition Act whether or not the offence in question in the extradition request constitutes an international tribunal crime.  Section 7 of the Bill so provides.  Section 4 provides that an application for asylum in the State by a person being sought by a tribunal will not prevent or postpone the surrender of the person under the Bill.</P>
    <P>If a request is received for the surrender of a person who is serving a sentence imposed by a court here he or she may be surrendered on the Minister receiving adequate undertakings that the person will be returned here in due course to serve or complete the sentence imposed by the Irish court.  Section 25 also provides that such a person will continue to be liable to complete any term of imprisonment here when he or she has been returned.</P>
    <P>Section 27 requires the Director of Public Prosecutions, before deciding to commence any proceedings under the State's extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of conduct constituting an <Col N="433" /> international tribunal crime, to take into account the jurisdiction of any international tribunal. Where an international tribunal makes a request to the Minister that a court or military tribunal here defer to the jurisdiction of the tribunal by discontinuing proceedings, section 28 provides that the Minister shall transmit that request to the High Court and if the proceedings are being taken under the State's extra-territorial jurisdiction in relation to conduct which constitutes an international tribunal crime, the High Court may order the proceedings to be discontinued.</P>
    <P>It may be that a person who is in the State and is the subject of a request for his or her surrender made by an international tribunal has committed crimes in the State that do not amount to crimes within the jurisdiction of the tribunal.  If that happens, the Minister may postpone under section 20 the period for the making of a surrender order to enable criminal proceedings in the State to be instituted against the person.  In deciding whether to postpone surrender in these circumstances the Minister will take into account the seriousness of the crimes committed here.  If such a person is tried here, found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, it would of course be open to the Minister to order his or her surrender under the Bill on an undertaking that he or she would be returned here in due course to serve the sentence imposed by the Irish court.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the usual provision, in section 26, found in general extradition law, forbidding surrender where final judgment in respect of an offence has been passed here or in another state on the person sought by a tribunal and the conduct constituting the offence also constitutes the international tribunal crime for which his or her surrender is sought.  Unlike our general extradition law, this prohibition will not apply where the tribunal satisfies the Minister that the proceedings in the other state were, in effect, a sham, designed to shield the person from international criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill provides for various forms of assistance in aid of a tribunal's investigation and prosecution of war crimes.  Section 29 provides that section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, shall have effect as if references in that section to drug trafficking included references to conduct constituting an international tribunal crime.  Thus a member of the Garda Síochána may apply to the District Court for an order for the production to a member of the Garda Síochána of material by the person who appears to the judge to be in possession of the material.  Broadly, the application may be made where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a specified person has been guilty of an international tribunal crime and that the material is likely to be of substantial value to the investigation of the crime and that it is in the public interest that the material should be produced.</P>
    <P>Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that there is in any place evidence in relation to the commission of the international tribunal <Col N="434" /> crime, section 30 provides for the issue of search warrants by the District Court authorising entry, search and seizure.  Section 31 provides, following the receipt by the Minister of an order from an international tribunal, for the making by the High Court of orders for the preservation and protection of property or for the restitution of property unlawfully taken by a person convicted of an international tribunal crime.  In effect, the section applies various provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, with necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>Section 32 enables privileges, immunities, exemptions etc. to be accorded to the personnel of a tribunal and to witnesses and counsel appearing before a tribunal and section 33 deals with the transit through the State of a person who is being transported in custody from one state to another for the purposes of an international tribunal.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill creates an offence of interfering with or intimidating an international tribunal witness and, as I have mentioned already, enables regulations to be made applying the arrangements set out in the Bill with necessary modifications to any other tribunal or court established by the United Nations for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed outside the State.  I may explain here that the idea of establishing an International Court of Justice exercising criminal jurisdiction to prosecute perpetrators of crimes against humanity of exceptional gravity and heinousness has been mooted in the United Nations for almost 50 years.  The establishment by the Security Council of two <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals to deal with those responsible for atrocities in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda had the effect of reviving interest in a permanent international criminal court and of galvanising the international legal community into undertaking serious work towards its establishment. A first draft of a statute of such a court was produced by a working group of the International Law Commission in 1993 and the matter has been under discussion since.  The UN General Assembly decided last year that a diplomatic conference will be held in Rome in June and July of this year with a view to finalising and adopting a convention on an international court.  It seems that the climate for the establishment of an international criminal court is now more positive than it has ever been.  This country has been a consistent supporter of the proposal to establish such a court.</P>
    <P>I am proud to bring this Bill before the House. It fulfils an important international humanitarian obligation and is a positive mark of the repugnance we feel at the genocidal atrocities that were inflicted on countless innocent men, women and children in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and a mark also of our determination to do all we can to help to bring to justice the depraved human beings who were responsible.  I am sure all Deputies will agree with the general purpose and thrust of the Bill.  I will listen carefully to and take account of all contributions to the debate and if <Col N="435" /> amendments are needed they will be made.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I welcome this Bill as a means of ensuring that Ireland does not become a haven for those guilty of war crimes in former Yugoslavia since 1991.  Unfortunately, it comes after the massacre of at least 200,000 innocent victims in former Yugoslavia and at least 800,000 innocent victims in Rwanda.  The bulk of these unfortunate people met their deaths as a result of as appalling and sadistic atrocities as those of any previous century.  The sad reality is that a total of one million people died in this instance because the international community was rich in rhetoric but slow to act.</P>
      <P>While I have no problem with the thrust of the Bill the process of dealing with the criminals who perpetrated these crimes against humanity in both countries is not operating with the efficiency one would have wished.  In former Yugoslavia Judge Goldstone, former chief prosecutor of the tribunal being dealt with in this Bill, the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law, abandoned his prosecutor's office because of the pathetic failure of western leaders to act.  He left in disillusionment because &ldquo;A great injustice was done to the victims of genocide in Bosnia&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Manfred Nowak, former chairman of the UN working group on enforced disappearances, also resigned.  Explaining his decision he said: &ldquo;My resignation is based on the experience that there is not sufficient political will to establish the faith [the destiny] of the missing people by all political means&rdquo;.  One of the main platforms on which the Dayton agreement was based and the key to getting the Bosnian Government to agree to the painful partition of the country was the clear unequivocal undertaking that war criminals would be hunted down, arrested and brought to justice.  This promise has not been kept.  While British troops seized a Bosnian Serb and killed another in Prijedor last July and Dutch troops, who are members of the NATO-led SFOR forces, followed this by capturing two Bosnian Croat prime suspects, the reality is that there has been little by way of proactive pursuit of war criminals and few arrests.</P>
      <P>The tribunal we are dealing with today was set up by the United Nations Security Council in May 1993.  Yet it took exactly four years before European newspaper headlines told us on 8 May 1997, in banner headlines, &ldquo;Guilty Verdict in Bosnian War Case makes First since Nuremberg&rdquo;. Four years after its establishment only one person was convicted and seven other suspects detained in the 24 cell detention centre.  The Minister has provided updated figures and referred to 26 people in custody, two convictions, eight people currently on trial and pre-trial proceedings in the case of 16.  The figures are not impressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> For example, ten were added to the list of suspects when in October last year ten Bosnian Croat war criminals gave themselves up voluntarily and were duly whisked through the streets of The Hague in high profile fashion to face proceedings of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The other major plank of the Dayton Accord, the promise that dispossessed refugees would be returned to their lands &mdash; also mentioned in the Bill &mdash; has been allowed to languish.</P>
    <P>In spite of the rhetoric that war criminals would be dealt with effectively, it is worth noting that on the day that the NATO General Secretary warned in the sternest terms that indicted Bosnian war criminals would be delivered to the international tribunal in The Hague if they refused to give themselves up, three of the ten Bosnian Croats who gave themselves up in October were freed by the tribunal because of lack of hard evidence. The Secretary General's line is that it is the responsibility of the political parties to turn in their indicted war criminals.  If the parties do not collaborate with the international tribunal SFOR will do the job themselves.  The reality is much different.  In essence, 200,000 people have died in former Yugoslavia.  Many people were responsible for the plotting, planning and the murder of these people and yet only a handful of the war criminals responsible have been delivered to the tribunal to face the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>Nobody can excuse the execution of the 22 Rwandans last Friday on charges of their involvement in the mass genocide of 800,000 Tutsis. These were executed on convictions handed down by the Rwandan courts under the terms of their genocide law, adopted in 1996.  A total of 330 people have been tried by the courts under this law.  One third of these have been convicted and sentenced to death.  Another one third have been convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Others have been convicted of lesser offences. Only 17 have been found not guilty.</P>
    <P>What seems to have been totally ignored by the international community is that there are 130,000 persons detained in jails in Rwanda accused of genocide awaiting their turn for Rwandan justice. At the present snails pace of progress it will take several hundred years before their cases will be heard by a system where legal training is minimal and objective judgment suspect.  There would seem to be a well founded suspicion that the authorities in Rwanda are using the pretext of genocide crimes to lock up, without trial, anybody it considers undesirable.</P>
    <P>One has only to examine the admittedly horrendous figure of 800,000 dead against the 130,000 detainees to see that there is widespread dragnet in operation.  The conditions are hell-like. Prisons are dungeon-like.  Prisoners are stacked like sardines on bunks.  In Giterama prison, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> journalist, Paul Cullen, for the past four years 7,000 men have been sleeping, standing, washing, defecating and dying beside each other in a jail built to hold 700 <Col N="437" /> people.  He said: &ldquo;In windowless dungeons emaciated prisoners lie on their bunks all day. The stench of faeces fills the air.  There is no room to move about.  The sick &mdash; malaria, TB, AIDS &mdash; sleep cheek by jowl in the same room as the healthy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While these people are accused on terrible crimes against humanity their treatment and the delay in delivering justice is an abomination. While all this is going on and 130,000 persons are incarcerated in such hell-like conditions the Irish parliament spends its day enacting legislation to ensure that if some of this hopeless horde should per chance escape and make their way across the Sahara, the Mediterranean, mainland Europe and arrive here, they will be returned to face proceedings under the UN tribunal.  I referred to the time factor earlier, given that only 330 of the 130,000 detainees have had their cases heard to date in Rwandan courts.  Even that record looks impressive when one considers that the legislation with which we are dealing today, supporting the UN's international criminal tribunal on Rwanda and which sits in Tanzania, has been dogged by corruption and incompetence and has just three genocide trials in progress.  To date it has not secured a single conviction.</P>
    <P>What are we doing as a member of the UN to ensure that an efficient, effective, objective and properly resourced tribunal is put in place to take control of the situation?  Surely we should lead the way or demand that the UN and the EU insist that a timescale and a timetable for deciding who is innocent and who is guilty is put in place and then ensure that people are treated and dealt with according to the judgment handed down.  We certainly cannot stand idly by and allow even more people to be added to this mass of humanity without putting proper procedures in place.</P>
    <P>I do not want to underestimate the scale of the difficulty of dealing with the paranoia of the Tutsi-led minority regime in Rwanda whose fellow tribespeople formed the bulk of those killed by the Hutus.  This country takes a particular pride in the unflinching support for human rights of the UN High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson. She has rightly condemned the Rwandan authorities &mdash; face to face in Kigali &mdash; for arbitrary arrests, prolonged detentions and serious overcrowding resulting in inhumane conditions. We acknowledge her condemnation of the Rwandan authorities for failing to promote ethnic reconciliation by bringing Hutus and Tutsis together.  In the absence of such a policy ethnic war is inevitable and the slaughter will continue.</P>
    <P>However, the UN is only as good as the collective determination of its composite member states, so it is up to us to be the advocates within the UN of the conscience of the international community and to lead on issues.  We are in a unique position to do so &mdash; we are neutral, we do not have vested economic interests and since our success over the last decade has placed us in the top 20 of world economies we are in an even better position to exert influence on international <Col N="438" /> thinking.  Sadly, irrespective of individual expressions of compassion or decrying of human rights infringements or violations, major economic or political considerations have invariably won the day over human rights in virtually every country where conflict has arisen: the mining of Nicaraguan territorial waters; the Scott report's findings on British Government arms sales to Iraq, while its own sanctions were in place; Australia's refusal to condemn Indonesia's illegal invasion of East Timor; and the illegal occupation of Tibet by China.</P>
    <P>Both tribunals we are discussing are focused entirely on those responsible for the war crimes &mdash; the unfortunate 1 million victims have been relegated to the obituary pages of history.  What is being done to establish exactly how many people died?  What is being done to find the missing bodies and restore them to their next of kin?  Who is responsible for restoring the dispossessed and those dislocated or dislodged from their lands? The UN should be active on all these fronts but it is not.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years, as in previous decades, countless thousands of innocent people have lost their lives at the hands of power hungry, feuding factions.  In all cases there was a build up period in which there were ominous indications that conflict was looming.  In many cases the international community saw the inevitable unfolding and did little if anything to head it off; in a minority of cases the conflict was under way before the outside world realised.  An early warning system is needed so that all resources are used to head off conflict and to intervene before it becomes unstoppable.  We need an effective UN advance conflict monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>I welcome both tribunals and Ireland's co-operation with them but, despite the best intentions, their organisation, effectiveness and administration leaves a lot to be desired.  While all this goes on, Algeria suffers unspeakable barbarity &mdash; throats are cut, babies are thrown into cauldrons of boiling water.  These <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals are not the answer.</P>
    <P>What is needed, as the Minister said, is an international criminal court.  The idea has been around since the Nuremberg Nazi war crimes tribunal after the Second World War.  There is no doubt that the absence of a permanent international criminal court made it impossible to try Pol Pot for the genocide of 1 million Cambodians. The absence of an independent prosecution system made it impossible to try Saddam Hussein for using poison gas and ordering the mass execution of rebellious Kurds in 1988.  One hopes the political will now exists and the four countries who have held out against such a court will see it is essential if we are to put in place an international criminal prosecution system and end the <i>ad hoc</i> system of which this measure is a part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I welcome this Bill, which allows Ireland to co-operate fully with the international tribunals <Col N="439" /> established by the UN to prosecute war criminals in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  The Bill was initiated by the last Government which, under the influence of Deputy Spring and Ms Joan Burton, had an excellent record of implementing legislation arising from UN conventions. I welcome this Government's commitment in bringing the Bill speedily to the House.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Bill Ireland will fulfil its obligations to international tribunals.  It recognises that individuals wanted by the tribunal could come to Ireland.  It allows for the arrest and extradition of persons sought by either tribunal and prevents suspected war criminals from applying for asylum in Ireland or describing their offences as political.</P>
      <P>International tribunals will play an important part in promoting peace in the future by securing justice and human rights.  I hope they will ensure the perpetrators of genocide &mdash; especially the high profile leaders of such movements &mdash; cannot escape justice.  This continues to apply to certain high profile individuals who continue to walk free in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that the Government has stalled on the Criminal Law (UN Convention Against Torture) Bill, which is on the list of promised legislation but has not been given priority.  It is not a complex Bill but has been left outstanding for nearly two decades.  I hope the Government moves on that Bill as soon as possible because Ireland must also be active in the efforts to curb torture.</P>
      <P>The establishment of two international tribunals to investigate the genocide in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda is welcome.  It is a positive move by the international community to foster justice following years of bloodshed and destruction.  The Labour Party feels, however, there is a strong argument for the UN to establish a tribunal on a permanent footing, which could quickly investigate future incidences of genocide. This has been a bloody decade in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia &mdash; in 1994 alone, it was reported that over one million people were massacred in Rwanda.  The reaction of the international community was slow and in some cases not helpful.  A permanent tribunal would guarantee that future incidences of genocide elsewhere in the world would be investigated rapidly.  Potential perpetrators of genocide would know in advance that a mechanism exists to bring them to justice.  It would allow the international community an accessible device to which to refer future conflicts.  The case for a permanent tribunal is strong and I call on the Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs to articulate that case at the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the lack of medical and support facilities available to victims of torture. Over recent decades Ireland has received a number of programme refugees from countries like Vietnam and Bosnia, parts of the world torn by conflict.  Many of the refugees suffered torture <Col N="440" /> and other human rights abuses.  The same can also be said of some of the asylum seekers now in Ireland.  Not only has the Minister consistently failed to provide fair, transparent and efficient means to treat asylum seekers, he does not appear to recognise that many of them have suffered torture and human rights abuses.  He has provided no assistance to them to deal comprehensively with their difficulties.</P>

      <P>As a nation we can no longer afford to sit back and allow innocent people to suffer during times of war and oppression.  The problem is a real one &mdash; Ireland is a home for asylum seekers and the immediate enactment of the torture Bill and efforts to make provision for the establishment of a permanent international tribunal are vital.</P>
      <P>The Bill fulfils Ireland's obligation to ensure that those who engage in genocide cannot be comfortable in the knowledge that the international community will not pursue them.  The deterrent and preventive effects of this Bill and the international convention from which it is derived may inhibit at least some of those contemplating genocide.  Ireland will not be a safe refuge for those who may wish to escape answering for their crimes.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is extremely important that we put legislation in place that will enable us to co-operate with the United Nations in pursuing those who are wanted for war crimes.  It is true that the Bill, when enacted, will rarely be used, although its absence would probably encourage those who are being pursued by the United Nations for war crimes to find refuge here.  From that point of view, it is welcome.</P>
      <P>I welcome in particular section 37 which will enable us to make regulations to apply the provisions of the Bill to other tribunals which may be established as a result of decisions of the United Nations.  The Bill, as it stands, will apply only to the tribunals established to deal with war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the efforts made over 50 years to establish an international court of justice. Tribunals were held in the late 1940s and early 1950s to bring Nazi criminals to justice and, to some extent, states have pursued war criminals within their own borders but the failure of the international community to establish an international court of justice which would be a permanent feature of international law is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>We tend to pursue these matters on the basis of the more powerful countries taking cases against those which are less powerful.  The Nuremberg trials were derided by Germans of the day as victor's law.  They claimed that, because the Allies had won the war, they were in a position to pursue Nazi war criminals, as they were fully entitled to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> It is a sad fact that the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was never questioned by an international body or subjected to judicial review.  It constituted a war crime, was totally unnecessary and went far beyond what was required to defeat Japan and the Nazi machine in Germany.  The consequences were appalling.  If there is to be an international court of justice, any crime committed in the course of war should be subject to review, regardless of whether the perpetrators were the losers or victors. War is a crime against humanity.  It is, generally, a failure of politics.</P>
    <P>We should ensure, in so far as we can, that conflicts do not emerge.  We are far better equipped internationally to do that now than at any time in the past.  It is extraordinary that many conflicts now take place over issues of national identity and attempts by various states to extend their borders to establish their homeland incorporating other peoples who do not want to be ruled by a particular ethnic majority.</P>
    <P>We should consider what happened in the former Yugoslavia and compare it to the solution on this island to a similar kind of ethnic allegiance conflict.  The conflict in Northern Ireland between Irish and British nationalists is on the point of being resolved.  I hope the Agreement which has been negotiated will not alone be carried but successfully put in place and operated.  That is the kind of solution to which we, as politicians, not alone have an obligation but the skills to put in place.  There is nothing to be gained from conflicts between peoples over territory and seeking to ensure the territory coincides with what they consider to be the extent of their nation.</P>
    <P>We should look at the Bill in the context of our attitude to refugees and immigrants.  It is conceivable that a number of the people who are regarded as undesirable refugees or immigrants are in the process of escaping the war criminals the Bill is supposed to deal with.  It would be extremely ironic if we fail to deal with them in a humane way.  In general, I welcome the Bill but there is an inconsistency at the heart of the Government's policy on refugees.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure refugees are enabled to make a contribution while here.  Under the procedures in place they are obliged for months and perhaps years to remain idle.  They are not enabled to work or make a contribution to the society in which they are seeking refuge while the process is being completed.  There has been criticism in the media and some political circles that refugees are costing the State money.  It does not make sense to maintain the legal position whereby refugees are obliged to remain unemployed and idle when they are anxious and want to make a contribution to society.</P>
    <P>The Bill is long overdue.  The tribunals with which we seek to deal with in this Bill were established four or five years ago.  However, although it is somewhat late, the legislation is welcome.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate how far advanced is the legislation he promised some months ago to <Col N="442" /> criminalise trafficking in refugees?  When my party, Democratic Left, brought forward a Bill to provide an amnesty for refugees in this State the Minister indicated he was bringing in, as a matter of urgency, a Bill which would make it illegal to traffic in refugees.  The Taoiseach indicated on the Order of Business that the legislation is being worked on but he had no information on how far advanced it is.  It is listed as No. 61 in the list of legislation circulated two weeks ago by the Chief Whip.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for this legislation. There is international evidence that trafficking in refugees is big business and I have no doubt that some refugees have arrived on our shores as a result.  That is not to suggest that the refugees concerned should not seek asylum or help here, but that procedures should be in place to ensure such people can seek refuge in the normal way without having to engage in a criminal conspiracy. Will the Minister indicate how soon we can expect to see that urgent legislation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  We often hear about events in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda on the news.  There are reports in today's newspapers about an Irishwoman, Corporal Lorraine Coss, who was injured while on peacekeeping duties overseas and recuperating in a Sarajevo hospital. Thankfully, she is making a speedy recovery.  She is the first Irish woman to have been injured while on peacekeeping duties.</P>
      <P>Over 20 people were tied to posts and executed by firing squad in a sports stadium in Rwanda in recent days, despite pleas from the international community, which is an appalling indictment of the Rwandan Government.</P>
      <P>While this legislation is welcome, it reminds us we are citizens of our respective countries and also bound together by a common humanity.  Certain crimes are so offensive to the world's conscience that the international community can hold individuals responsible for them, even when the states to which they belong are unwilling or unable to prosecute them.  Most people agree in principle that the international criminal court should be able to try individuals for genocide, war crimes and widespread abuses of human rights. Many nations and groups of legal experts and citizens also want to include aggression among such crimes, as it was in Nuremberg, thus allowing leaders who engage in unprovoked international aggression to be tried.</P>
      <P>Many NGOs have pointed to the fact that most crimes against humanity and genocide committed in violent conflicts around the globe remain unpunished.  The European parliamentarian and human rights campaigner, Gianfranco dell'Alba, has said that although there is strong support for the principle of setting up an international court, there is disagreement among some UN members on its scope and establishment procedures.  This is perhaps one of the reasons for the delay in setting up an international court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> Amnesty International believes states have a primary duty to bring persons responsible for genocide and other crimes against humanity and serious violations of humanitarian law to justice in their own courts or to extradite suspects to courts in another state.  I welcome that statement.</P>
    <P>The background to this Bill is what has been happening in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. There have been long time tensions between the minority Tutsi population and the Hutus, the largest ethnic group in Rwanda.  Genocide began on the night of 6 April 1994 when a plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundian Presidents crashed or was shot down at Kigali Airport, killing both Presidents.  Both men were Hutus, the majority ethnic community in Rwanda and Burundi.  These deaths were the pretext for a well orchestrated and predetermined genocide of the Rwandan Tutsi population.  In the space of a little over three months, almost 800,000 of Rwanda's 900,000 Tutsi population were massacred.</P>
    <P>The African Rights Organisation undertook a detailed examination of the genocide committed in Rwanda.  Its report notes that &ldquo;huge numbers of civilian administrators, journalists, businessmen, civil servants, academics, school-teachers, students, housewives, doctors, nurses, peasants, traders, judges, priests, nuns, staff of local NGOs were involved, both directly and indirectly, in the killings&rdquo;.  The Rwandan tribunal recently told of a hymn sung by assassins as they carried out acts of mass murder on the Tutsi population which stated:</P>
    <P>Is it a sin to kill a Tutsi?  No. Let's exterminate them, exterminate them, kill them and bury them in the forests.</P>
    <P>That is the appalling situation in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>After the death of Tito in 1980 in the former Yugoslavia, labour unrest grew and there was much dissatisfaction with the quality of life.  In 1987 the national leader, Slobodon Milosevic, came to power in Serbia.  Other republics became increasingly alarmed by the possibility of Serbian attempts to dominate them.  In July 1991 Slovenia declared independence.  Ten days of conflict ensued as the federal army tried to prevent secession.  The European Community recognised Slovenia in January 1992.</P>
    <P>The referendum in Croatia in May 1991 in favour of independence led to the outbreak of hostilities between the Serb minority in Croatia and the ethnic Croatian majority.  There was extensive destruction and many casualties throughout Croatia.  Following savage fighting during 1991, the Croat Government and the Croat-Serb minority agreed to accept UN peacekeepers.  The level of violence fell as a result but there were still numerous killings.</P>
    <P>A tribunal in the former Yugoslavia was necessary due to the type of atrocities committed there, which had not been seen in Europe since the era of Hitler and Stalin.  For example, the discovery of a mass grave around Srebenica in eastern Bosnia, <Col N="444" /> where up to 8,000 Muslim men are believed to have been executed by Serb separatists in July 1995, is akin to the horror felt when the mass grave of 12,000 Polish soldiers executed by the Soviets was excavated in 1943.  The stench of fascism emanating from former Yugoslavia must be investigated.  In January 1998 US troops arrested Goran Jelisic, who proudly dubbed himself the &ldquo;Serb Adolf&rdquo; and boasted to the world media about the number of Muslims and Croats he had butchered during the 1992-95 war.</P>
    <P>The names of the centres of mass human destruction in World War Two, such as Belsen, Auschwitz and Treblinka, are synonymous with evil.  Who would have thought that in the Europe of the 1990s we would ever see again such emporiums of death?  The Serb-run Luka concentration camp was one such heinous place.  In their list of indictments, UN prosecutors say that hundreds of Muslims and Croats were systematically killed at the Luka camp in an organised programme of ethnic cleansing.</P>
    <P>In February 1992 an independence referendum was held in Bosnia.  The majority of Bosnian Muslims and Croats voted for independence while most Bosnian Serbs staged a boycott.  The declaration and recognition by the international community of Bosnian independence was followed by a rapid outbreak of violence throughout the republic.  With an ethnically diverse population spread throughout Bosnia, composed of 44 per cent Muslim, 31 per cent Serb and 17 per cent Croat, there was no single front line.  Instead, many pockets of fighting divided towns, villages and streets.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why we should welcome this legislation.  Under UN Resolutions 827 of 1993 and 955 of 1994, we are obliged to co-operate with these tribunals.  This Bill introduces the measures necessary under our domestic law to implement the provisions of these resolutions and the statutes of the tribunals.  The provisions in the Bill contain practical measures, for example, in dealing with arrest warrants, requests for extradition, surrender or rendition and committal or release of the arrested person.  This is necessary for our co-operation with the tribunals in the investigation and prosecution of persons accused of committing serious violations of international humanitarian law and to comply with requests for assistance.</P>
    <P>During our EU Presidency, Ireland played an honourable role in encouraging the process of the tribunals.  In this regard I compliment the work of the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and the then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for development co-operation, Ms Joan Burton, on their work.  We must continue this tradition and ensure that there can be no sanctuary for war criminals.  Every effort must be made to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
    <P>To be an effective member of the UN we cannot confine our actions to passing resolutions and <Col N="445" /> motions at the UN Assembly.  We must also introduce legislation into our domestic law and co-operate with the work of the UN.  In this regard, I congratulate the Minister on his initiative.</P>
    <P>The war tribunals dealing with the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are the first international tribunals for half a century since the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1946.  They are viewed by many as a major test of the UN.  By introducing this legislation we are underlining our commitment to the role of the UN.  These tribunals need unequivocal support to establish the role of justice more generally in defending human rights and strengthening the UN's authority to deal with violations.  By passing this legislation, we recognise the UN's right of arbitration in matters amounting to crimes against humanity.</P>
    <P>In the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda it is important that these tribunals are seen to work and have the support of the international community. Without justice being seen to be done, it is impossible to envisage a return to any kind of political normality.  True reconciliation is impossible until justice is seen to be done.</P>
    <P>As a result of the programmes of systematic genocide undertaken in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, there are hundreds of thousands of war refugees from these countries scattered across the EU, including Ireland.  Successful prosecution of the war criminals will give them the confidence to return home.  While the scale of the genocide was such that it is impossible to bring everybody involved to justice, it is important to bring as many people as possible to justice.  Each time, for example, an individual Bosnian Serb is found guilty, he or she will be judged as a representative of thousands of other Bosnian Serbs involved in the extermination of entire communities of Bosnian Muslims in a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing.  The evidence against such individuals will doubtless help to document the course of that vicious action.</P>
    <P>Just as the Nuremberg trials documented the Holocaust and ensured its victims' suffering will never be forgotten, these tribunals are significant because while the justice may not be perfect, while all the guilty may never be identified and punished and while no punishment can bring back the victims, they expose crimes against humanity which, henceforth, no one can deny.  As recently as 8 April, in a ceremony to commemorate the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan President, Pasteur Bizimungu, called on the EU and Canada to extradite to justice known war criminals living in their countries.</P>
    <P>As a member of the international community, Ireland has a responsibility to bring the perpetrators of the mass killings in Yugoslavia and Rwanda to justice.  While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is unaware of any war criminals living in this jurisdiction, this Bill is important because it provides for such an eventuality. Should any of the butchers of Rwanda or Yugoslavia be found in this country the Government has provided legislation to ensure that no <Col N="446" /> international tribunal crime can be regarded as a political offence and no application for asylum in this State will result in the prevention or postponement of the surrender of a person.</P>
    <P>This Bill will ensure that the likes of Dr. Radovan Karadzic, who spoke in terms of a war of extermination, or Jean Kambanda, the former Rwandan Prime Minister who is strongly implicated in the mass murder of almost 200,000 Tutsis, can never claim in this State that their crimes were political, nor can they seek asylum. The Bill ensures that this State will never be a safe haven for war criminals.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also praiseworthy in so far as it moves beyond the remit of Yugoslavia and provides for similar co-operation with any other tribunal or court which may be established by the UN with a similar remit and which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, by way of regulation, declare to be a tribunal for the purposes of this Bill.  I look forward to the day when an international tribunal sits in judgment of Ta Mok, Pol Pot's commander, and a number of the other architects of the killing fields of Cambodia.</P>
    <P>Pol Pot's final disservice to the people of Cambodia was to die before he was made accountable for the two million lives lost during the Khmer Rouge reign of terror from 1975-79.  I am pleased to note that the Cambodian Genocide Programme, based at Yale University, says it has enough evidence to clearly implicate a number of Pol Pot's closest associates in these heinous crimes against humanity.  Other tyrants and dictators who have committed the most appalling crimes against humanity could also be mentioned.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation, which demonstrates the commitment of the Government to the UN.  I am pleased that, at last, there appears to be agreement among member states.</P>

      <P>This is important legislation.  Credit is due to the Minister and his staff and the parliamentary draftsman.  It represents an important element of modern Ireland.  It is past time we played our part in the area of human rights, both at home and internationally.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I viewed the television programmes on the Nuremberg trials.  The extent of footage on World War II and Nazism shows that the behaviour of Hitler and his generals was appalling.  The EU was established to prevent the recurrence of wars between former enemy countries, such as Germany and France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in the former Yugoslavia a number of years ago before war broke out, I had a conversation with a postman.  It was evident that he, an ordinary citizen of a modern country, was very aware of the political disruption that was about <Col N="447" /> to happen there.  He could signal clearly there would be serious trouble once Tito passed on and that proved to be the case.  This country has an international reputation.  While it is small it is powerful on the international stage.  For generations and centuries we have fought the wars of the world and I hope our difficulty at home is in the process of finally being sorted out.  Generally speaking we have a good record on human rights, but serious breaches occur occasionally.  The rape of a young girl in broad daylight in Cork last week is an example of that.  It is very difficult to legislate for human nature and to keep countries in such a stable position that these outbreaks of violence do not occur.</P>
    <P>I remember attending a lecture given by P. R. Salinger, the former press secretary for the late President Kennedy.  He made a point that with satellite technology and all the information available in military circles, it was perfectly obvious to the US at the start of the Gulf War that Saddam Hussein was about to invade Kuwait.  It could see his troops approaching the border and his divisions moving into place.  That was clearly signalled. He asked why did the then President Bush not telephone Sadam Hussein and tell him that if he crossed the line the US would move in?  We then had the invasion of Kuwait, followed by the Gulf War and a massive increase in arms sales. No speaker has mentioned Algeria.  I read reports in Irish and English newspapers of the inhabitants of entire villages who had their throats cut.  That is an example of the savagery of man to fellow man.</P>
    <P>Our reputation internationally is one on which we could build.  We have a good reputation as a human rights country and in international diplomatic relations.  Calls have been made for a permanent judicial commission to deal with human rights.  A number of countries are opposed to that, for their own reasons, but there is no reason we should not launch a diplomatic push for that. There are always lead-in times to outbreaks of violence.  The postman in the former Yugoslavia could forecast the outbreak of violence there and the Americans could see Saddam Hussein's troops approaching the Kuwaiti border.  In African countries, be it Algeria, Rwanda or Mozambique, information is always available to indicate that explosions of violence are about to take place.  There should be some type of prevention mechanism.</P>
    <P>The UN Commissioner for Human Rights, our former esteemed President Mary Robinson, has gone to Africa on a number of occasions and spoken directly to the people concerned, but they have more or less told her to get lost.  Passing this legislation to assist our work in what the UN is doing is important.  However, it is critically important that the United Nations is not only seen to be in place but that each country plays its full part in making it work.  If regulations are seen to be implemented, people, by and large, tend to obey them and, if they do not, there is recourse <Col N="448" /> to legal remedies.  If all the member countries of the UN do not pay their way or play their parts, there tends to be violations of human rights in various places around the world.</P>
    <P>In Rwanda 130,000 people, including those suffering from AIDS, hepatitis C, malaria and every kind of ailment that afflicts humanity, are jailed in concentration camps.  The justice process there is very slow and there is scant regard for diplomatic advances by UN officials and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights.  We should have an international permanent human rights commission, body or authority to deal with these cases.  There should be far greater analyses and action on information coming to countries like ours and to the UN from trouble spots around the world and clearly signalled places that will be trouble spots.  It will then be a matter of being in a position to take action before these explosions against humanity take place, as in the case of Algeria.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was lambasted for a comment he made about the Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We have read accounts of the horror of atrocities where all the inhabitants of villages had their throats cut and were found lying on roadsides, ditches and hills, but nobody is doing anything about that.  What is the UN for?  Where are the powers that can prevent these atrocities or deal with those who lead them.  Circling the exterior of these atrocities are people who design and manufacture arms and the countries that sell them.  In many cases countries have trained armies to exterminate others and then they have to go in and sort out the whole situation again, as the US has done in many instances.</P>
    <P>I welcome this important legislation, but we should have a permanent human rights commission that other countries would know is in place and ready to act in such cases.  Given that information is now coming to countries through the UN and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, preventive action should be taken to stop many of these things happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I welcome this legislation.  It is important that war criminals should know they have nowhere to hide.  We have seen and read accounts of Nazi war criminals taking refuge in South American countries, Britain and elsewhere after the war.  We have all read and seen accounts of the horrific exterminations that has taken place in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere.  For the most part these horrific crimes are committed by bullies.  It is frightening that in ordinary life those bullies are quite ordinary people.  Studies carried out after the holocaust in Germany indicated that the bullies surfaced when they got power and thought they could not be touched or caught.  A bully is a coward and it is important that those bullies should not find refuge anywhere.  Not only is this legislation punitive, it is also preventative. &ldquo;Bully&rdquo; is too soft a word to describe those people.  The words &ldquo;murderer&rdquo; or &ldquo;international <Col N="449" /> criminal&rdquo; might be more appropriate.  It is important they are not given refuge in any country.</P>
      <P>For that reason I welcome the Bill.  It means Ireland will join the civilised world.  As we saw in the former Yugoslavia, the veneer of civilisation is very thin and can be ripped away very quickly. We cannot be complacent about that.  The former Yugoslavia is a European country.  People were horrified that such crimes could occur in Europe, but we must not forget that 50 years ago such crimes occurred in Germany.</P>
      <P>Two tribunals have been set up by a UN resolution. One deals with war crimes in Rwanda and the other with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia. However, how effective are the tribunals? Can Ireland do anything to increase their effectiveness? Over 200,000 people died in the former Yugoslavia, yet I understand only 26 people have been indicted to date and two have been found guilty.  How effective are the tribunals?  People committed murders and engaged in mass extermination in what was known as ethnic cleansing. Are these people being hunted down and arrested?  It appears that is not the case.  I ask the Minister and the Government to bring all their moral authority and influence to bear on the United Nations to encourage it to engage in hot pursuit of these murderers, thugs and criminals. This is most important.  Otherwise, the only conclusion will be that the criminals are being offered safe havens somewhere.  More can be done outside Ireland because many of these people are still at large.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because it contains safeguards and measures which ensure that the Minister must be satisfied with requests for the arrest, surrender or extradition of such people.  It also contains elements which will ensure people cannot hide behind the veil of political asylum.  The Bill is well formulated and I congratulate the parliamentary draftsman and all those who worked on it.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a direct interest in some of the activities in other countries and I wish a speedy recovery to the soldier who was injured in the former Yugoslavia recently.  Irish soldiers, men and women, go overseas to maintain peace for ordinary people in many countries in which there is conflict.  In the interests of their safety we must ensure that the criminals, murderers and thugs are brought to justice.  As long as they are at large, our people are also in danger.  I congratulate the Government on the Bill which the Fine Gael Party backs wholeheartedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose for which the United Nations was established was to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war by deterring aggression between states and by maintaining international peace and security.  The issue is whether the UN is equipped to meet the current day challenges, most of which involve conflict within rather than between states.  The position in Rwanda is a typical example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> The number of UN troops has increased almost sixfold while over the same period the bill for peace-keeping increased from £400 million to £3.5 billion.  The operation in Cambodia alone cost £1.1 billion.  While these figures are small relative to the spending on defence throughout the world, assessment of each peace-keeping operation represents more money and this must be identified.  Unfortunately, many countries owe the UN a great deal of money.  Russian arrears continue to rise while the US now owes the UN over £1 million.  It is most important that the countries which are committed to peace-keeping ensure the ongoing payment of debts.  This is an important factor.  As a member state which has played a huge role, Ireland should promote that concept.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which covers the arrest and surrender of persons, is most important.  There is much work to be done regarding the formation of the court.  The UN Security Council backed the idea of an international criminal court and the most interesting point is whether the political will exists to bring the court into being.  While five permanent members of the UN Security Council backed the idea of hearing cases against individuals accused of war crimes and genocide, they are divided on how such a court should work.  Four of the five countries, the US, France, Russia and China, consider that the 50 member council should have to give its approval before a case dealing with a major conflict can go to trial.  As each of the five countries have the power to veto proposals, any one of them could block the establishment of the court.  Britain has indicated it wants the court to be more independent of the council and it has backed a proposal that only all five countries acting together could prevent a prosecutor from investigating a case.</P>
    <P>Human rights activists state that the absence of a permanent court made it impossible to try Pol Pot who headed the Cambodian Government which killed one million of its own people in the 1970s and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein who used poison gas against rebellious Kurds in 1988.</P>
    <P>The Canadian general who headed the UN peace-keeping operation in Rwanda wept as he recalled the horror of the 1994 genocide.  The real problem facing the world is that many people appear to get away with such crimes.  There is wisdom after the event and people who carry out atrocities should be brought to trial.  The political will of the world should ensure that they pay the price for their crimes.  The Canadian general, giving evidence to the international criminal tribunal for Rwanda, almost broke down as he related his frustration at his inability to stop the slaughter due to lack of resources for his UN assistance mission in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>The Bill is hugely important and the Fine Gael Party supports it.  Ireland has played a major role in UN peace-keeping operations and will continue to do so in the next millennium.</P>

The most important word in the description of the Bill is &ldquo;obligation&rdquo; because it recognises what Amnesty International recommends foreign governments should do <i>vis-a -vis</i> Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, which is to take an active part in condemning human rights violations and abuses in these countries.  A UN tribunal has already convicted a Bosnian Croat of murdering hundreds of unarmed Muslims in the UN safe haven of Srebrenica during the Yugoslav conflict. Such cases prove that the tribunals can bring justice to the victims of the crimes listed.  Therefore, this gives logical weight to the case for Ireland to participate fully in aiding in any way these judicial proceedings.  However, it is disheartening to see reports that Serb mercenaries have been accused of being involved in the torture of civilians in Rwanda and have escaped the clutches of the law in their native countries for the same offences.</P>
      <P>We should remember that the mandate of the multinational stabilisation force for Bosnia-Her-cegovina will terminate in June.  This will enable many of those accused of mass executions to go free.  Immediate action is required if history is not to document our lack of resolve in bringing the guilty parties to justice.  In July 1997, British troops snatched two Bosnian Serbs who between them had run prison camps in which Muslim and Croats were tortured and murdered.  This successful action which must be encouraged and sustained followed the trial in June of the first defendant under the war crimes tribunal, a man who was the former head of the Bosnian Croat army in central Bosnia.</P>
      <P>To date the tribunal's biggest embarrassment has been that alleged war criminals are enjoying refuge in Croatia, Serbia and the Serbian portions of Bosnia.  Under section 7 those Governments are obliged to fulfil a request by an international tribunal for the surrender of a person, whether or not the offence constitutes an international tribunal crime.  In October last year ten Bosnian Croats were handed over to the tribunal by their Government, but I suspect this is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be appreciated that all six republics of the former Yugoslavia have to cope with first the movement from a socially-owned communist system to one based upon markets, private ownership and decentralised decision-making and second with shifting from a war economy to a <Col N="452" /> peacetime economy.  This obviously leads to difficulties in dealing with the demands of western governments that still see these states as having slack economies.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill many parallels have been drawn between the Yugoslav crisis and that of Rwanda. Resolution 955 was proposed in 1994 to deal with those accused of crimes as in the former Yugoslavia. More than one million people died in the Rwandan genocide, which has continued until today.  Throughout the end of last year Amnesty International received almost daily reports of killings of unarmed civilians in Rwanda, in particular extrajudicial executions by soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated Rwandese Patriotic Army.  On average one family a day was killed, and crops and houses were burnt.</P>
    <P>The UN tribunal in Arusha to bring the organisers of the 1994 genocide to justice is said to be the biggest criminal investigation ever.  Unfortunately, an internal UN investigation in February of last year revealed it has been a shambles, with most of the prosecutors and judges having little training and some of the trials lasting only a few hours.  This is further proof that the implementation of this Bill is necessary.  Despite our distance from East Africa we in Ireland have not always had recourse to justice and we have a deep understanding of the importance of the protection of human rights.  The forced repatriation of Rwandan refugees should not be an option open to governments, particularly those that have borders with Rwanda.  The Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania are two countries that must be aided in order that they can sustain the flow of refugees for whom a return to Rwanda would possibly expose them to human rights violations.</P>
    <P>Rwanda should allow unrestricted and safe access to sights of reported killings to human rights investigators.  The Rwandan authorities should be encouraged to bring accused soldiers to trial and foreign Governments should be encouraged to condemn the killings.  Amnesty International recommends that the Rwandan Government should prohibit extrajudicial executions, publicly condemn unlawful killings and ensure strict control over its security forces.</P>
    <P>This Bill is specific in dating when crimes are to be considered possible to pursue under the tribunal. For Yugoslavia it says &ldquo;since 1991&rdquo;, but for Rwanda it says &ldquo;between 1 January, 1994 and 31 December, 1994&rdquo;.  This may cause problems as the crimes in Rwanda appear to be ongoing.  It is noteworthy that &ldquo;no international tribunal crime may be regarded as a political offence&rdquo;.  The reference to section 56 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, means that the Government is repealing the ability by regulation to modify the Act so as to co-operate with international war crimes tribunals. Article 22 refers to the process used in America whereby cameras can be used to protect the victim's identity.  This may encourage people to come forward.  Article 15 states that the prosecutor of the international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia shall also serve as the prosecutor of <Col N="453" /> the international tribunal for Rwanda.  There are advantages in that but I question whether two separate prosecutors working in close proximity would provide greater attention to each country.</P>
    <P>Despite those small points, this Bill is the most positive way forward in dealing with the problems in the two respective cases from Ireland's point of view.  Past tribunals generally have not been very successful due in large part to disinterest or lack of co-operation from national governments. The horrors of war are as evident today as they have been in our history.  Lest our future generations berate us for not helping to find a solution, Ireland should actively participate in the enforcement of the resolutions of this Bill for the sake of world justice.  There may be guilty parties from the former Yugoslavia in our midst and, if so, we must be prepared to deal effectively with them as required by the articles of this Act.  We cannot stand aside and allow genocide, rape, torture, ethnic cleansing, pillage and murder to take place in any part of the world.  If we do, we will have learned nothing from our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte faoi leith a chur roimh an Bille seo agus aontaím le gach atá ráite ag an Teachta Máire Ní Ainifín faoi.  Is ceart agus is cóir go mbeadh an tír seo lán-pháirteach sna hiarrachtaí chun deireadh a chur leis na coireanna uafásacha seo ar fud an domhain.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, as all speakers before me have done, and particularly the manner in which my colleague, Deputy Hanafin, has underlined our responsibility.  I welcome it as evidence of common action on the part of the international community to deal effectively with awful violations of human rights, particularly in the form of genocide.  In that connection I would like to see common action among the international community in cutting off the supply of armaments and weapons of death to those who perpetrate those awful actions.  We are not as consistent in that as we are in setting up a war crimes tribunal, albeit for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Many regional conflicts, as they are called, could not commence much less last for as long as they have, with awful suffering visited on innocent people in those countries, were it not that some of our partners in Europe or elsewhere, respected members of the international community, supply from their armaments industry weaponry of war and destruction.  Now that we are talking about dealing with international criminals, it is appropriate that in all our discussions, be it at Western European Union or any other level, we remind our partners that we want no part in the supply of weaponry of death to international criminals.  In many cases conflicts would not have lasted as long as they did if the international community did not turn a blind eye, give tacit support or supply weaponry to criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Understandably, we have tended to talk in terms of the horrific sufferings and perpetration of violence in camps, be it in Rwanda, Bosnia-Herzegovina, <Col N="454" /> Croatia or wherever, much as we tend to focus on the camps and the mass genocide of the most horrific regime of all, Nazi Germany. People can be killed in their thousands not only in camps but in bombings of the kind we have seen over the years in Vietnam and such places. When we support actions of this kind it should not go unsaid that we totally repudiate and reject actions that seem to have the cloak of the international community, the killings from the air with mass bombings as distinct from poison gas in concentration camps.  Ireland, in particular, must consistently underline and point this out, especially when any of our European partners are involved in the supply of that awful weaponry.  That is one of the most important contributions we can make. None of us should be reluctant to point this out to them because as partners in these communities we are entitled to do so.  We should also do so at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There is another inconsistency, which was properly stated in the House.  We are not only talking about Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. It has been pointed out, particularly in light of the recent death of the awful criminal, Pol Pot, that the international community and the United Nations recognised Pol Pot as the legitimate leader of the Cambodian people at a time when it was clear he was conducting mass genocide in the killing fields.  Was there a reason? Perhaps it was because Vietnam was a combatant with Cambodia/Kampuchea and they did want to acknowledge Vietnam, which was not within what one might call the glory circle of the European Community or America.  We tacitly acknowledged the regime in Cambodia/Kampuchea.  The most beautiful and kindest people in the eastern world, the lovely Kampucheans, were subjected to the most horrific torture because we, the international community, acknowledged that regime.</P>
    <P>I welcome these moves to bring to justice the perpetrators.  However, we have an obligation to point out that mass bombings, no matter what euphemisms are used to describe them, as in Vietnam where terms such as &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; or other such nonsense were used, are equally reprehensible. It is time we looked at whether those who order and implement mass bombings should be made amenable to international war crimes trials and the test of this international tribunal.</P>
    <P>Because of our membership of the European Union and our consistent role in the United Nations, we are uniquely placed to play a vigorous and consistent role in all this and to point out those inconsistencies.  Who can question the need for a tribunal to deal with the horrific atrocities in Rwanda, former Yugoslavia or the safe havens, such as Srebenica, to which Deputy Hanafin referred?  Who will question those who supply the capacity to perpetrate those awful crimes &mdash; our partners in Europe and sometimes our good friends in America?  That must be exposed and we must start in the United Nations and at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> We are also uniquely placed to support this proposal and to incorporate it in our law for another reason.  We have a tradition in the common law, which is also the basic law of many African countries, or at least a development or inheritance of the common law.  We are also involved in the courts at European level.  The tradition of European law, dating back to Roman law, generally embraces both these traditions in the proper procedures for the trial of criminals. For that reason, Ireland is uniquely placed to play a vigorous and active role in the international war crimes tribunal.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and others who said it was time we had a permanent international criminal court and not only an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal set up to deal with Rwanda, Bosnia-Herzegovina or elsewhere.  We require an international criminal court with all the expertise, precedents and sanctions such an international criminal court can call upon.  If some of our partners in the United Nations are not ready to adopt it, we should constantly and vigorously point out the anomaly or inconsistency of their position.</P>
    <P>Irish personnel, who are experienced in the practice of these laws and the administration of justice in the courts are uniquely equipped to play a vigorous and constant role.  As we now have the privilege of an Irish person holding the position of UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, whatever Government is in place should vigorously pursue an active role by making available to these tribunals our personnel, researchers and advice in whatever way possible.</P>
    <P>I presume the proposal to surrender people who have been charged or convicted to the tribunal for the purpose of trial implies that we will not surrender people for questioning.  I would like confirmation from the Minister on that point.  It is not specifically stated but it appears clear that when we surrender people to a tribunal, it is purely and properly for the purpose of trial and not for questioning because that is an honoured tradition in our attitude to extradition.  When we surrender people from this jurisdiction, where we have our rights, protections and obligations, we do so only on the basis that we are guaranteed that the procedures to which we surrender them will follow the same traditions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the punishments authorised under this international tribunal are those of imprisonment, not capital punishment.  That is vitally important at a time when we must constantly underline the fact that capital punishment is nearly a crime against humanity in that it demeans all those concerned with it.  We acknowledge we have no right to take a life while we condemn others for so doing.  I welcome the Bill and the development of the international laws as a consequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the enactment of this legislation.  The move towards the setting up of an <Col N="456" /> international criminal court to deal with crimes against humanity and genocide, wherever they occur, is important.  It is significant that the only international tribunals we have had to date have, in effect, been imposed by the victors in particular wars.  The only people brought to trial have been those who served in the forces of those who lost the wars in question.  This certainly applied to the tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo after the Second World War.  It could also be said that were it not for the victory of the rebels in Rwanda, the perpetrators of genocide would not be brought to trial but would still be running that country.  Were it not for the military action taken by the rebels in overturning that Government, there would be no basis for having war crimes tribunals.  The same applies to Bosnia where intervention to supply arms to the Bosnians and to support the Croats enabled the Croat-Bosnian coalition to eject Serbian forces from places where they were located.  That in turn enabled a degree of order to be established and people to be brought to justice.</P>
      <P>It is important that we in this House are not unduly naive.  It is not enough just to try people after the event.  We have to ensure that a situation is established in which a trial is possible and that frequently requires military intervention.  People from various aid agencies working here say that the international community must do something to stop particular events which involve killing people.  Invariably, what they are looking for is a military intervention of some kind to stop the killing. Only one power in the world has the capacity to do anything of this nature, and that is the United States.  It is not that other countries are not armed, but the United States is the only one that has the power of projection to airlift troops in sufficient numbers to any part of the world to stop genocide.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons is that in Europe there is no common European defence policy.  This is an idea that is frequently criticised in this House. Members profess themselves to be opposed to a European defence policy.  However, the reality of not having a European defence policy is that each country develops its own individual defence policy. That in turn means that none of them can assemble enough resources to do anything other than provide an adequate armament to defend their own territory or an area within, say, 100 miles of their own borders.  Despite its greater wealth, Europe has not developed any capacity to move troops to another part of the world, so when people call for the international community to intervene in Somalia, the Congo or elsewhere to prevent genocide, they are in effect calling on the United States to do so.</P>
      <P>What I find somewhat anomalous is that the people who are most vocal in calling on the international community to intervene in a particular conflict to prevent genocide in another part of the world are also the people who are most vocal in saying that Ireland should remain neutral in all circumstances.  There is an inherent conflict here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> We cannot say that we want the international community to do something, and at the same time say that all we will do is engage in peacekeeping after the event but will not intervene to stop a fight that is already war.  We have a slightly anomalous idea in our minds about this which we need to think through.  Europe does need to develop a capacity to prevent war, and that means not peacekeeping but peace restoration, and peace restoration does mean putting in troops on the ground who are ready to stop people killing other people, by force if necessary.  Peacekeeping is different; it is coming in when matters have settled down and providing a policing function.  There cannot be peacekeeping unless peace is first established. Ireland has taken the view that it is willing to be involved in peacekeeping but not in peacemaking if military intervention is necessary to contribute to that.  This is an attitude we need to think through.</P>
    <P>It is worth analysing the Rwandan crisis in particular. In Rwanda, one million people were killed in 100 days on a genocidal basis.  In terms of rate of extermination, even Hitler did not equal the efficiency of the genocide in Rwanda. That is the fastest rate of killing of people through genocide in human history.  Yet Europe in its response to that matter was divided.  France, in particular, had supported the government of Major-General Habyarimana.  Other countries, including Ireland, were against him and supported the Tutsi position, to some degree at least, against the Hutu, who were responsible for the genocide.  Europe was divided and could do nothing.</P>
    <P>One of the strong arguments for the Amsterdam Treaty, which I hope Ireland will approve, is that it will set up a common analytical competence to develop a European common foreign and security policy.  In other words, if there is to be another Rwanda in five years' time, it will not be just left to the Quai d'Orsay to decide the French foreign policy, to Whitehall to decide British foreign policy and to Iveagh House to decide Irish foreign policy, and so on, so that we will have 15, 20 or 22 different foreign policies in Europe with 22 different analyses of the situation. If we can, through the Amsterdam Treaty, establish a common European analytical centre for looking at international events, and if there is a single analysis being presented to Ministers whenever they meet in a crisis, which single analysis has been developed over time in a coherent way by a European civil service that is looking at all international events, it is much more likely that, five years from now, France, Germany and Italy will not go off in different directions but in the same direction, and there will be some possibility that Europe will be able to intervene meaningfully to prevent genocide.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about in this Bill is not preventing genocide but punishing people, long after the event in some cases, and the longer after the event it is, the more comfortable it is to punish them.  The French have got around now to <Col N="458" /> punishing Maurice Papon 50 years after the events that occurred in Bordeaux for which he was responsible.  He would not have been prosecuted 20 years ago.  Obviously, the further away one is in time, and the simpler one is able to paint the picture in terms of bad guys and good guys, the easier it is to do this sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this legislation, if it is established as an international tribunal covering all war crimes everywhere in the world, will have some deterrent effect and that is good.  However, it does not take away from the fact that this is still dealing only with the problem after the event, not before it.  It does not prevent genocide.  It punishes war criminals after the event.  We need to develop a system of European defence co-operation that will enable Europe to intervene in a meaningful and well organised way to prevent genocide.  The United States will not be able to act as the world's policeman for ever.  Fundamentally the US economy is rather fragile.  It is very prosperous at the moment because the dollar is the only world currency that is able to draw in the savings of the rest of the world to finance consumption and the development of services in the United States, but fundamentally the US economy is not all that strong in global terms.  I do not believe that 20 years from now the United States will be willing to carry the burden of being the world's policeman and many of those who were very hostile to American interventions in the past may well be regretting that America is not around any more to intervene.  There is something economically inevitable about that.  We have to find another way of maintaining peace on a co-operative basis involving others, and one of the players that has to be involved in maintaining peace is the European Union.</P>
    <P>People will say we do not need power blocs, that we should hand all these matters over to the United Nations, and let the United Nations be the world's policeman with no other intermediaries. I do not believe that is practical.  I certainly agree with the approach of the United Nations being the authorising agency and that Security Council resolutions should be the basis for any intervention that member states make.  That is necessary for a degree of international order and law, but I do not believe the United Nations will ever develop a standing army with the capacity to intervene quickly.</P>
    <P>The United Nations procedures, because they involve intergovernmental co-operation and the agreement of all participants, are so slow that the genocide would be long over before the United Nations could intervene.  We need other means of intervention which are reasonably quick.  That is why Europe needs to develop a capacity in this area. This goes completely against the general opinion here that Europe should not have anything to do with defence.  The reality is that Europe is developing into a federal state which has tremendous benefits but which also has responsibilities, one of which is defence.  There is a large degree <Col N="459" /> of hypocrisy in the calls from people in this country for the international community to do something when we are not prepared to make any contribution towards the development of a European capacity to do something to prevent genocide.</P>
    <P>We should not think that genocide is something which only happens in Bosnia or Rwanda where they speak some strange language and that it is not something which could happen here.  If one adopts the definition of genocide in Article 4 of the Statute of the former Yugoslavia tribunal, it can be safely said that there has been genocide in this country in recent times.  Genocide is defined as killing people because they belong to a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.  The killing of most Catholics in Northern Ireland by the Loyalist Volunteer Force is genocide within the meaning of Article 4.  I also believe the killing by the IRA of retired UDR members was nothing short of genocide.  They were not killed because they were a threat to anyone but because they were Protestant.  That is genocide within the meaning of Article 4.  Genocide has occurred in this country, perhaps not on a grand scale in terms of numbers, but it is nonetheless genocide within the meaning of the legislation.  We should not feel we are somehow superior and that these sort of things do not happen on this island because they do and have.  It is important we show a willingness to deal with them.  One of the great things about the peace Agreement is that we are showing a way of preventing genocide in future by finding a political solution.</P>
    <P>We should, as much as possible, try to anticipate where problems of this nature might arise. It is, unfortunately, the case that genocidal tendencies tend to occur wherever there is some form of economic crisis or where some major change or collapse removes previously existing restraints. The tensions may have been there for generations but some new event can trigger latent genocidal tendencies.  We should look at those parts of the world where the greatest problems are likely to occur in the next five years.  I point the finger in regard to two areas.  Since the beginning of this year oil prices have fallen by 20 per cent and are now at $13 a barrel as against $17 a barrel in January. They continue to fall.  This will have a drastic effect on the economies of some oil-producing countries.  We should be wary of the potential political repercussions of that in countries which are dependent on oil exports.  Algeria is one and we have already seen that there are serious problems there which will be aggravated by the fall in oil prices.  Other countries face similar difficulties.</P>
    <P>Another big change in the world in the past months has been the collapse in east Asia where there has been a huge drop in income, especially in Indonesia and also in Thailand.  Genocide was committed on the Chinese community in Indonesia 30 years ago around the time Sukarno was replaced by Suharto.  There are real grounds for fear that genocide could happen again in Indonesia. We have seen the way the Catholics in East <Col N="460" /> Timor have been the victims of what could be described as genocidal pressure in the sense that the Indonesians want to at least eliminate the ethnic group, if not every individual.  With the added pressure of the economic crisis faced by Indonesia, I believe there will be a tendency for minorities to be blamed as things go badly.  That is what happens whenever an economic crisis occurs. People want to blame someone identifiable.  It is not enough to blame the market or finance or some such abstraction.  Some individual or group must be to blame so that the frustration of the people can be vented on them.  I am fearful that the combination of the collapse in the financial system in east Asia and in oil prices in the past months could create situations of potential genocide in a number of countries.</P>
    <P>While this Bill is most welcome and very important, we must develop a capacity to prevent genocide.  That means the international community must have the means to intervene militarily. At the moment, the only country with that power is the United States.  Europe does not have it.  If Europe wants to play its part in preventing genocide, it must develop a capacity to intervene. It must also develop a capacity to regulate its own arms exports.  At the moment, it is contributing to genocide by searching and competing for orders in countries where there is potential for the arms to be used in genocide.  That must stop but it will happen only if Europe develops a common approach to defence.  It is not possible to say that we want Europe to stop being an armaments supplier while at the same time saying we do not want it to develop its own common defence.  The development of the latter is the best way of underpinning a common approach to armaments to rule out competitive exports of arms to countries in which genocide might be the result of the use to which those arms are put.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, nothing comes for nothing in this world.  When it comes to foreign policy, we seem to believe that everything comes for nothing and that no political or moral price need be paid for anything we want.  There is a price to be paid for preventing genocide and Ireland must be prepared to take on its international responsibilities in a serious way.  Ireland is no longer the poor man of Europe; it is now, <i>per capita,</i> a richer country than Britain.  Whereas five years ago our <i>per capita</i> income was the same as Spain's, we are now 30 per cent to 40 per cent ahead.  We have overtaken Finland and are about to overtake Sweden in terms of income per head.  That is unbelievable to anyone who remembers what it was like before it happened.  We are now a wealthy country and we must exercise responsibility commensurate with our prosperity.  We cannot allow that burden to be borne exclusively by others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate. There was general agreement on all sides that it <Col N="461" /> is important Ireland is seen to fully honour its international commitment to bring forward this legislation.  In doing so, we are showing our abhorrence of the human misery and savagery visited on countless innocent men, women and children in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The Government applauds the efforts to bring to justice those who are responsible for the atrocities which words cannot adequately describe.</P>
      <P>When the Bill is enacted, the appropriate authorities here will have the necessary legal mechanism to arrest, detain and hand over persons found in the State who are wanted by either the former Yugoslavia or Rwandan tribunals.  It is important the Bill also makes provision to enable regulations to be made to apply the terms of this Bill to any other war crimes tribunal or court which may be established by the United Nations in future.  We all hope this will not be necessary in the years to come but, sadly, it is possible that whatever happened in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda could happen again.  Setting up a permanent international criminal court would probably make redundant the establishment of special <i>ad hoc</i> war crimes tribunals of the type with which we are now concerned.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that efforts to establish the international criminal court are now moving ahead apace.  It is hoped that a diplomatic conference in which we will all fully participate, scheduled to begin in Rome on 15 June next and go on for five weeks, will reach agreement on setting up an international criminal court.</P>
      <P>As the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks, Ireland has been a strong supporter of such a court for many years.  We are hopeful we will see an international criminal court sooner rather than later.  Setting up such a court would be a powerful tool in bringing to justice, irrespective of their location, the most serious perpetrators of vicious crime on the world stage.  It would also serve as a permanent and salutary reminder to those contemplating genocidal actions or other such criminal activity that retribution will follow if they go ahead with their evil designs.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some questions raised by Members.  Deputy O'Kennedy asked for confirmation that persons will not be surrendered for questioning.  Under the Bill, suspected persons may be detained but not surrendered.  Persons will be surrendered to be put on trial or put in prison to serve a sentence imposed by a tribunal and for no other purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa raised the question of trafficking in refugees and asked about the legislation to criminalise such activity.  Work has started on the preparation of this legislation and the work has been accorded priority in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Higgins referred to the fact that few persons are arrested and brought before the Yugoslav tribunal.  The Government position on this issue has remained constant since the tribunal <Col N="462" /> was established.  All indicted war crime suspects should appear before the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague to face the charges against them.  With our EU partners, full co-operation by all parties with the tribunal in the effort to bring war criminals to justice is a fundamental obligation which must be honoured if genuine stability and lasting peace is to be consolidated.</P>
    <P>With our international partners we will continue to urge the governments of the region to honour commitments in this area, in particular, the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, who signed the Dayton Agreement on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs. Economic reconstruction assistance to the parties is closely linked to their co-operation in this area.</P>
    <P>In regard to non-Serb indictees, significant progress has been made in the past year in bringing suspects before the tribunal.  Economic pressure has resulted in an increase in co-operation by some authorities in the region and more can be achieved in this way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins raised another query about the recent executions in Rwanda and the unsatisfactory nature of the Rwandan system of justice.  The Government remains concerned about the execution of 22 persons convicted of genocide in Rwanda which took place on 24 April.  Our concerns were expressed directly to the Rwandan Ambassador in Ireland two days earlier, on 22 April, when he made an official visit to Dublin. He was asked to convey those concerns to his government and the day before the executions, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, issued a statement urging the government of Rwanda to exercise the utmost restraint regarding the imposition of the death penalty with a view to its total abolition and expressing concern at these public executions.</P>
    <P>In view of our ongoing concerns about this matter, I assure the House that the Government will continue to make every appropriate effort, bilaterally and in conjunction with our EU partners, to minimise the use of capital punishment as a response to genocide in the Great Lakes region.  We are also continuing our efforts towards ensuring that due legal process is followed in all genocide cases, particularly where conviction carries the death penalty.</P>
    <P>As evidenced by the Bill under consideration, the Government will continue to give its strong support to the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which does not impose the death penalty.  We will do so with a view to making the tribunal a more visible, effective and judicious means of dealing with those guilty of perpetrating genocide in that country.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate and who were so supportive of the Bill.</P>

      <P>When Second Stage of the Employment Equality Bill adjourned on 26 March I had almost completed my initial contribution and I was bringing Deputies through the sections of the Bill.  I had concluded by outlining the provisions in section 83 and I will now continue by outlining the remaining provisions.</P>
      <P>Sections 84 and 85 empower the authority, or a person affected by a collective agreement, to refer the agreement to the director, or on appeal to the Labour Court, where it is considered that the agreement contains a discriminatory term or does not provide for equal remuneration.</P>
      <P>Sections 89 to 91 allow a person who has been awarded compensation under the Bill to enforce the award through the Circuit Court, if the employer fails to make payment within a specified period.</P>
      <P>Sections 96 to 98 deal with offences under the Bill and with certain incidental provisions.</P>
      <P>Sections 99 to 103 deal with supplementary provisions such as obtaining compensation from one source only, empowering the Director of Equality Investigations and the Labour Court to strike out cases which are not being pursued and redress procedures for the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a core element in our Department's strategy to develop a framework for equality on a broad front.  It is a fundamental step in the process towards the elimination of discrimination. Deputies can be assured I will be appreciative of all constructive suggestions for improvements to the Bill which they may put forward.  What is required is a law which works and which provides protection for those whom it is intended to protect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  While I regret the long delays in bringing it forward, it is appropriate that we are debating these provisions in parallel with preparations for the 22 May referendum on the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commitment to human rights and the <Col N="464" /> development of a legislative framework which upholds such rights is spelt out clearly in the Agreement.  Enhanced employment equality and new equal status legislation are just two of the pillars we in the south are committed to building. I trust that with this legislation enacted we can move on quickly to the Equal Status Bill.  It is of particular importance that the human rights commission promised in the Agreement should be established as soon as possible.  There would seem to be no reason to delay such a development.</P>
    <P>The strong commitment to equality of opportunity in the Agreement has many dimensions. Placing such rights in the context of an overall commitment to human rights reinforces the importance and centrality of these issues.  As someone who has long campaigned for women's rights in this context, I welcome the explicit inclusion of a reference to women in the Agreement, to the gender dimension of equality rights and our right to full and equal political participation.</P>
    <P>The legislation we debate today is just one step in copperfastening women's rights and widening the circle of those whose rights must be protected. However, the goal of women's equality is still to be achieved and in creating a more inclusive and fair society on this island, it is essential not to lose sight of this or allow women's equality to be pushed into second place.  There is no hierarchy of equality.  All the human rights dimensions have equal importance and the participation of women is a vital ingredient in the development of our economic, political, social and cultural growth.</P>
    <P>The pace of progress of this legislation has been tortuous.  It is vital, long overdue but essential legislation.  I spoke to a young woman yesterday who had looked at the legislation.  She was surprised that it was not already on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>As we approach the new millennium, one can readily understand why a young woman would be surprised this legislation is not already on the Statute Book.  Our knowledge of the need for change in this area goes back to the time when the current Taoiseach was Minister for Labour.  It is disappointing it took so long to deepen the legal framework and extend protection in this area.  I acknowledge, however, the work of the current Minister, the Minister of State and the staff in the Department who have had to deal with the difficulties of the Supreme Court judgment.  The legislation has come back to the House quickly.  Many Ministers from both sides of the House have engaged in the long process of widening the powers and broadening the scope, but there has been a failure to do so speedily. When necessary, urgent legislation has been enacted within months, if not weeks.  Why did it take so long to introduce legislation guaranteeing equal treatment to citizens?  Why did it face so many barriers?  What does that tell us about the House's priorities and about attitudes to the protection <Col N="465" /> of human rights?  I raise those questions in the context of the Agreement on Northern Ireland.  That thinking underpins a great deal of that Agreement.  We should not be complacent about the pace of progress we need to make if we are to underpin the thinking, principles and philosophy in that Agreement in all our legislation. We do not accord this fundamental principle the priority it deserves.  I hope this is the last time important rights that need to be copperfastened remain unprotected for so long.</P>
    <P>The environment in which this legislation is designed to operate is very different from that which prevailed when the original 1977 law was enacted.  At that time women were the exception in many areas of the workforce.  Thousands ceased to remain in paid employment when they had a child and a great many fewer had the benefits of complete second and third level education. Today girls have totally different expectations of life and careers.  Many more wish to combine motherhood and paid employment, taking time out for full-time child care for short periods.  The mushrooming of adult and second-chance education means that more women are able to take up education and gain new skills.  The underfunded but welcome NOW programme and other EU equality initiatives have opened up more opportunities for women.  In a generation the woman's place has become women's places and while progress is far from evenly benefiting all women, our experiences today are generally very different from those of our mothers.</P>
    <P>The rest of society has not kept pace with this change.  We want to confirm the concept of equal rights in the workplace for women, but we still fail to provide child care, family friendly working environments, appropriate parental leave and a range of other necessary practical supports.  If we want women to enjoy equal rights we must recognise that they will exercise them in a way that is relevant to their life experiences.  For many an essential part of that life experience is motherhood and it should be possible to combine participation in the paid workforce with this essential role without the stress or pressure created by an unwieldy and rigid system which assumes a clear divide between the public and the private.  While extending the law and enacting the equal status Bill &mdash; when it eventually re-emerges &mdash; is fundamental in this regard, practical changes, which match the legislative aspirations with reality, are also fundamental.</P>
    <P>The social partnership shares joint responsibility in making these changes.  I expect the Government to take a lead in influencing change, in developing policies and incentives and in ensuring that, as an employer, it is committed to delivering on the rights it enshrines in law.  With only a short time until the negotiations on the successor to Partnership 2000, I expect that opportunity will be used to demonstrate a national commitment to equality between women and men and among all citizens.  I have already emphasised the importance of enshrining the protection <Col N="466" /> of human rights in legislation.  I hope, as agreed under the peace Agreement, the Taoiseach will publish a timetable for the enactment of legislation in this area.  The UN torture convention, the race convention and Protocol 7 of the European Convention need to be addressed urgently.  This legislation should form part of a package.</P>
    <P>It is striking to note the Bill moved through the former Departments of Labour and Equality and Law Reform and the current Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The range of work done by the Department of Equality and Law Reform was impressive.  In contrast we should review how equality rights have been protected and developed in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  While I do not mean that in a negative sense, we must assess whether the mainstreaming of equality rights is working effectively as opposed to when the matter was dealt with by a separate Department. Documentation in that regard should be published.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been referred to the Supreme Court and trawled for constitutional problems.  It has done a through job, with some surprising recommendations in a number of areas.  Under the referral procedure, even though a Bill might be 95 per cent perfect it has to be dealt with again from the beginning.  In contrast, if a Bill is found to be constitutional it cannot be challenged again. Is that the best mechanism or should the Constitution Review Group examine the matter to determine if there is a better way to deal with the issue?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that property rights have been found to have greater authority in our Constitution than individual human rights.  As we move towards the new millennium perhaps it is time to move from the protection of land to the protection of people in our Constitution.  This is particularly relevant when one considers the disability provisions in this Bill, the tone of the Supreme Court judgment and the matrimonial homes Bill.  When the Constitution was drafted it reflected a culture that emphasised the importance of the protection of property above everything else.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a wider constituency.  It has taken us many years to recognise that discrimination cannot be tolerated where the lives, livelihoods and potential of one group of people are sacrificed or diminished while others are enhanced.  There is nothing natural in a civilised society about excluding large numbers of people from all sorts of opportunities.  To continue to allow discrimination would make a clear statement of intent; privileges are to be accorded simply because a person is, for example, male, white, able bodied heterosexual and settled.  That statement sounds ridiculous, but it reflects reality for many.  The experience for many women, travellers, people with disabilities, people who are gay or lesbian or refugees is the converse.</P>
    <P>Some of the discrimination is blatant and direct <Col N="467" /> and much of the rest is subtle and difficult to expose.  The legislation will at last provide a foundation for case law to be developed.  Case law is essential.  The courts will be able to give meaning to our objectives and to ensure that people who have a case of discrimination will be able to exercise their rights.</P>
    <P>We are struggling to come to terms with living in a diverse society, leaving aside the social imperatives of conformity which were so intense at late as the 1960s.  What underlies the prejudices experienced by travellers, refugees seeking asylum, people who are gay or lesbian or by someone with a disability is our fear of difference, and this is frequently rationalised.  Prejudice against travellers is often highlighted as a concern about crime, as if all travellers were criminals.  Prejudice against people of colour is often highlighted as a concern about their being illegal immigrants milking the system.  Prejudice against people with a different sexual orientation is often highlighted as concern about the possibility of child abuse and prejudice against people with disabilities is often highlighted as concern about their not being able to cope.  Those prejudices lead to discrimination and this law will help to expose it.</P>

      <Quest>the best estimate available of the number of self-employed who were over 56 years and had to pay PRSI on the extension of social insurance to the self employed in April 1988; the estimated number of those who have in the meantime qualified for non-contributory pensions; the number of those who have been refunded 53 per cent of their contributions; if a pro-rata factor has been included in previous estimates of the cost of payment of contributory pensions to those self-employed who made contributions since 1988 and have been denied payment of any pension; and, if so, the way in which this pro-rata factor has been included.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10195/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that there could have been up to 20,000 self-employed people over age 56 when PRSI was extended in 1988 who are registered for PRSI purposes.  As I indicated recently during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill and in earlier replies to parliamentary questions, the net additional cost of paying a <Col N="468" /> full rate old age contributory pension to all this group would be of the order of £50 million per annum, equivalent to a capitalised cost of some £475 million over the full period of the payments.</P>
      <P>The £50 million estimate is based on the payment of a full rate of pension and qualified adult allowance where applicable to this group and takes account of the value of the free schemes.  It is an estimated net cost as it assumes that about half of the group could already be in receipt of another social welfare payment, for example, a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House, it is very difficult to get estimates of the numbers and likely costs in this area.  I assure the House that I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.</P>
      <P>The condition that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age before he or she is eligible to qualify for the old age contributory pension has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of this condition is to ensure that entitlement to the pension is limited to those who have made a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of their careers.</P>
      <P>This ten year condition was supported by the Pensions Board and it is considered to be a reasonable condition.  The amendment in the 1997 Social Welfare Act regarding the payment of refund of contributions to this group, which was agreed by the Deputy's party, effectively re-emphasised the position of the ten year test.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that any self-employed person who has contributed and does not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory pension receives a refund of the pension element, 53 per cent of his or her PRSI contributions with interest, which is a fair arrangement.  The position is that self-employed people over age 56 in April 1988 were not excluded from social insurance at that time, as a number of members of this group had earlier class A insurance as employees which they were able to combine with their insurance as self-employed people, class S, to qualify for a pension on retirement.  The exclusion of this group in 1988 would have disadvantaged this group.  The reduction in the yearly average condition from 20 to 10 years from November 1997 has also been of advantage to this self-employed group.  In addition, those with three years' insurance are qualified for a widow or widower's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a total of 3,874 applications for refund, of which 2,868 have been paid to date amounting to more than £2.5 million plus interest &mdash; an average of £900 per person.  A pro-rata factor has not been included in the £50 million cost estimate.  While such an approach would reduce the overall cost, it is clear the cost is still significant and could only be considered in a budgetary context where the proposal would have to be assessed against other competing <Col N="469" /> demands in the social welfare area.  A person who is not entitled to a contributory pension is entitled to a non-contributory pension, subject to a means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is justice in the case I am making on behalf of those who were obliged by law to make contributions to a pension fund and who, because of their age, are denied the possibility of getting any such pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation created an anomaly. However, the National Pensions Board looked at this issue and strongly came down in favour of having a basic ten year rule on contributions. It recommended that refunds be made and the then Government, of which the Deputy's party was a member, accepted its recommendations. In its report on the extension of social insurance to self-employed a number of years ago the National Pensions Board stated: &ldquo;If persons retire at age 66 after a period of less than ten years since entry into insurance under the new arrangements they should be entitled to a refund of the element of their contribution attributable to old age pensions provided that they do not qualify for a pension on the basis of the contributions already made or on a means test basis. If persons who had already received a refund of contributions apply and qualify for means test old age pensions the amount refunded should be deducted in full from such persons' pension entitlements.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During Second Stage debate in 1988, the Minister stated that he accepted the advice of the National Pensions Board and would make the necessary regulations.  However, the issue of refunds and the recommendations of the National Pensions Board were based on the fact that there would be a ten year entry rule which would remain in place.  As I said at a previous Question Time, this issue is exercising a great deal of the time of my officials to see whether there is any way in which we can address it.  The figures are quite dramatic: an annual cost of £50 million with a capitalised value of £475 million.  If there was to be a <i>pro rata</i> pension, as the Deputy suggests, the cost would be less than £50 million but it would still be extremely costly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That it should take five minutes to respond to a simple question as to whether the Minister sees any justice in the case made is alarming.  When replying to the next question, whether he thinks there is justice in this campaign, perhaps the Minister would say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Will the Minister agree that the cost figures have been scaringly overstated from the beginning?  We are talking about a unique group who were aged over 56 in April l988 and who were forced to make these contributions.  Everybody else will have the opportunity of getting the ten years but this group did not.  Will he accept that the figure for costs quoted, initially £756 million, <Col N="470" /> has been deliberately overstated given that an honest effort has not been made to quantify the actual cost?  I suggest the actual cost would be no more than about £20 million per year.  The Minister's figure of £50 million is based on the payment of a full rate of pension.  I am not asking for the full rate but <i>pro rata.</i>  If a person has five years' contributions out of ten he should be given a 50 per cent pension.  That is fair.  If he is seeking more he will not have my support.  I am talking about a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  In relation to adult dependent allowance, is it not accepted that most of the adult dependants would not qualify because of the means limit?  In relation to the free schemes which he is adding in, does he accept they will be entitled to free travel on reaching the age of 66?  Will he accept his figures are deliberately overstated for the purpose of denying a just claim on behalf of this tranche of people, who were forced by the State to make contributions to a pension on reaching the age of 66?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This was one of the issues we considered in Opposition.  In our programme for Government we indicated we would examine carefully the possibility of relaxing the position. The far side of the House does not have a monopoly on worry about this issue.  Irrespective of what party was in Government in the past ten years, including the Deputy's party, Labour and Democratic Left, it has been unable to deal with this matter.  I ask where the priority lay in regard to this issue.  My predecessor, Deputy De Rossa, when asked whether there should be a <i>pro rata</i> pension at a reduced rate, said, &ldquo;I am not aware of any insurance company which would give a person a 50 per cent pension on the basis of contributions made over five years.  It would be an extraordinary generous measure.  It would also be unfair to the millions of people who made contributions from their weekly wages all their working lives to guarantee a contributory pension when they retired&rdquo;.  He went on to say, &ldquo;I am not prepared to give commitments of this nature&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an issue which has exercised a number of Governments.  The previous Government looked at this matter and felt all it could do was to fulfil the recommendations of the National Pensions Board which was, in effect, to give refunds of the pension element of the payments these people had made &mdash; 53 per cent, the balance of 47 per cent being retained by the State to cover widow's and orphan's pensions.  I estimate there are 20,000 people involved.  It may well be that many of those people would be entitled to a non-contributory pension.  Even if the Deputy can convince the Department that we should introduce a <i>pro rata</i> pension at whatever cost, it would be less than £50 million.  Even if the cost were £20 million or £25 million it would have to be balanced in respect of all the other demands in my area such as the carers, people with disabilities and so on, all of whom must be borne in mind as priorities for the spending of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>I accept this issue will not go away.  That is the reason I committed myself at previous Question Times as I have done today.  I have indicated that I asked my officials to prepare a paper indicating the actual cost.  I expect to see this paper in the near future.  Astronomical figures of £750 million were provided but they have been revised down to a capitalised cost of £475 million.  That figure is still substantial and takes into account the possibility of savings in one area because people would be entitled to non-contributory pensions.  This issue is to the fore in my Department and I expect a paper to be presented to me shortly indicating the possibilities.  At the end of the day I may not be in a position to do anything in that this issue is costly and would have to be weighed up in the list of priorities in relation to all the other issues such as carers, people with disabilities and all the other sectors in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The one parent family payment administered by my Department provides income support to unmarried and separated lone parents whose circumstances entitle them to payment under this scheme.  This scheme replaced the separate schemes of deserted wife's benefit and deserted wife's allowance which were abolished on 31 December 1996.  Persons benefiting under the latter schemes had their entitlements preserved where this was more advantageous to them.  A total of 30,400 separated persons are receiving income support under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Social Welfare legislation, a person has a legal responsibility to support his or her spouse and dependent children.  In cases where maintenance is not being paid or is paid irregularly, my Department meets the income support needs of the dependent spouse and children under the schemes mentioned.  In these circumstances, the other partner is legally liable to contribute to the cost of the payments and the Department has powers under the Social Welfare Acts to seek a contribution towards the payments.  In implementing this provision the Department has concentrated on those cases where the liable relatives concerned, being in employment or self-employment, appear to be in a better position to make some contribution towards the relevant benefit or allowance to their families.  This has <Col N="472" /> proved to be a difficult and protracted process. However, out of a total of some 6,700 such cases, over £2 million has been collected from some 500 liable relatives through this system.</P>
    <P>It is intended to continue with the development of this process, particularly in relation to those who are defaulting on their contribution obligations and with a view to the institution of civil proceedings for recovery of arrears in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>In addition to separated persons the maintenance liability provision now also applies since May 1997 to lone parents who are unmarried. The persons concerned are being advised of their obligation to seek maintenance in these cases and follow up action will be taken as appropriate.</P>

      <P>This issue is causing great concern and hardship to many families, including single parent families.  The Minister said payments were being made by 500 out of 6,700 spouses.  The others have neglected to support their families.  A person on social welfare might not be in a position to support his wife or child but many of these men are working and could afford to contribute towards bringing up their children.  The cost of child care is huge and prevents many mothers from continuing their education, returning to work or even getting a few hours off during the week.  Can one imagine what £20 per week from the deserting spouse would mean to a single mother bringing up a child on £82.70 per week?  The health boards are playing their part by supplementing rent allowance, but at a huge cost.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on the Department to follow up those who neglect their spouses and children. Child poverty is a huge issue and we must address it.  Many lone parents receive support from their families but others do not, perhaps through no fault of theirs &mdash; the family may not live nearby or the parents may be deceased.  Many of them live in terrible circumstances while the children's fathers have plenty of money to have a good time. Many such fathers were on social welfare when they became fathers but have returned to employment since the increase in employment. Are these people being followed up and will the Minister give a commitment to compel them to give support to mothers and children?  Unless we make them responsible they will feel they can have several families without taking responsibility for them.  If they are not made contribute to the cost of bringing up those children, they will think they might as well be irresponsible because it costs them nothing and the Department will pay. I understand the Department and the Minister are under severe pressure, but he will agree that thousands of fathers are neglecting their responsibilities and we must follow them up.  How is this being policed?  Is extra funding being put towards it?  In the long run it would save the Minister's Department and the Department of Health and Children a great deal of money if these people were tracked down.</P>

      <P>They are being followed up. This move is based on the 1989 Act.  Since its provisions came into force in November 1990, 23,000 payment cases have been examined to determine the spouse's liability to make contributions.  It was found that in 25 per cent of these cases there was no trace of the errant spouse, 46 per cent of such spouses were receiving social welfare payments and 29 per cent were either employed or self-employed.  An effort was made in respect of the latter group because that is where the best gains would be made but a balanced approach must be taken.  We are obliged to recover the money but we must appreciate there are difficult circumstances.  As the Deputy will see from those figures, almost half of these separated spouses were on social welfare so there would not be much money to collect from them as liable relatives. It is only among the employed and self-employed that there would be a follow up.  I assure the Deputy that the Department is making a definite effort to follow this up.  Some 23,000 cases were examined out of a total of 30,000 separated spouses.</P>

      <P>When were those figures compiled?  It was found that 46 per cent of these people were on social welfare but unemployment figures have been going down so a proportion of that group would probably now be working.  This proves my point that it is the disadvantaged who are suffering, and they are becoming more disadvantaged because they have nothing to fall back on.</P>

My Question No. 3 relates to arrears of payments; it affects many people and I considered it important enough to be given priority status but it cannot now be taken either as a Priority Question or in ordinary time.  That was not as a consequence of long questions from me.  The House should not always have to endure the long replies read out by Ministers.  More importantly, perhaps Standing Orders should be changed.  It is ridiculous that an Opposition Deputy who wishes to raise an important Priority Question should be precluded from so doing.  Will you raise this formally with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with a view to changing Standing Orders.  I also apply to withdraw this question and to re-submit it as the first Priority Question for the <Col N="474" /> next day on which the Minister takes oral questions.</P>

      <Quest>if he will extend the free travel scheme to all widows and widowers over the age of 60 given that some widowed persons in that age group are now in receipt of this concession.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  In addition, widows and widowers between the age of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had entitlement to free travel retain that entitlement.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  At the end of last January, about 505,000 people qualified for free travel at an annual cost of £33 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more than 95,000 persons in receipt of a social welfare widow's or widower's pensions. Free travel passes have been issued to almost 75,000 widows and widowers at a cost of £5 million per annum.  This includes an estimated 2,100 people in receipt of free travel based on their late spouse's entitlement.  However, it is not known how many of these passes are in use.  The cost of extending free travel to all widows and widowers over the age of 60, regardless of the source of <Col N="475" /> their income, is estimated at more than £5.5 million.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that widows and widowers, as a group, are not treated well under the system and that we should try to ensure, unless the cost is unreasonable, that schemes such as the free travel scheme are extended to them?  Is it not unfair that some widows and widowers over the age of 60 qualify for free travel while others, solely related to the date of death of their husbands, do not?  Will the Minister accept that this is an anomaly which should be rectified?</P>

In the recent budget widows and widowers over the age of 66 received an increase of £5.  This was a welcome development.  Widows and widowers under the age of 66 received an increase of £3.  In the Finance Act the Minister for Finance made substantial changes to the taxation code to assist widows and widowers.  In the context of the forthcoming budget in December, I will be looking at the difficulties of widows and widowers with a view to ameliorating their situation within budgetary constraints.</P>

The number in receipt of the one parent family payment is 151, giving a total of 20,560.  The cost of free travel per person per annum is £66.

The estimated full year cost of extending the free travel scheme to all widows and widowers over the age of 60, regardless of their source of income, is of the order of £5.4 million or £5.5 million.  Based <Col N="477" /> on the 1996 census figures, the number of widows and widowers over the age of 60 is 157,350.  The number of widows and widowers who qualify for free travel is 74,766.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost 13,000 appeals were dealt with at the social welfare appeals office in 1997.  The average time taken to process all appeals was 22 weeks.</P>
      <P>There are 5,491 appeals on which work is in progress.  These include cases at all stages of the appeals process, including those which have been heard and decisions are about to be notified, those under investigation in the Department following submission of the grounds of appeal, those awaiting attention by appeals officers and those awaiting further information from appellants.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is quasi-judicial and the procedures are designed to ensure every appeal receives full and adequate consideration.  There is an inevitable timelag in such a process.  In some cases an additional delay may arise because of difficulty in obtaining all the information required by the appeals officer.  In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of information supplied by the appellant and the deciding officer without recourse to an oral hearing and these take less than the average time. Where an oral hearing is required, however, an additional delay is inevitable.</P>
      <P>Four additional appeals officers were appointed during the second half of 1997 and this has brought about an improvement in the processing times for appeals so far this year.  The average time taken is now 21 weeks.</P>
      <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the social welfare appeals office.  At all times it is necessary to ensure progress is achieved in a manner consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal is fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister agrees because, according to my information from the appeals office, family income supplement appeals are put on the long finger.  They are not regarded as a priority by the appeals office which feels that queries on other issues are more important and should be dealt with first.  I have first hand experience of a family income supplement appeal which has been ongoing for almost 12 months.  That is totally unacceptable when, as the Minister agrees, family income supplement is such an important part of some families' weekly income.  Will the Minister ensure changes are made in this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made quite a serious allegation.  If he knows of any instances where there has been an inordinate delay in such appeals he should bring them to my attention.  He indicated that he felt these appeals were being put on the long finger on purpose.  I do not accept that is the case but I will double check the situation and undertake to ensure a report is made to me on the issue of family income supplement.</P>
      <P>In my experience, this is a good appeals system in comparison with, for example, the social security appeals tribunal in the UK where, according to its 1996 report, an appeal took an average of 26 weeks.  The international social security association report in respect of 22 countries said an appeal took on average from three months to 20 months to process.  We are on the lower end of the scale in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the appeals office is doing its best and I have always found its officers to be extremely courteous.  However, I would not like to think that appeals in one sector would take longer than those in another because they all involve family income and should be treated equally.  Will the Minister obtain information on the different heads of appeal, how long different appeals take and whether there are any discrepancies; in other words, if different types of payment from the Department are treated differently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>I will undertake to have that matter looked at in my Department and to have a report made to me.  I am almost sure all those figures will be in the annual report.  I agree fully with the Deputy's remarks on how people are treated by the appeals office and I do not accept that one area is discriminated against.  However, I will have the issue checked as the Deputy has raised it in the House.  Some 49 per cent of appeals which go to the appeals office are decided in favour of the appellant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment action plan has been prepared in the context of the adoption by all member states of the 1998 EU employment guidelines.  It details the integrated range of initiatives which are being pursued by the relevant Departments and Government agencies. These have the aims of boosting job creation, tackling unemployment, alleviating poverty, strengthening equal opportunities, developing entrepreneurship, reducing early school leaving, promoting better provision of child care facilities and providing increased opportunities for people with disabilities to access employment.</P>
      <P>My Department will have a key role in the implementation of the plan.  In particular, the plan details the measures designed to ensure unemployed people will have real incentives to take up training and employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>These measures include, for instance, the expansion of the back-to-work allowance scheme from 22,000 to 27,000 places, in line with the recent budget.  More than £140 million will be spent this year on this very successful scheme, which has been applauded by employers and employees, and on the area enterprise allowance for self-employed people.  There is also reform of the family income supplement scheme which, from October of this year, will be calculated on the basis of net income rather than on gross income, thus providing a greater incentive to workers in low paid employment to remain in work.  Also, the development of the back-to-education programme encourages unemployed people to acquire the self-esteem, education and skills required to participate actively in the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan sets out a two pronged approach to tackling unemployment.  On the one hand, it maintains a strong focus on the needs of the long-term unemployed and underlines the necessity for continued efforts to enhance the employment prospects of this group.  The back-to-work allowance and back-to-education schemes are clear examples of effective measures in this area.  On the other hand, the plan recognises it is equally important that a preventive strategy is adopted to <Col N="480" /> ensure the drift into long-term unemployment is tackled early and effectively.  My Department will co-operate closely with FÁS and the local employment service in encouraging young people into employment and training.</P>
    <P>The employment action plan details how in excess of £1 billion will be spent this year with the aim of giving people the opportunity to secure sustainable employment.  It represents a clear demonstration of the Government's intention to ensure all sectors of the community are enabled to participate and share in the fruits of our economic growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the many worthy objectives in the employment action plan.  However, given that we are debating today the Employment Equality Bill which deals with the rights of people in employment, is the Minister satisfied the budget for this initiative, which I understand is about 1 per cent of the total budget, is adequate given the extent of unemployment?  Unemployment is the biggest issue in the lives of those whom it affects.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister foresee the action plan involving, as has been reported, withdrawing unemployment assistance from anyone who turns down offers of work, even very low paid work? Given the absence of a minimum wage, many of those people will be offered very low paid jobs. Can the Minister allay those fears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly allay the fears of anyone who is under a misapprehension.  The plan, in effect, gives a commitment that we will devote substantial resources to enabling the long-term unemployed to acquire skills, education and self esteem.  The element of my Department's budget devoted to employment and unemployment in 1992 was only 1 per cent with regard to proactive measures.  Following budget changes which I made it is now up to 16 per cent.  It has become progressively bigger over the years.  Mine is not only an income supplement but a proactive Department, which complements the work undertaken by FÁS and the local employment services.</P>
      <P>The idea of the plan is to introduce systems which would interact with all people under 25 years of age and who have been on the register for six months with a view to offering them a job or other employment support.  This approach would be gradually extended on a phased basis to those aged over 25 years who have been on the register for 12 months.</P>
      <P>The determination of the stipulation &ldquo;genuinely seeking work&rdquo; is one of the issues relevant to my Department.  I am in the process of finalising regulations in this regard which, in effect, will only put into writing what has been the practice over the years.  I have had wide consultations in this regard and I hope to introduce them in the near future.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts. The practices in the past have varied and I am not aware if there is any consistency.  Can the Minister provide further details on what the plan will offer the long-term unemployed over the age of 25 years?  He mentioned that they will have had to be unemployed for 12 months and that the emphasis was on those under the age of 25.  Can he indicate whether he will make recommendations to Cabinet &mdash; the issue relates to other Departments &mdash; on work sharing, shorter working weeks, the recommendations on a guaranteed basic income scheme, which we are awaiting, and interim measures in that direction?  Is this latter aspect being pursued in the proactive part of his Department?</P>

      <P>The general thrust of the plan is broken down into a four pillar framework based on improving employability, developing entrepreneurship, encouraging adaptability and strengthening equal opportunities.  Since the Government took office the unemployment figures have dropped from 254,000 to approximately 231,000, which is effectively the lowest figure since 1990.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issues in this plan which are relevant to my Department, we will look at tax and welfare wedges and the removal of employment disincentives.  On the issue of people aged under 25 years, we are looking at the development of the youth progression programme and its extension to the older cohorts.  We will offer training, education, community employment or a job.  Similarly, we will strengthen the back to work allowance scheme and the area enterprise allowance scheme, which are very successful.  The plan is a statement of the Government's intent to address the problem of long-term unemployment, which we acknowledge continues to exist.</P>

      <P>The report of the Pensions <Col N="482" /> Board on the national pensions policy initiative will be published by the board on 7 May.  The national policy pensions initiative was launched in October 1996 on foot of the ESRI pensions survey, which indicated that fewer than half of workers have occupational pensions cover. The purpose of the initiative was to &ldquo;facilitate a national debate on how to work towards the development of the national pensions system.&rdquo; A pensions consultation document was published in February 1997 and 140 submissions were received.  A pensions forum was held in Dublin Castle in July 1997.  The report of the pensions board brings the initiative to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>We look forward to the recommendations of this report, which is very important in the overall context of planning for the future with regard to pensions.  Will the Minister assure the House that the Opposition parties, or at least the Opposition spokespersons, will have the opportunity to see the report rather than launching it with a fanfare of publicity like the employment action report, which was launched on a Sunday through the media?  That approach shows scant respect and possible discourtesy to Members.  I am sure the Minister will not act in that way and that he will provide an opportunity to Members to see the report.  It is an area in which I have an interest and would like to make a contribution before a spin is put on matters.  We should have an educated debate before formulating a response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 12 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I have today received the final report of the Commission on the Family, which is 700 pages in length.  It is my intention to bring the report to Government shortly, when I have read it, with a recommendation that it should be published.  I understand that due to the scope and nature of the issues involved, the finalisation of the report of the commission took somewhat longer than expected.</P>
      <P>Preliminary examination in my Department indicates the report contains a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of issues affecting families and wide-ranging recommendations across several different policy areas.  The recommendations have been put forward by the commission with the intention that they will provide the basis for the development of an integrated family policy to strengthen and assist families in coping with change and to put in place the supports to prevent family breakdown.  In addition, the commission has undertaken some original and significant research work which will be of benefit to analysts and policy makers, including a national survey of the child care arrangements which families make, sociological research on fathers and their role in family life and an overview of family policy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission brought forward some aspects of the final report for consideration in the context of the preparation of the 1998 budget.  I was delighted to be able to respond to the commission's recommendations.  The Government <Col N="484" /> provided significant allocations in the budget for the development of family services in my Department in 1998, including £700,000 for a network of family and community services resource centres &mdash; 25 or so new centres are to be put in place in 1998 in addition to the existing ten; an extra £600,000 for marriage counselling services bringing the total provision in 1998 to £1.5 million; and an extra £600,000 for the family mediation service for the establishment of additional centres towards the development of a national service, as we undertook to provide in our programme for Government.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have set up a new family affairs unit in my Department to promote the co-ordination of family policy, pursue the findings in the commission's final report following their consideration by the Government and to undertake research and promote awareness about family issues.  An allocation of somewhere in the region of £850,000 was made available to me in the budget to set up this unit and, given the size of the report, I will need the unit.  It will have responsibility for a number of family services including support for the marriage and child counselling services, the family mediation service, a pilot programme in relation to the local offices of my Department, building on the one-stop-shop concept with the aim of providing improved support at local level to families, and an information programme on parenting issues.  Following consideration by the Government, the report will be published as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am delighted to see this document, but I am glad that he rather than I will have to go through it.  I understood the report was to be published around Christmas.  I wondered about its delay, but given its size I understand the reason.  I was under the impression the commission was experiencing difficulty in deciding on key recommendations, but I am sure there are many recommendations in the report.  Many of the submissions to the commission related to child care, which has become such an important issue especially when both parents have to work to pay the mortgage, and other issues to which I referred earlier.  I wish the Minister luck in dealing with the report which I hope will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I also extend best wishes to the Minister on this matter, but I wish to put a suggestion to him.  He read two pages of a reply to a simple question about when the report will be published.  Will he consider changing the format of his replies and answer the question he is asked and no more?  There seems to be some anxiety, particularly in his Department, to ensure reams of paragraphs are provided for the Minister to reply to every simple question and consequently we are wasting a good deal of our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="485" /> From now on the Minister should focus on the questions he is asked.  He has responsibility for the answers.  He should indicate to those faithful and willing civil servants that he does not expect them to fill up two pages of rubbish when asked a simple question.  The same practice should apply to all the questions he is asked.  In that way we would get through business a lot quicker.</P>

In practice, however, it is rare for medical certifiers to be present at such examinations.</P>
      <P>Requests are sometimes made for the attendance of another person at a medical examination, for example, a relative of the person being examined.

It is seldom that a medical certifier is present at a patient's medical examination.  There is a good deal of confusion about whether elderly people are entitled to bring a relative with them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 10, 37 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for unemployment benefit or assistance a person must be unemployed, capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  In order to show that he or she satisfies these conditions an unemployed person must demonstrate that he or she is making genuine efforts to secure employment.</P>
      <P>At present, any person who refuses an offer of suitable employment or training will have his or her unemployment claim reviewed.  There is provision, under social welfare legislation, to disqualify a person for receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance for a period of up to nine weeks where it has been determined by a deciding officer that he or she has refused an offer of suitable employment; or refused or failed to avail of any reasonable opportunity of receiving suitable training provided or approved by FÁS; or failed or neglected to avail himself or herself of any reasonable opportunity of obtaining suitable employment.  In addition, the legislation provides for a disqualification for the receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance where a person is regarded as not being available for or genuinely seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="487" /> I will shortly be bringing into effect new regulations on the conditions requiring those on the live register to be available for and genuinely seeking work.  Those regulations will consolidate and clarify existing practices and procedures. They are intended to help ensure a more consistent and uniform application of the rules governing the deciding of unemployment benefit and assistance claims.  The new regulations will be accompanied by guidelines which will inform and assist my Department's deciding officers.  These guidelines will be published by my Department in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  Regarding debate on those regulations, I have written to the chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs requesting an opportunity to discuss the new regulations with members of the joint committee when they are published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is particularly interesting in light of his reply to my earlier question. Deputy Gormley tabled this question because the Tánaiste indicated quite bluntly that unemployment assistance may be withdrawn from anyone who refuses an offer of work or training under the Employment Action Plan discussed previously.  Will the Minister stick to what he said in this reply, given that in his reply to my earlier question he referred to allaying fears when I suggested this is what will happen?  Who decides what is suitable employment when it come to a person who cannot take up a position?  Where does this leave those involved in voluntary work which is socially valuable but unrecognised apart from their social welfare payment?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Who decides the suitability of employment?  What will happen to all the voluntary work done if doing such work will prevent somebody taking up a position?  Where do parents working in the home fit into the plan?  They are also unrecognised and often depend on welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations will not make it more difficult for people to qualify.  They will benefit everybody, including deciding officers and officials in the Department, and ensure there is uniform adherence to the practice which has built up over the years.  There will be no difference in the qualifying criteria which state that a person must be unemployed, capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  That has always been the case.  As the Deputy is aware, social welfare legislation provides that a person may be disqualified if the deciding officer is not satisfied. The officer can then take action accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the issue of determining whether a person is available for suitable full-time employment, the deciding officer must take into account <Col N="488" /> the person's skills, qualifications and experience, the length of time the person has been unemployed and the availability of job opportunities in the locality.  Ultimately, the deciding officer and the officials must base their decision on the reasonable steps a person has taken to secure employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will accept this matter involves subjective judgments.  As a consequence there are grey areas in terms of what may be considered reasonable or suitable.  I note the Minister had discussions with interest groups about the new regulations.  The guidelines will be important and perhaps the Minister could discuss a draft copy with the Committee on Social, Community and Family Affairs.  He may find to his surprise that most members of the committee have dealt with many social welfare matters and may have constructive proposals to make.  He should not bring along a finished product.  I accept he must then make the final decision. However, it would be sensible to avail of the expertise of the committee in advance of the production of new regulations.</P>

      <P>This issue of suitability for work is a grey area.  I am aware of a case where a hotel receptionist, who trained for three years, was out of work for a couple of months.  She was capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  There was a shortage of workers in the local food processing factory but she lost her unemployment benefit because she declined an offer of unsuitable work.  There are grey areas with regard to this matter.  Some people work in seasonal industries and they are offered other work for which they are unsuitable. If they refuse to take up this work, they lose their unemployment benefit.  I hope this area can be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations are being put in place for that reason and to ensure there is as little ambiguity as possible.  A number of factors are taken into account in decisions on whether a person is genuinely seeking work.  These include <Col N="489" /> a person making oral or written applications for work to employers or persons who advertised job offers on behalf of an employer, looking for information on the availability of employment from employers, advertisements, employment agencies, etc, availing of reasonable training opportunities suitable to his or her case and acting on the advice of a job facilitator, a FÁS adviser or a placement agency such as the local employment service.  These are not unreasonable conditions in the payment of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister open to any changes, given that he hopes to sign the regulations on Friday?  He referred to people being available for work.  Does this mean they must be idle?  It appears the most obvious way to show one is available for work is to be idle.  Is that a good thing to encourage among the unemployed? A later question relates to the black economy but there are considerable opportunities for people to do useful work even if it is not paid employment. In terms of a person's skills, experience and length of time being unemployed, will the criteria take into account involvement in voluntary work? Will that aspect inform the decision?  This debate is a clear justification for the introduction of an unconditional guaranteed basic income payment over a phased period.  This would remove subjectivity in terms of what is appropriate work, what is considered paid employment and what is useful work.  These are matters people must decide for themselves and from which communities will ultimately benefit.</P>

Ultimately, a person must seek employment, which is, in effect, paid employment. That has always been the case and will be the case in future.  The regulations will put on paper what has been the practice over the years.</P>

      <Quest>the number of non-nationals in receipt of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, the circumstances in which they are allowed to claim; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of non-nationals currently in receipt of unemployment assistance from my Department is approximately 4,600, the vast majority of whom are nationals of other EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare legislation does not require a minimum period of residence in Ireland for a person to qualify for unemployment assistance.  The <Col N="490" /> entitlement of non-nationals to unemployment assistance thus falls to be determined in accordance with the same conditions as claims by Irish nationals.</P>
    <P>To qualify for unemployment assistance a person must be unemployed, capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work and must satisfy a means test.  Under the Treaty of Rome, citizens of member states are entitled to travel to other member states to seek employment.  As such, EU nationals are treated in the same way as Irish citizens in respect of applications for unemployment assistance.  Non-EU nationals are subject to restrictions regarding the right to reside and work in the State.  Where they apply for unemployment assistance, evidence must be produced that they are legally resident in the State and are free to accept employment here.  Where these conditions are fulfilled they are allowed to claim unemployment assistance subject to the usual conditions. Non-EU nationals who do not hold work permits cannot claim unemployment assistance because they are considered to be not available for work. In general, unless they have means of their own, their sole potential source of income from the State is supplementary welfare allowance, paid by health boards out of the Social Welfare Vote.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are 2,900 supplementary welfare allowance payments being made to non-nationals in respect of approximately 4,800 people.  Almost all of these are asylum seekers, the vast majority of whom are living in Dublin. Each health board administers the supplementary welfare allowance scheme under the general direction and control of the Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs.  SWA payments to asylum seekers and other non-nationals may continue as long as the claimant resides in Ireland and satisfies relevant qualification conditions. Payments may include all SWA elements, including basic payments, rent supplements, deposits to secure private rented accommodation and other elements such as exceptional need payments and back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>

      <P>I would like information on two issues.  I accept the Minister may not have this information in his brief, but does he know how many Irish people draw unemployment assistance in other EU states?  How many Irish people draw supplementary assistance or its equivalent in non-EU states?  It seems in the context of our diaspora, the huge number of people who emigrated from Ireland, the numbers claiming here are insignificant &mdash; a total of 7,500, of whom about 4,500 are from other EU states and, therefore, have a right of residence here, and only 3,000 from outside the European Union.  I suggest that those figures would be swamped by the equivalent outflow figures of Irish people within the EU and outside it.  What is the cost involved for the 4,500 people from other EU states, which I presume include Britain?  What is the cost of supplementary welfare for the 3,000 claimants from outside the European Union?</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who have been given refuge, work and welfare in other countries, in the context of racist attitudes and xenophobia towards the handful of people who come to this country, it would be important to have those figures.

I was a Deputy in the period 1987-9 and, for those who were not here at that time, it was very difficult to be a Deputy on this side of the House in those years. Tough decisions were, however, taken and we are now reaping the benefit of those decisions.  Perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe expects my Department to go to every country in the world to find out the figures in regard to our diaspora.

      <P>As part of its normal business my Department undertakes a wide range of reviews of its activities.  Such reviews are intended to ensure that the social welfare schemes continue to operate effectively and fulfil their objectives in the light of current needs.  These reviews also give rise to opportunities to rationalise and simplify the social welfare system.  Any consequential changes to the Social Welfare Acts are normally incorporated in the annual Social Welfare Bill which implements the budget improvements in social welfare.</P>
      <P>For example, in this year's Social Welfare Bill, which was recently passed into law, I took the opportunity to rectify a number of anomalies which had come to my attention.  These relate to the alignment of grants payable in respect of multiple births under the child benefit scheme so that all multiple births will receive a grant of £500 at birth and further grants of £500 at the age of four and 12 years and for the disregard of rental income in the means test for widow's and widower's non-contributory pension on the same lines as provided for old age non-contributory pension.  Obviously I will continue to look for anomalies and blackspots in the future.</P>

      <P>When reference is made to doing little or nothing in regard to the social welfare code the Minister is only a few months in office, but in terms of claiming credit for the booming economy he is waving the flag very high. Will the Minister give a list of the anomalies and the cost of correcting them?  There is a sense of injustice on the part of people who may receive little under the social welfare code and who see their neighbour getting more.  Will the Minister agree such anomalies should be eliminated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the three separate rates of the child dependence allowance, it seems ridiculous that one child should be valued more than another.  The need is the same in all cases.  Does the Minister see merit in producing a list of the anomalies and <Col N="493" /> the costs, which we must all confront?  We are not talking about people who have contributed to a fund from which the cost should come but about making an extra budgetary commitment.  Does the Minister see merit in a list, which we could debate?</P>

      <P>When one moves the goalposts to try to cure a problem, which one tends to do from time to time in this job, one invariably comes up against another problem.  For example, I wished to fulfil a commitment we gave in the Programme for Government in relation to twins. When I set out what I wanted to achieve in terms of grants for twins, I found I was, in effect, discriminating against those who had triplets.  I had to make an adjustment in that respect in the budget at a further cost.  It would not be possible to list all the anomalies because one would invariably leave out examples.  There are hundreds of thousands of situations in which we believe there are anomalies.  I accept one could hone them down to perhaps self-employed pensions and other issues which arise from time to time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he has not set aside the good information he obtained as a mere Deputy. It is important to identify anomalies and the costs involved and raise them at the Committee on Family, Community and Social Affairs.  There are anomalies which are not sustainable and cannot be resolved because of regulations.  For example, if somebody is working part-time, in receipt of a certain amount of unemployment assistance and FIS and receives an income which could be declared as means, it is counted twice as means &mdash; when they are being assessed for unemployment assistance and again for the family income supplement. That is not reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must bear in mind we are talking about people on the margins &mdash; those on low incomes. A change of £10 per week in their income is important.

      <P>It was announced in the budget that all old age pensioners would get an increase of £5.  There is an anomaly in that many of them are not getting that increase because part of their income comes from social welfare in the UK or elsewhere.  For example, a person getting £30 per week from the UK and £45 here is only getting a £3 increase.  Will the Minister look at this matter because some people are disappointed?  The number involved is not too great and it would not cost too much money.  I understand a person who receives a certain amount from the UK, which does not constitute a full pension here, is paid on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Experience in Ireland and internationally shows that it is difficult to estimate the value of activity in the black economy.  Of its nature, this activity is designed to be hidden from the authorities, so that measuring it is subject to many difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Typically, the black economy is taken to include activities such as non-declaration of income or off the books business to evade taxation or other statutory liabilities, or claiming social welfare benefits while working.  A range of <Col N="495" /> activities is in place in my Department aimed at preventing and deterring such activity and detecting it where it occurs.  These activities include regular checks on the entitlements of persons receiving payments and inspections of employers and their records to ensure that they are meeting their obligations under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Some 600 staff are engaged full-time on anti-fraud and abuse measures, a key element of which is a programme of employer inspections being carried out each year, with some 8,000 employers visited in 1997.  As part of this inspection programme, inspectors from my Department form part of a nationwide joint inspection unit with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners. This unit uses the combined legal powers and expertise of both organisations to tackle abuses in both the social welfare and tax systems.</P>
    <P>Employer inspections undertaken by my Department comprise a number of tasks such as detailed examination of employers' records to ensure that accurate records of employees are being maintained and that correct PRSI payments are being made by employers in respect of all their employees; checks to ensure that employees are not concurrently working and claiming social welfare payments; checks to ensure that the correct class of PRSI is being deducted; outlining employers' responsibilities with regard to social welfare legislation and, where Revenue staff are part of the inspection team, tax legislation and giving advice and information to employers on matters such as the operation of the PRSI system, incentives available to employers, employees' entitlements and the correct classes of contributions.</P>
    <P>All cases of fraud by individuals or failure by employers to comply with their legal obligations are considered for criminal proceedings.  In 1997, a total of 245 cases, of which 61 referred to employers, were sent to the Chief State Solicitor's Office for prosecution.  The penalties available to the courts in respect of those convicted range to fines of £10,000 and-or three years in prison.  During the year 112 persons were convicted by the courts, of which 39 were employers.</P>
    <P>I am aware from discussions and correspondence with employer and union interests of concerns that, in some industries, workers insurably employed under contract of service are required to revert to self-employment type arrangements, known as the C45 system, to secure or remain in employment and my Department is in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to taking additional measures to ensure that employers fully comply with their legal obligations in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am also conscious of the fact that many employers have expressed concern in relation to difficulties they experience in filling vacancies.  A special effort to match workers to vacancies in the construction industry is being undertaken by my <Col N="496" /> Department, FÁS and the Construction Industry Federation, and I compliment them on that.</P>
    <P>My Department is also represented on the black economy monitoring group which also involves the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, the Small Firms Association and the Construction Industry Federation. The objectives of this group, which was set up in 1988, are to monitor developments in the black economy and to review the effectiveness of measures taken to combat tax and social welfare fraud.  I am keeping the effectiveness of anti-fraud and anti-abuse measures under review and whatever changes or additional measures that are appropriate in the light of experience will be made.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. I realise it is not possible to be categorical about this area but given that the Minister cannot give us even an estimated figure on the value of the black economy, will he accept that the Celtic tiger phase of the Irish economy has been assisted in some way by the continuation of a black economy given that GDP and GNP does not discriminate between honest and dishonest money &mdash; the spending of the money is what is being measured? Will the Minister accept that we may have to sacrifice some of the benefits of that phenomenon and redouble our efforts to end the abuse by employers, and indeed the self-employed, in the various sectors because the shortfall of tax revenue is starving State-supported services? Regardless of the &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo; among gardaí on Friday, the criminal activity of tax evasion will continue. What plans does the Minister have to redouble those efforts given that those to date do not deal adequately with the problem?</P>

      <P>I do not accept that current efforts do not deal adequately with the problem. By its nature the problem of the black economy is difficult to address.  As I said earlier, 600 people in my Department are employed full-time to ensure taxpayers' money under the social welfare code goes to the people who deserve it.  The total staff of 4,100 in the Department, who are employed to deal with the 800,000 people who come in contact with the Department on a daily and weekly basis, also have a duty to ensure that the money being spent on behalf of taxpayers is going to the right people.  When I went into the Department one of the first areas I examined was control of spending.  I thought I could bring some wisdom to the Department but I found that the Department is keenly aware of its responsibilities and has a comprehensive mechanism to ensure, as best as is possible within the restrictions of the law, that taxpayers' money is wisely spent.</P>

Will the Minister accept if that is the case &mdash; I do not know but I have reason to believe the number is significant &mdash; the loss to the Exchequer from the point of view of the payment of social welfare, the loss of PRSI and income tax could be in the order of £300 million per year?  Will the Minister accept that further action is urgently needed to deal with this problem?</P>
      <P>Evidence has come to light lately of young workers seeking employment being told they cannot be employees but were presented with a scheme which involved setting up a company which would then employ them.  That company would then be established as an independent contractor to the employer.  Will the Minister accept that, apart from loss of revenue to the Exchequer, this method does not provide fair protection to young workers?  Will he undertake to investigate this practice which could develop around the country?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this wide-ranging legislation which provides protection to many people who have suffered years of discrimination. Much of the discrimination has been experienced at a personal level, has caused great suffering and has had enormous consequences for those involved personally, financially and socially.  It is important that our law sets out clear standards and sends direct messages about our attitude to discrimination.  However, enshrining legislation in law is only a first step.  It is important that we have the necessary resources to ensure this legislation becomes reality.</P>
      <P>This legislation is also about changing attitudes. If we are to ensure that we have a society in which people can reach their full potential, irrespective of sex, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race or membership of the travelling community, much more work has to be done.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction but it must be publicised and fully explained.  I notice that in its submission the free legal advice centre in Coolock referred to the complexity of the language and the need to move to more simple language in our legislation generally.  In the absence of that, we must embark on a good public information campaign and I ask the Minister to respond to that suggestion.  The provisions of the Bill should be widely publicised and the necessary resources must be given to groups which can best run that public information campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise, an expanded equality authority will be unable to do its job without a serious assessment of the necessary resources.  I am speaking of both additional staff and an additional budget.  If <Col N="499" /> we are to be vigorous in promoting the objectives of the Bill, we must examine the issue of resources which has been a problem in this area. We are coming from a rather low base in trying to provide funding to tackle equality issues. Sometimes we think fairly small increases stretch further than they do, and it is easy to underestimate what is needed.</P>
    <P>This Bill also looks at issues of racism.  One could not address this Bill without expressing unease about the numbers of asylum seekers awaiting interviews.  We have 5,000 people who have been waiting a long time &mdash; hardly any interviews have been held since December.  If we want to ensure these people are not subject to discrimination and attack, as they have been, the very least we can do is deal speedily with their unique situation when they come into this country.  We need an information campaign.  The lack of a proactive approach by the Government in highlighting the needs of asylum seekers has been striking.  When we think about how Irish emigrants were welcomed in other countries over the years, we need to pay something back.  Of the world's 15 million refugees Europe receives only about 5 per cent compared to 90 per cent hosted by developing countries.  Sometimes we see this problem totally out of perspective, and we have recently seen a series of very racist headlines.</P>
    <P>One of the key issues is the level of protection from discrimination for those who are disabled. The Minister is obviously trying to walk a line between staying within what the Supreme Court judgment says and protecting the disabled.  There is need for a higher level of protection than that provided for in the Bill.  I hope that before the end of the debate the Minister of State will have got the legal advice that will enable her to go further with this provision.  There is no need to wait for a disabilities Bill.  We could be a little bit more courageous in this one.  The protection is too restricted &mdash; there is less protection for the disabled here than for the other eight categories and we should try to remedy that now.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this.</P>
    <P>Huge numbers of people with disabilities are capable of working as effectively as non-disabled people but require small infrastructural adjustments such as ramps and special computer equipment. It could easily be argued that the cost of implementation is more than nominal.  If we accept the Bill as currently drafted we are talking about nominal or token protection, and that is not enough.  The Minister has submissions from a very wide variety of groups, from the Irish Council for People with Disabilities and many others. It is stated that the Bill could establish a hierarchy of people with various disabilities and that the replacement of reasonable accommodation at nominal cost could prove to be an open licence for employers to discriminate against people with disability, and there is a scandalous level of unemployment among people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> The Bill does not define &ldquo;nominal cost&rdquo;.  It is a concept that is very vague and potentially very limiting.  It is quite worrying that we have not addressed it in more detail.  At what threshold, for example, does a cost become other than nominal? Employers should not be allowed the benefit of the let-out unless they first ascertain what is reasonably available from the State.  The nominal cost could be computed taking into account what is available from the State on the facts of any given case.  There are some worries about section 35 in relation to subsidy from the State.  Perhaps the Minister would look at that too.</P>
    <P>This Bill includes people with disabilities in equality legislation for the first time, and that is welcome.  However, we should not sell them short.  It is necessary for the Minister of State to obtain legal advice to see if she can go further than she has while taking account of the Supreme Court judgment.  We are out of step with best international practice, and there is no reason we should be so.  I hope the Minister will introduce an amendment on this before the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides for equal pay.  However, the whole question of access to work is still problematic for many women, given our live register requirements.  This is an issue that must be addressed in the context of equal pay.  Women still tend to predominate in certain sectors, often less well paid and without proper opportunities for training or upward progression.  Women are concentrated mainly in three sectors, services, clerical and a narrow range of professions. Women also predominate in low paid areas and as atypical employees.  We have to talk about women not as a whole group but in the context of issues relevant to different sectors.  The question of child care, which I have already addressed, has to be taken on board if equal pay is to become a reality.  We really must wake up to providing high quality, accessible and affordable child care.  This must be seen as a positive enhancement in the lives of children and parents and not as an optional extra.  Parental leave must be introduced, and flexibility in the workplace for carers of children and the elderly.</P>
    <P>This Bill also deals with sexual harassment. There is some very disturbing research which the Employment Equality Agency has done in relation to sexual harassment.  Recent research showed, for example, that 18 per cent of women and 2 per cent of men in a large unionised organisation had experienced sexual harassment during their career, 60 per cent of which had occurred in the previous 18 months.  A staggering 79 per cent of people who witness the harassment choose not to get involved.  We all know that from our own experience.  It is clear that physical harassment is not now tolerated by employees, with rare exceptions, but it is clear that supports are lacking to help people raise grievances concerning the more subtle forms of harassment, and I welcome the definition in section 23.  An information programme is necessary on this question because, as the research I have quoted clearly illustrates, <Col N="501" /> there is a problem in relation to this issue in the workplace.  Section 23 does not deal with same sex harassment.  This is something the Minister should look at.  There is no reason whatsoever to exclude this from the definitions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another disturbing issue is that there is an increasing number of calls to the Employment Equality Agency concerning the failure to accommodate pregnancy at work.  This is very worrying and points to the fact that we have to work incredibly hard on attitudes.  I have heard from a number of women recently of subtle and not so subtle forms of discrimination against them if they are pregnant.  It shows that old attitudes die hard and that we need to be vigilant.  If we are serious about combining work and family life, if we are serious about gender equity, this is a very big issue.  One would have hoped attitudes had gone beyond this but sadly they have not. However, I welcome the huge efforts being made by many employers and social partners to deal with the question of harassment and promote gender equality in a variety of ways.  Much can be learned from the gender experience by those other groups who are now covered under this Bill and protected from discrimination.</P>
    <P>What we are discussing here is intimately linked with equal opportunities in education. Obviously we need an ongoing programme in equal opportunities in education.  The more one examines this Bill, the more one recognises that it requires actions by a very wide range of Departments and by a wide range of social partners for it to be effective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the support for positive action under sections 39 and 63.  This positive approach, as outlined in the equality review and action plan section, is excellent.  It is the way forward.  I hope it means that many businesses will be supported and encouraged in carrying out equality reviews. It is in very sharp contrast to section 88.  I would like some more information on that section.  It allows for research and inspection.  I do not think this is the way we really want to go in terms of equality legislation, but perhaps there is some reason this is included.  This seems to be very strong legislation.  I do not know whether it is a separate new power we are taking on, but I would like to hear from the Minister before Committee Stage what exactly is envisaged here and why it is felt necessary to put in such strong powers.</P>
    <P>I also note the special provisions for the Defence Forces in a number of sections.  I question the exclusion of the Defence Forces from the mechanisms which other people can use. Obviously the Defence Forces are changing dramatically and the question of the individual human rights of members of the Defence Forces is something we ought to consider rather than going for blanket exclusions.  Why not give rights of redress to members of the Defence Forces? There are also some exclusions in relation to the Defence Forces which I do not think necessary.</P>
    <P>I know the intent of section 16(4) is to provide protection for children.  However, I suggest that <Col N="502" /> if one wishes to screen out unsafe staff, a range of good work practices in the workplace must be developed.  Some rewording of the section may be necessary to ensure it does not unfairly lead to discrimination against individuals.  This is obviously a very delicate area as it is necessary to be careful in screening out unsuitable staff.  References must be obtained and good practices must be in place.  The phrase &ldquo;reliable information&rdquo; is too broad and could lead to unjustified discrimination. Some minor changes in wording would give the protection sought for children in the employment of staff while, at the same time, not being unduly discriminatory towards certain people.  This area must be examined.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of discussion about section 37(1) before the Bill was referred to the Supreme Court.  It is obviously not a complete and total code on dismissals.  There are worries that it could be used inappropriately and unreasonably to discriminate against teachers.  It could be unfairly and arbitrarily decided that their behaviour is against the ethos of the institution. It could also be argued that this section builds in a procedure whereby unfair recruitment can be challenged.  I am uncertain in my attitude to it as currently framed.  One question I would raise is whether sexual orientation can be used as a ground not to employ someone under this section.  I am unclear on that and I would like it clarified, if possible.</P>
    <P>Section 37(6) defines disability and impairment very widely; it is very inclusive and wide-ranging. It is very wide-ranging in terms of the number of persons employed who would be excluded under the provisions.  The exclusion may be disproportionate to the intended aims of treating people equally without regard to the various grounds of difference.  Section 37 states that persons can be excluded from employment in a service on the grounds of slight disability or perceptible impairments. I do not believe those would interfere with their capacity to carry out a job.  That section could be changed slightly and would be less discriminatory for that.</P>
    <P>The form of redress outlined in the Bill is a very complex mechanism.  Depending on the grounds upon which a case is taken, whether they are general grounds, dismissal, gender or discrimination by the Civil Service, different fora must be appealed to.  It is necessary to go to the director of equality investigations, the Labour Court, the Circuit Court or a number of others. It is very complex and I am unsure how easy it is to solve this issue, but I ask that it be addressed. The issue of legal aid being unavailable in employment cases needs consideration.  We assume the unions and the Employment Equality Agency will tackle this but perhaps we ought to extend legal aid to cover these cases.</P>
    <P>This is welcome legislation.  It is timely as we enter the new millennium that we enshrine in legislation protection to ensure people are not discriminated against.  However, it does need back-up resources and information campaigns to <Col N="503" /> ensure the provisions are widely known and implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has been reintroduced in the Oireachtas without undue delay following the Supreme Court judgment which found parts of it to be unconstitutional. However, I am not convinced the best possible wording has been used in the Bill to safeguard the rights of people with disabilities and to allow them be accommodated in the workplace. We are certainly constrained by the judgment of the court, but it was unnecessary to water down the original version to this extent.  I commend the work done in the Seanad on the Bill.  I know a considerable amount of time was spent discussing it, especially on Committee Stage.  I also know my colleague, Senator O'Meara, put in a great deal of work in that regard and I commend the Seanad for the work it did.  However, there is still much room for improvement in the Bill, especially in relation to the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Employment equality and equal status legislation are cornerstones of an inclusive society.  I have no doubt that the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform by the previous Government was critical in the formulation of these Bills.  I pay tribute to the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, who is now in retirement and enjoying it very much, for the commitment with which he pioneered legislation designed to reinforce human rights and tolerance in society.  That Department has been subsumed into the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, but we will be watching to ensure these aspects of the Department are not sidelined and will continue to be given priority in this House.  It is also significant that the Good Friday Agreement for Northern Ireland contains a specific commitment to introduce employment equality and equal status legislation in the Republic parallel to a series of human rights commitments north of the Border.  This is an indication of how central such legislation is to a fair and inclusive society.</P>
      <P>I find it disturbing that a Bill designed to improve the position of minorities in the employment market should be found to clash with the Constitution.  Serious consideration should be given to changing the Constitution if we can find no better safeguard than the wording in the Bill. The Minister's interpretation of the protection of private property afforded by the Constitution means that only nominal costs can be put upon the employer to facilitate a disabled worker.  I do not believe the Minister is so constrained by the Constitution as to be obliged to use such a mealy-mouthed adjective as &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;.  The Irish Council for People with Disabilities has proposed a more forthright wording to which I hope the Minister will give consideration as the Bill progresses through Committee and Report Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked up the definition of &ldquo;nominal&rdquo; in the dictionary and found a variety of definitions.  It can mean &ldquo;token&rdquo;, &ldquo;small&rdquo;, &ldquo;minimal in comparison <Col N="504" /> with real worth or what is expected&rdquo; or &ldquo;in name only&rdquo;.  In effect, employers are not required to take even pence from their profits to facilitate a disabled worker.  That is not good enough, especially in an economy where, despite prosperity, it is estimated that as much as 80 per cent of people with a disability are unemployed. If this is the best wording which can be produced, then the balance between social justice and the constitutional property rights is totally skewed on the side of property.  If the Minister is really that constrained, we should acknowledge that the Constitution is not an adequate framework on which to construct the kind of society we want for the 21st century and we should propose to the people of Ireland that it be amended.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the proposals from the Constitution Review Group should also be heeded.  It has made proposals in this regard as well.  Our Government was to the forefront in negotiating non-discriminatory clauses in the Amsterdam Treaty which will be given great consideration soon.  If the wording cannot be improved, we should seriously consider changing the Constitution or at least putting proposed changes to it to the people of Ireland.  I look forward to further Stages and hope there will be a possibility of improving the wording in relation to the rights of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill are not adequate as regards people with disabilities.  I cite section 35 in particular which needs to be linked to the equal pay sections of the Bill to ensure there are no loopholes with regard to a disabled person's right to having equal pay for equal work.  The equal pay section is linked to sections covering other people but not specifically to section 35 which deals largely with people with disabilities. I ask the Minister to examine that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the National Economic and Social Forum that the State should bear the cost of adaptations in the workplace.  However, there is already a workplace adaptation grant available to employers with a maximum level of £5,000. Experience in the US, where there is enlightened employment legislation concerning people with disabilities, shows that, in many cases, no cost is incurred by the employer.  In 70 per cent of cases, the cost was less than $500 and was over $5,000 in less than 5 per cent of cases.  This indicates that the grant already available to employers could cover the cost incurred in employing people with disabilities.  Many new employers in our economy are American multinationals who would obviously be very familiar with the operations of disability legislation in the US.  They should not have any great problems, therefore, with stringent and enlightened legislation in this area.</P>
    <P>The legislation should be amended to take account of the workplace adaptation grant and other grants available to employers.  I agree with the view of the National Economic and Social Forum that a portion of the employment levy could be assigned to top up the funds already <Col N="505" /> available for such grants.  When a workplace is adapted to suit a woman or a disabled worker, it inevitably facilitates other women or disabled workers.  While the changes may be made to suit only one person, they will inevitably assist others, including the public who may enter the building for business reasons and so on.  This building was adapted to suit Brian Crowley's needs when he became a Senator, but the changes subsequently benefited members of the public.  There are many examples of adaptations which have had a broader and wider effect than the purposes for which they were originally intended.</P>
    <P>The grossly high level of unemployment among people with a disability &mdash; approximately 18 per cent &mdash; needs to be addressed in a holistic manner. The provision of personal assistants could be the most effective enabler for many people.  The argument made by the National Training and Development Institute that vocational training for people with disabilities should be transferred from the Department of Health and Science to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should receive a positive response. This would be a positive change of mindset and identify people with disabilities as a resource rather than a cost to the economy.  The groups that represent people with disabilities feel strongly that they should be seen as a positive resource to the community.  If that mindset is changed, other changes will follow.  The phrase &ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo; is often used in relation to Northern Ireland.  We should give all out citizens the same level of esteem.  The Bill refers specifically to vocational training.</P>
    <P>The nine grounds on which discrimination is outlawed in the legislation are comprehensive and proactive in promoting tolerance and respect for diversity.  There is disturbing evidence that the potential for racist sentiment is not far below the surface.  Most citizens empathise with the stranger in a strange land, but there is evidence of a selfishness that does not want to share.  The Bill will help to combat racism.  In the recent past there has been a steady stream of immigrants into the country.  These people fall into many categories, including students, fellow EU citizens, asylum seekers and non-EU citizens who have qualified for work permits.  In some instances society has not reacted well to this immigration and one can easily detect the emergence of sentiments that have fuelled the growth of the National Front in France and other far right groups across Europe.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the legislation will become one of the State's most effective tools in combating this nascent racism.  As a country that has a long history of emigration, we should be to the forefront in the campaign against prejudice and intolerance. We need only look at the experience of our previous generations of emigrants to know how soul destroying intolerance and exclusion can be.  The ignorance, and in many cases brutality, visited on so many Irish emigrants is known to every Member.  The effect this attitude has on a young emigrant, often homesick and unsure of <Col N="506" /> his or her place in a new city, can be devastating and lead to isolation, poverty, alcohol and drug abuse and, at its most extreme, wasted lives.</P>
    <P>It behoves us as a people who have been on the receiving end of racism for much of our history to ensure this evil does not gain a foothold in our society.  I am not suggesting that we do not have to address serious questions regarding multiculturalism, but we should address these issues as quickly and as comprehensively as possible and not repeat the appalling mistakes of other EU States in the past.  I am confident that, if effectively implemented, the legislation will form part of that process and I urge the Minister to continue the progress achieved by this Bill in other legislation and policy initiatives.</P>
    <P>The protection given to the travelling community is also of real worth.  In this context, will the Minister ensure the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Travelling People are being implemented?</P>
    <P>Despite the major error regarding disability rights in the Bill, the Employment Equality Bill is genuinely reforming legislation.  The Labour Party has campaigned for the legislation for many years.  It has been sought by many interest groups comprising, and working to advance the status of, the marginalised in our society.  In particular I am pleased the legislation outlaws discrimination on grounds of age.  Males over 45 are hardest hit by long-term unemployment.  Many factors, including education and technical skills among that group, contribute to this.  However, the age limits imposed by many employers, including the public service, are also a contributory factor to the stubbornly high level of unemployment among males over 45.  That many employers, including the State, give out the message that workers are &ldquo;over the hill&rdquo; once they reach middle age has a detrimental effect on those seeking work.  It also chips away at the motivation and energy needed by people searching for employment.  It takes a great deal of energy and motivation to go out day after day seeking employment when one is constantly turned down for a job.</P>
    <P>I am confident the new equality authority will bring about a cultural change in society in terms of the manner in which we treat middle-aged job seekers.  In the USA many employers have recognised the value of having experienced and mature people working in their firms.  This has lead to an influx of middle-aged workers into the retail and service sector which traditionally was dominated by students and young school leavers.  The service sector is a growth area in employment terms here and, therefore, should be seen as an opportunity to redress the balance in this regard.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of the Employment Equality Agency since it was set up in 1977.  Many equality issues for women in the workplace have been addressed.  From 1991-96 the number of women in the workplace almost doubled compared with the previous 20 years.  That is an indication of the progress that has been made in this area.  Women make up four-tenths of the workforce. <Col N="507" /> Child care and low pay need to be addressed.  Women still receive only 70 per cent of the average industrial wage for men.  We still have a long way to go in this regard.  While it is not easy to deal with the organisational culture in legislation, it is very difficult for women to break into certain areas of employment.</P>
    <P>In setting up the new equality authority, we need to take on board much of what has been achieved by its predecessor.  Its resourcing levels will be critical to ensuring this flawed but important legislation makes a real difference in our society.  The House has often passed excellent legislation that seeks to improve and enhance the lives of ordinary working people only to find its implementation is hamstrung by a lack of resources and a dearth of funding.  For example, the day to day effect of our health and safety legislation has been seriously undermined by the lack of resources allocated to the Health and Safety Authority.  It took the tragic death of a young man on a Dublin building site to bring public focus to the worryingly low number of inspectors who enforce our health and safety legislation.</P>
    <P>Passing legislation without adequately funding implementation structures is a useless exercise.  It is imperative that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past with the new employment equality agency.  I urge the Minister to ensure it is adequately funded and staffed.  It is also important that the Government embarks on a major information campaign when the legislation is passed.  Workers, employers and students must be made aware of their rights under the Bill in an accessible manner.  I am confident that the Minister will receive the support and co-operation of the trade union movement and other interested groups in disseminating this information as widely as possible.  However, the responsibility to plan, fund and initiate a campaign rests with the Minister.  I hope he will outline his proposals in this regard.  I welcome the fact that sexual harassment is included in the legislation but we also need an information campaign in this regard.</P>
    <P>As Labour Party spokesperson on equality and law reform I welcome the Government's stated intention to introduce a disabilities Bill.  The Taoiseach has stated that he will give information on when this Bill will be published.  However, I am concerned that the Government may be using the proposed disabilities Bill as a smokescreen for its failure in this Bill to tackle the issue of reasonable access and accommodation in the workplace for those with disabilities.  If there is a constitutional problem with tackling this issue in the Employment Equality Bill it follows that the same difficulty could apply to any future disabilities Bill.  Priority must be given to appropriately amending this Bill rather than waiting for a disabilities Bill to give proper protection in the workplace to those with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Where are the great amending initiatives proposed by Fianna Fáil to the original Bill?  In <Col N="508" /> Opposition Fianna Fáil tabled a raft of amendments to this legislation.  In October 1996, when Mervyn Taylor's Bill was in this House, Fianna Fáil members were adamant that their amendments should be accepted.  In an amendment, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe stated that it was &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; to omit Defence Forces personnel from the legislation.  In support of that amendment, Deputy Bertie Ahern stated: &ldquo;I hope we are enacting serious legislation, not mere words.  The Bill as it stands cannot be described as such&rdquo;. However the reforming zeal expressed in Opposition has evaporated in Government.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara tabled the same amendments when this Bill was debated in the Seanad but the Minister refused to accept any of his party's original proposals.  The inconsistency shown has to be addressed.  This inconsistency was also shown in the Protection of Shop Workers Bill.  It is not helpful when one thing is said in Opposition and another done in office.  That contributes to the cynicism about politics.  I was disappointed at the attitude taken to the original Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party fully supports the inclusion of workers employed through employment agencies under the ambit of the Bill.  The employment agency business has undergone phenomenal growth and now forms a significant method of recruiting employees.  Employment agencies often specialise in the provision of contract employment.  This system is often open to abuse by rogue employers.  It is right and proper that companies, particularly some multinational companies, should not be able to circumvent this legislation by not employing people directly. From my own experience I know that many companies are using this method and I am glad that the Bill has addressed that loophole.  It is important that the State treats all workers with the same respect.  I am glad to see that the Government has got this aspect of the Bill right.</P>
    <P>This legislation needs a comprehensive and ongoing information campaign.  If we are serious about eliminating discrimination from the workplace it is important that this campaign is taken on vigorously and that it is effective.  Knowledge is power and there is an obligation on Government to impart awareness of this legislation to the workforce.  This is particularly true for those returning to work or school leavers entering the workforce for the first time.  The pressure on both groups can often encourage them to be less than forceful about their rights and an employer's legal obligations.  However, it is often the case that these groups are the people who most need protection. There are steps the Minister must take to address this problem.  For instance, every FÁS trainee attending a course should be made aware of the new legislation and the avenues open if they feel their rights are being trampled on.  This should also apply to other labour legislation as there are many rights in this regard but few people are aware of these rights.</P>
    <P>Community employment workers as part of the training element of the scheme should also <Col N="509" /> receive information on the effects of this Bill. People placed through the local employment service must also know their rights and be given the support and confidence to have them upheld. Local employment services have a big part to play in relation to inclusion in the workforce and with regard to those people covered by this legislation having access to work.  Those who run these services should be proactive and be encouraged to reach out to the various categories who might be discriminated against and who are covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for having a basic module on employment law and employee rights incorporated into every State-sponsored training or back to work scheme.  I am constantly shocked at the low level of awareness of employee rights. This is often most prevalent in sectors where trade union membership is frowned upon and actively discouraged by employers.  This goes back to the &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo; dictum.  The State must take seriously its duties and obligations to provide this knowledge to workers, particularly to low paid, non-unionised workers who are often most vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.</P>
    <P>Apart from its inadequacies which are crucial for those with disabilities and which I hope will be addressed, this is a comprehensive reforming Bill.  It will give workers protection from discrimination and provide them with an accessible mechanism through which to pursue instances of discrimination. It sends out a strong message that this State insists that all persons are treated equally regardless of race, creed, marital status, sexual orientation etc.  It is important that the State sends out such messages and that the philosophy of equality and fairness which underpins this legislation should pervade all aspects of Government activity and policy.  If we enact this and other legislation such as the Equal Status Bill and the disabilities Bill we can hope that the social attitudes which cannot be legislated for will follow and that we will have a genuinely inclusive society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this comprehensive Bill. The nature of work is changing radically and will have huge consequences for tomorrow's working environment.  It is encouraging to see the Minister and his Department recognising this reality and being proactive in using this transitional period to implement policies which seek to eliminate prejudices which may exist in the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discrimination must be eliminated from all aspects of employment and this Bill is an important step in that process.  I also compliment the Minister on seeking to be at the forefront of modern employment equality codes in Europe. The importance of this issue is evident from the priority given to it since he took office.  He has produced a comprehensive Bill which addresses the issue constructively and fairly.  It lays a solid foundation for other proactive measures which will follow with the common aim of eliminating <Col N="510" /> inequality, not just in employment but in a wider context.</P>
    <P>This Bill stems from the 1996 Bill, provisions of which were found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  The Minister must be commended on the redrafting of three issues which allows their retention within the scope of the Bill, particularly the provision of reasonable accommodation for those with disabilities.  Section 35 requires an employer to make special provision for a person with a disability provided that such provision would not give rise to a cost, other than a nominal cost, to the employer.  His willingness to examine the option of more specific disabilities legislation is welcome and highlights the importance he places on this area.  Certain representative groups have reservations about aspects of the Bill in so far as they relate to people with disabilities.  Those groups recognise that the provisions as they relate to people with disabilities, represent an important step towards ensuring that people with disabilities in future will be able to exercise their right to participate in work on an equal basis with other employees.</P>
    <P>Research shows that households headed by people who are unable to work due to illness or disability are more likely to encounter poverty and experience deprivation.  The level of unemployment among people with disabilities estimated at 80 per cent is unacceptable.  The reasons are varied.  The provisions relating to people with disabilities should help them participate in the labour market on an equal basis and reduce this figure not alone by offering protection to those affected but also by heightening awareness among employers of the value of those workers to their businesses.  The Bill aims to eliminate all forms of discrimination, not only against people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the grounds on which discrimination is to be prohibited.  They are marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, membership of the traveller community and gender.  Unfortunately, discrimination on grounds of gender still exists.  The participation of and contribution of women in the workforce has increased dramatically since the Employment Equality Act, 1977, which presented new employment opportunities to women.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to believe that only a relatively short time ago society took it for granted that women would occupy the lowest rung of the career ladder in most places of work and would retire on marriage or when the first child was born and devote the rest of their lives to home duties.  There was a general expectation at the time, with some notable exceptions, that successful businesses would be run by men, banks were managed by men, corporate boards were chaired by men, Government Departments were administered by men and even a place at the Cabinet table was restricted to men.  All that has changed. It is now accepted that a woman may choose any of the professions and, should she aspire to it, <Col N="511" /> work to secure a top job in business, in the boardroom or in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The Bill has the potential to radically change the structure of the workforce as did its predecessor in 1977.  While the 1977 Act was a huge success in boosting the number of women participating in the workplace, its success has not extended to providing the framework for women to achieve positions at the higher levels in the organisations in which they are employed.  This Bill proposes to help redress the imbalance so that a woman can realistically aspire to secure a senior position wherever she chooses to work.</P>
    <P>The new equality authority is a powerful tool which will enable progress towards equality and remove existing inequalities which affect women's progression in the workplace.  Due to the shift of employment towards high-tech sectors there is a risk, given the rapid rate of change associated with the sector, that the skills of many of today's workers will quickly become redundant. This risk is greater among older workers and discrimination on age grounds should not be allowed to continue.  There is a recognition across Europe that these workers represent a highly skilled source of labour and are by no means expendable.  Enterprises must recognise the skills of capable and flexible workers and not disregard the skills of some workers because of traditional prejudices or outdated concepts of human resource management.  To do so would lead to a reduction in our economic success and increase marginalisation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is only the beginning of a wider initiative to create a more equal society and eliminate discrimination.  Ireland's success owes much to well educated, flexible, reliable employees in a dynamic environment.  Employment legislation must be dynamic to adapt to such an environment but equality must not be sacrificed in the name of success.  The Bill should ensure Ireland has an all-inclusive, all-encompassing workforce as we face future challenges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The stated purpose of the Employment Equality Bill is to end discrimination in employment on a number of grounds. It is inevitable that its second presentation will concentrate somewhat on discrimination on grounds of disability, the area on which the Supreme Court struck down the original Bill.</P>
      <P>This second opportunity should help us to examine the Employment Equality Bill critically from the point of view of whether legislation is effective in dealing with discrimination in the workplace on different grounds, whether legislation is sufficient to deal with discrimination in the workplace and whether the Bill will be as effective as claimed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to examine the question of discrimination generally.  There are not many cases where one can point to direct overt discrimination in the workplace.  There are very few cases where an employer will pointedly and overtly refuse to <Col N="512" /> employ a woman or somebody on the grounds of discrimination prohibited in the Bill.  However, the area of employment history is well scattered with cases where discrimination is alive and well and is being practised in an indirect, insidious and subtle way.  The job is not refused and the promotion is not refused because one is a woman with a family and child responsibilities, but on some other grounds of suitability.</P>
    <P>I agree with the comments made and the tributes paid to the work of the Employment Equality Agency, since its establishment 20 years ago.  If we examine the two Acts which this Bill is replacing &mdash; the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 &mdash; there can be no doubt they have contributed enormously to greater equality in the workplace. The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act has certainly ended cases of unequal pay but it has not been successful in equalising the distribution of earnings as between men and women.  Similarly, the Employment Equality Act, has been helpful in addressing the question of discrimination in the workplace.  Similarly, the Employment Equality Act has been helpful in addressing discrimination in the workplace but we would have to reflect on how successful it and our employment practices have been in areas of indirect discrimination. Why are there still areas of employment with large numbers of women who have not managed to rise through the promotional process in significant numbers?  One would expect, 20 years after discrimination in the workplace became formally illegal, that greater numbers would have been promoted.  In the Civil Service there is only one female departmental Secretary-General; in local authorities, which employ huge numbers of women, there are no female county managers and only one female deputy county manager; there are no women chief executive officers of health boards or vocational education committees; and one must wonder why the number of female school principals is so disproportionate to the number of women teachers.</P>
    <P>Fundamental questions must be asked about the effectiveness of legislation in addressing indirect discrimination in the workplace, such as the various direct and indirect discouragements. There are certain requirements on employees in order to enter the promotion rat race and many women are unable or unwilling to engage in them.  Other discouragements are often placed in their way.  It might also be interesting to examine the cases where women have come through the system to promotional positions to see what proportion of them have family or child responsibilities, because there is discrimination not only against women <i>per se</i> but additionally against parents.</P>
    <P>One would expect this Bill to address those areas.  If it were to abolish discrimination in the workplace it would be welcome, and many of its provisions and the procedures which it establishes are good.  However, I am disappointed that it does not address discrimination where it occurs <Col N="513" />&mdash; in fact, it appears to address discrimination in the workplace everywhere except where it occurs and is difficult to shift.  For example, when this Bill is passed it will still be legal to discriminate against certain employees on grounds of age or religion, especially in schools and hospitals.  It will allow for discrimination against certain public service employees on grounds of citizenship, proficiency in the Irish language and residence.  It will continue the discrimination in the Garda Síochána on height grounds and on grounds of disability, as was mentioned.</P>
    <P>In some respects the Bill will make discrimination legal and thus make matters worse.  Up to now there has been ambiguity about whether an employer could discriminate and that operated as a discipline on employers but when legislation provides for specific exemptions discrimination is effectively made legal.  Instead of ending discrimination, some sections of this Bill may serve unwittingly to continue and promote it.  I do not suggest we should have a regime in which an employer is obliged to employ someone who is not suitable for a job, is not competent to carry it out or is not willing to comply with the conditions of employment, and section 16 makes clear that the anti-discrimination provisions do not apply where the employer exercises his or her normal right not to employ a person who is not qualified for a job or to discontinue the employment of a person who is not doing a job, not fulfilling the conditions or is not competent.  Given how clear that section is, I am at a loss to understand why the Bill is punctuated with additional exemptions which will leave the way open for discriminatory practice.</P>
    <P>To deal first with age discrimination, section 6 states that the Bill will not apply to anyone under 18 or over 65 years.  I do not question the under 18 provision but I question the over 65 provision. As Deputy Collins said, the world of work has changed dramatically, especially since the days when it was assumed that one's working life lasted from mid-twenties until the age of 65, usually in the same occupation and with the same employer, during which period one acquired pension entitlements.  That has all changed &mdash; many employees voluntarily leave the workforce by taking early retirement in their fifties but may wish to continue in employment over a longer period, perhaps at a reduced remuneration.  The golden rule that one must leave work at 65 is a thing of the past and should not be reflected in our legislation.  This provision is discriminatory.</P>
    <P>Similarly, section 34 contains a loophole which will allow discrimination on age grounds.  Section 34(3) states that nothing in this Part or Part II shall make discrimination on grounds of age or disability unlawful, if there is actuarial or other evidence that significantly increased costs would result if the discrimination were not permitted. Section 34(4) allows for the fixing of different ages for the retirement of employees or classes of employees and section 34(5) allows for the fixing of a maximum age of recruitment which takes account of the cost of training and pensions.  A <Col N="514" /> case can be made from an actuarial or pension viewpoint where someone is employed late in life but why should that prevent a person from being employed in the first place?</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the House previously that, right up to the second presentation of this Bill, some parts of the public service still used an age bar to recruitment &mdash; people over 50 could not apply for certain jobs.  Could the Minister state what consideration has been given in the public service to the age of recruitment?  Is it true that it is intended, following the enactment of this legislation, that people over the age of 55 could not be recruited to certain public sector jobs?  There is a need for clarification.  This loophole will be used to discriminate against people on grounds of age.  This issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Section 27 will allow the Garda Síochána to include a height requirement in recruitment. There is no justification for this and the opportunity should be taken to delete it rather than enshrine it in anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 36 contains a number of interesting provisions.  It deals with certain categories of jobs in the public service, including members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, officers or servants of a local authority, harbour authority, health board or vocational education committee and teachers in primary and post-primary schools.  Under the Bill employers of all these categories will be able to discriminate on grounds of residence.  Under the old rule vocational school teachers were required to live within three miles of the school.</P>
    <P>Employers will also be able to discriminate on grounds of citizenship.  Does this mean that if somebody from Northern Ireland decides, under the new Agreement, to exercise their right to UK citizenship and seek employment here as a social worker with a health board, they may be discriminated against on grounds that they do not hold Irish citizenship?  In the United States the only job a non citizen is not eligible to apply for is the Presidency.  In this State one has to be a citizen before one can apply for the post of teacher in a primary or post-primary school or officer or road sweeper in a local authority.</P>
    <P>Employers will further be able to discriminate on grounds of proficiency in the Irish language.  I understand this is necessary in the case of teachers and appreciate that people availing of public services should be able to conduct their business through Irish but, following the recent decision of the INTO congress, it is an issue that should be revisited.  I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, that it is no longer necessary for every public servant to have a smattering of half forgotten school Irish, that it is much more important to have somebody in the service who can conduct business through Irish in an efficient and effective way.</P>
    <P>The question of disability has been dealt with. I agree with previous speakers that the Minister of State should examine seriously the case made by the Irish Council for People with Disabilities <Col N="515" /> and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  We will have an opportunity to return to the relevant provisions on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 37 was the subject of much debate when initially considered.  It has been considerably improved.  Why is it necessary to include it in the legislation?  Although financed from the public purse, most hospitals and schools are denominational.  Section 37 will make it legal for employers in these hospitals and schools to discriminate on grounds of religion.  While it will be argued that this does not happen regularly and I am aware that the case was made in the debate on the original Bill that a school run by a minority religion somewhere in the south of the country was encountering difficulty in recruiting a co-religionist as an assistant teacher, we have to look at the wider picture.  It is far more likely that the problem of discrimination on grounds of religion will arise in the area of promotions, for example, when a nurse who has not been a candle carrying member of the church to the degree that satisfies her employers applies for the post of matron in a hospital or when a teacher applies for a senior position in a school when discreet inquiries will be made in their past parishes about their religious practice.  These are areas in which there is indirect discrimination.</P>
    <P>There is an additional ground which should be considered for inclusion, trade union membership. While I appreciate this issue is touched on in the legislation dealing with dismissal, having regard to some of our recent industrial relations experiences, the opportunity should be taken in this legislation to make discrimination on grounds of trade union membership illegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, on her work to date in the Department.  She has demonstrated a clear understanding of her brief and a willingness to give leadership and to listen.  Given her commitment and energy, I hope we will see further legislation in her name to the benefit of the marginalised and disabled.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill, if for no other reason than it focuses on nine important areas in which discrimination needs to be outlawed.  However, legislation on its own is of little use.  The Bill may give Ireland one of the most modern employment equality codes in Europe on paper but this will be of little use if it does not impact in a tangible way on every sector of society which is discriminated against.</P>
      <P>Social developments in each of the nine areas must be taken into account and the legislation backed up with funding and support mechanisms for employers.  Training and information technology are essential to make the legislation work and equip the various sectors to take their place within the mainstream workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Equality Act, l977, outlawed discrimination against women.  It was this Act, with the social changes in the l970s and l980s, that <Col N="516" /> brought women back into the workforce.  Community groups, State agencies and the personal commitment of individual women helped to reskill women in general and prepare them for entry into the workforce, which is ever changing.</P>
    <P>In spite of the fact that women account for four out of every ten jobs, it is not acceptable that senior positions in almost every sector are still dominated by men.  Women have much more to offer.  The glass ceiling should be removed once and for all from the workplace and real opportunities created for women.  Neither is it acceptable nor wise to create separate women's groups or positions within the workforce outside the mainstream system, just to accommodate the advancement of women.  The system must be all inclusive and without discrimination.  If this is a real situation we can claim there has been advancement.  However, I believe real advancement is not being achieved but that token positions are being made available to women.  Voluntary committees often include token women.  That is unacceptable and does not help the campaign to advance women in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces and Garda Síochána are typical examples of bodies in which women are discriminated against.  Advances have been made, but these are not significant when one considers the numbers and positions involved.  No real impact has been made.  The Defence Forces have recently made the involvement of women even more difficult by changing the height requirements and other qualifying measures.  This situation should be re-examined as a step towards removing discrimination in the Defence Forces, with a view to taking a more modern approach to recruitment.  Far more women would join the Defence Forces if these nonsensical restrictions were removed.</P>
    <P>Women do not find it easy to achieve senior positions as they have a higher mountain to climb in this regard.  There was a reference to the local government system, in which women are very poorly represented at management level.  The 29 county council managers are male and there is only one female assistant county manager.  There are also no real management positions occupied by women in the urban councils.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, had a long discussion on this issue during a recent visit to Kilkenny, in the course of which many of the problems faced by women within local government structures were raised.</P>
    <P>Political parties must also examine their systems to ensure women are not discriminated against.  It is a reflection on the whole political system that there are not more women in this House and local government.  That is a failure on the part of all political parties and I encourage change in this area to allow more women to become involved and take up the challenge of public position.  In that way we could achieve more women representatives in local and national government.</P>
    <P>These examples clearly demonstrate that while <Col N="517" /> legislation is helpful, the tangible results are fairly empty.  This Bill will have the same fate if we ignore the mechanisms required to make it operate in the workplace.  The greatest challenge in the workplace is faced by the disabled.  A concentrated effort is needed to train, and if necessary reskill, people with disabilities.  They must be given the opportunity of being capable to take up specific jobs.  Those who are skilled must not have to deal with the obstacle of physical barriers in the workplace.  Employers who are anxious to give employment and break down the barriers of discrimination must be assisted by the State in an immediate and tangible way.</P>
    <P>Given the developments in information technology, working from home with specialised hardware and software should be a real option for women who wish to return to the workplace &mdash; and the disabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>We are probably becoming a threatened species &mdash; we must be very careful.</P>
      <P>The State should support education and grants for this new style of work, as happens in countries which are more advanced than us.  Many people are able to return to the workforce as a result of technological advances.</P>
      <P>Recognition should be given to employers who are willing and proactive in their efforts to have an all inclusive workforce, male and female, able bodied and disabled.  That would show other employers what can be achieved, the abilities which exist and the innovative ideas which can attract the disabled and men and women in the home into the workforce. This new practice of working from home is not being encouraged, talked about or supported.  If it was, it would have a major impact on discrimination in the workforce.  The resulting expansion of the workforce would mean that more people would have a better quality of life and be able to offer more to society.</P>
      <P>The travelling community falls within the remit of the Government and local government.  That community is being truly discriminated against and few efforts are being made to break that cycle by making education available to it.  Some efforts are being made but we must put far more into the system if we are to break that cycle of discrimination, which begins at a very young age and the only way to prevent it is through education. We are very lax in our approach to providing that assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inability of the travelling community to participate in the workforce is discriminatory.  I am proud to say that at our meeting last week the Kilkenny enterprise board made four grants available to members of the travelling community who are involved in business to get them back into the workforce.  They sell carpets or other wares or provide services.  They do not recognise the system for one reason or another and we discriminate <Col N="518" /> against them by not involving them in the system.  We broke that cycle by making those four grants available and by providing them with business education.  That will have a positive impact.</P>
    <P>We also discriminate against the travelling community in terms of housing because housing policies are not necessarily all inclusive.  We must step out of the present system, step up our operation and get these people involved.</P>
    <P>It is up to all Departments to make resources available to marginalised communities so that they can break the cycle of poor education, not only for their children but also for themselves. Parents are entitled to return to the workforce. Given the developments in technology, it is becoming increasingly obvious that people will not retire at 40 or 50 years of age.  There are jobs available if one is in a position to re-educate and learn new skills within the system.  Employers will recruit from more mature members of the workforce.</P>
    <P>If we keep an open mind and are willing to provide finance we will be able to break the cycle of young people dropping out of the system.  A net will be provided to enable them participate in the local community and better educate themselves so that they will not face discrimination later in life.  If their parents are allowed avail of this system they also can become part of the rescue package which their children will seek.  In this regard, we must support youth links, youth programmes and community groups to allow them act as a net.  We must consider them in terms of the way the system discriminates against people.</P>
    <P>Adult education also needs to be developed to allow for the return of adults to second level or for making third level available to people who had to opt out of education at an early age.  The system should not discriminate against them because if they experience second or third level education they are able to educate their children at home, obtain new jobs for themselves and access information technology.  They are also able to provide themselves with new skills in their forties and fifties which will enable them return to the workforce.  The Government must, therefore, use all of the relevant agencies, including local government, to ensure this area is developed and that it does not act as a factor for discrimination in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  However, considerable work must be done in this area.  We should be aware of it because it affects all sectors of society. We should continue to enact legislation which will improve the lot of those who are discriminated against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with great pleasure that I find myself with an opportunity I did not think I would have to address this Bill because at the time it was introduced by the then Minster for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, I was not a Member of this House.  The referral of the Bill to the Supreme Court has provided the <Col N="519" /> House with an opportunity to fully debate it again.  In this regard I pay tribute to the Members of the Upper House who did such a good job in considering the legislation.  I also welcome the involvement of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, in piloting the legislation through this House.  Over the years she has shown through her work that she not only has an in-depth knowledge of the legislation but also a working knowledge of how it should be implemented.</P>
      <P>I am one of the veterans who helped draft the Employment Equality Bill of 1977.  I also served for five years on the Employment Equality Agency after it was established.  I welcome the huge change in mindsets since then.  We still have to cope with attitudes, especially with those affecting minorities and we are only beginning to challenge these.</P>
      <P>There are many horror stories from the 1970s when the concepts of equal pay and equal opportunity were first debated.  The proposal to discontinue advertising which included sexist wording we were told would almost destabilise society.  We must remember, however, that the warnings about the consequences in terms of the damage to the economy and the suggestion that women were their own worst enemies to be seeking this type of legislation because they would find themselves unemployed has echoes today in the reaction to proposals to introduce a minimum wage.</P>
      <P>We still have an employment pyramid, despite the equal pay Act and the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  The climb up the ladder for women from the broad base of underpayment and insecure employment is still very tenuous.  Given this, we need affirmative action when implementing the legislation.  We can spell out the implications of discrimination and how far, legally and constitutionally, we can go to remove them, but our society is permeated with a system of excluding all the people we are now trying to include.</P>
      <P>This huge challenge is unlikely to be met simply by passing this Bill into law and I hope a test case is taken challenging its provisions.  We also need to concentrate on the needs of the workplace and society to enable people participate equally.  This old debate needs to start again.  I welcome the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace.  I also welcome the contribution of Deputy O'Sullivan who added her considerable expertise to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate on affirmative action must start in this House.  Deputies McGuinness, Gilmore and others are right in pointing out that the House which has produced this legislation has a very small number of women in decision-making positions. Perhaps there should be a campaign to ensure that women get elected in the local elections next year.  The statistics on the lack of women at local government level is a reflection on our planning environment.  It is women who, <Col N="520" /> to a major extent, keep their communities going and improve society.  We therefore need to consider how women can be represented on the administrative side of local government.  It is astonishing that 21 years after the employment equality Act, there is no woman county manager, although women are central participants in an informal way in local government.</P>
    <P>If we are considering positive action and ways this legislation can be implemented effectively we must seriously promote child care facilities within the work place and the community.  There is no point in conning ourselves into thinking that women will be able to undertake training, seek promotion or break through the glass ceiling, to which we all refer, if we do not provide them with support facilities.  Deputy McGuinness rightly referred to the need for positive action programmes to encourage employers in this regard. They must also be provided at Government and State level.</P>
    <P>There are models which show how effective this strategy can be.  For instance, apart from providing, grant aiding and encouraging child care facilities as part and parcel of employment in Sweden, reward and bonus systems are built in for firms which actively and affirmatively encourage the training and promotion of women.  The State adopts a hands-on approach to this matter. State tenders have to be considered in terms of gender proofing and employers' provisions to cover employment and equal opportunities for women.  For the Bill to work, it must be underpinned by that type of structure.  This State does not need to make any excuse to give preferential treatment to employers who have an affirmative action programme for women and other minorities. Support was also provided through co-financing the provision of those facilities at State level.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a pilot programme, which has been allocated some EU funding and designed to encourage employers to provide child care facilities. The take up of the programme has been very positive.  While it was expected large firms would avail of it because it would suit them economically, a large number of small and medium sized firms have also availed of it.  I hope we are pushing an open door in this regard, but we need to take affirmative steps and put aside budgetary considerations.</P>
    <P>The State and social partners can support this area by showing how serious they are about the provision of parental leave.  Ireland is lamentably behind most other members states of the European Union in encouraging and implementing the provision of parental leave.  Most other member states have done major work on this and ensured that parental leave is financed, which is a key consideration. There is no sense in providing unpaid parental leave because we know who will be forced to leave work.  Unless we actively encourage the provision of paid parental leave for fathers as well as mothers, women, as well as our economy, will be in an extraordinarily weakened position <i>vis-a -vis</i> other countries.  I hope the training and <Col N="521" /> technology that drives our economy will demand that we do not lose members of our skilled, trained and professionally qualified workforce. We are all aware many women try to combine domestic and work responsibilities with little or no acknowledgement and their partners are not allowed, through any form of State intervention, to participate equally or even in a subsidiary position in the home through parental or paid leave. Eventually some of those people will be forced out of the workforce but we cannot allow that to happen.  Apart from the personal deprivation this presents to many women, our economy cannot afford to lose those members of the workforce.</P>
    <P>Attention must be paid in this legislation to employment regulations on age.  The Minister is aware many Deputies have talked about ageism and jobs for which there is an upper age limit.  At the Social Affairs Commission and the European Parliament levels it has been acknowledged there is an indirect discrimination against women on age grounds.  Many women today and those who were forced out of the workforce through the marriage bar or child care responsibilities find it almost impossible to rejoin the workforce.  There was a recommendation, if not a directive, that women in those circumstances should not only have access to mainstream employment retraining, but to specific retaining and confidence building programmes which would be EU funded. The economy is losing out because of the lack of participation of those people in the workforce. While this applies mainly to women it also applies to men who are long-term unemployed.  Women who are not on the live register do not have access to training programmes available to others. Not alone does the system not make sense in that it does not acknowledge the role mothers have played in the home, it does not make economic sense.  This area needs to be dealt with to back up this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am sure other Deputies share my concern and sense of depression that recently published FÁS apprenticeship training results reveal only 1 per cent of its apprentices are women.  That is the position in 1998, 21 years after equality legislation opened up those trades and apprenticeships to women.  There is something extraordinarily wrong with this position.  It requires the concerted efforts of school counselling, FÁS promotion and some type of State intervention, perhaps with the assistance of the affirmative action section of the legislation, to turn this position around.  Those results are a register of failure in this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the rights of women and other groups addressed in this legislation will be covered by legal and social support which does not exist at present.  Those structures must be built into the legislation.  I also welcome the human rights commission and the extra resources that I hope will be given to the equality authority. When implementing this legislation we need to seriously consider the area of legal aid.  Many of the people who need redress under this legislation will require access to free civil legal aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> Officials in the free legal aid centres have commented that a great number of workers who actively and successfully pursued claims have legal support.  It is worrying that many others who do not have access to that support have not had the opportunity to bring cases to court, this area needs to be examined.  Those officials also commented that the Employment Equality Agency has a legal section, but with one solicitor and three case workers it is understaffed.  They also believe the agency would be better occupied using its expertise to monitor, develop and provide information on the law in this area.  We need to provide access to free civil legal aid outside the authority and, perhaps, allow the legal unit of the authority to concentrate on monitoring, evaluating and informing.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have said part of the danger associated with introducing legislation to include those who are excluded and provide measures to remove discrimination is that an intensive programme of information and support is required.  This would enable those who feel they have a case on discrimination grounds to have the support to test it.  One of the provisions in the Bill I welcome changes the position under the first equality legislation where the burden of proof was placed on the worker.  He or she had to take the case and prove it rather than the employer having to take responsibility for discrimination.  This must be changed.  However, the area of sexual harassment still needs to be considered.  The Bill places a huge onus on a complainant to carry their case alone and try to prove it.  We are aware from women and men who attempted to take cases that it can be a lonely and alienating process.  For various reasons they may not get much support in pursuing cases in the workplace.  This aspect needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the need to concentrate more on discrimination against travellers. The Irish Traveller Movement has made recommendations which should be taken seriously.  It is patronising to tell travellers what is good for them and how they should behave when we should be listening to them and understanding their needs. From the comments of Deputy McGuinness, and others, it appears we can are coming to terms with that issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is a foundation stone for the rights of citizens, excluded people and minority groups.  All the power of legislation and our influence should be brought to bear to ensure another minority group involving refugees is not created and discriminated against.  This Bill, and the legislation relating to refugees and asylum seekers, should be enacted urgently to deal with this matter. It would be ironic if we managed to come to terms with and perhaps even counter some of the discrimination with which Irish citizens have coped &mdash; I pay tribute to all the groups who have lobbied consistently on the issues covered by the legislation &mdash; but left the most vulnerable, excluded and voiceless people outside the remit <Col N="523" /> and protection of the Bill.  Politicians are responsible for ensuring that in removing discrimination against some groups, we do not burden others with intolerance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  The debate on the equality Bill of 1996 lasted from October 1996 to April 1997.  The legislation was examined carefully in both Houses.  Unfortunately, it failed on three constitutional grounds, perhaps because the legislators were trying too hard to protect the interests of disabled people in the workplace.</P>
      <P>This is significant legislation which outlaws discrimination in employment on nine distinct grounds &mdash; age, race, religion, family status, marital status, gender, disability, sexual orientation and membership of the travelling community.  It is broad ranging and comprehensive in its scope and deals with all employment related areas, including access to employment, vocational training, trade unions and general working conditions. It also covers collective agreements as well as discriminatory advertising in newspapers, on the Internet and in all other media.</P>
      <P>In many respects it is ground breaking legislation because Ireland does not have a great reputation for employment equality.  Flagrant violations of the principles of equality are found throughout the workplace.  Even the public service is not free of inequalities.  Women and disabled people are the principal sufferers, but this legislation is ground breaking in an EU context. For example, Britain has legislation on race relations, sexual discrimination and disability.  In Northern Ireland there is also legislation prohibiting discrimination on religious grounds. However, we must look as far afield as Australia to find legislation as broad ranging in scope as this Bill.  Once passed, it will give Ireland one of the most modern equality codes in Europe.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of whether we like it, society is radically changing.  These changes, which have been most noticeable in recent years, have had a profound effect on the workplace.  It is hard to believe that until relatively recently places of work were populated mainly by men with permanent jobs, most of whom regarded them as jobs for life.  Society took it for granted that women who entered the workforce would occupy the lowest rung of the career ladder.  It was expected that they would retire on marriage or after their first child was born and devote the rest of their lives to home duties.  In such times there was little need for change, adaptability or flexibility. Consequently, matters remained unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the current day workplace bears little resemblance to the workplace of old. Change is now accepted as part and parcel of everyday working life.  The evolving work environment now consists of a wide variety of employment options, including frequent job changes, temporary jobs, part-time work, job sharing and flexitime.  It is now populated by women and men, <Col N="524" /> able bodied and disabled, who all demand their right to a full role in economic life, including a proper place in a more flexible workplace.  These changes are particularly noticeable in the case of married women.  In 1971 only 14 per cent of women in the workplace were married.  Today, approximately half the female workforce is married. These changes have brought about a significant shift in the structure of the world of work and have led to a growing awareness of the need to reconcile work and family life to safeguard competitiveness and effectiveness of enterprise while at the same time allowing women and men to devote a sufficient amount of time to their families.</P>
    <P>However, while women have steadily increased their participation in the workforce, they have not been equally successful in achieving positions at the higher level of professions or the organisations in which they work.  Women have been the victims of direct and indirect discrimination. There is a continuing trend for women to be grouped in professions and industrial sectors where low pay traditionally has been the norm.  The challenge now is to put measures in place to help women build on the gains they have secured in the labour market.  The Bill will encourage a more active approach to tackling these obstacles.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill the new equality authority is given statutory powers to conduct equality audits in employment generally and in particular sectors so that progress towards equality can be reviewed and action plans put in place.  Since fewer people are guaranteed a job for life, more older people than ever are seeking work.  With the workplace becoming much more fluid and complex, the issue of employment equality becomes not only an economic imperative but must be regarded and dealt with as a fundamental human right.  Every individual has a basic human right to seek and obtain gainful employment and to progress through to promotion.  It is imperative that our laws prohibit discrimination based on personal characteristics which are unconnected with work performance.</P>
    <P>The interests of social justice also dictate that older workers should not continue to suffer systematic disadvantage in the labour market as a result of the application of outmoded or discriminatory criteria for selection for employment or training.  Unfortunately, discrimination in the workplace is not an illusion; sadly for many people it is a reality.  Labour force surveys show that older workers, once unemployed, are likely to remain so for much longer than their younger counterparts.  One of the important policy aims of the Bill is to change this type of behaviour in the interest of social justice as well as from a public policy perspective.</P>
    <P>Another area of discrimination which is unfortunately and regrettably widespread relates to disability.  An 1991 official report by the European Commission concluded that people with disabilities in Ireland represented 7 per cent of the population.  A labour force survey conducted by <Col N="525" /> the Commission two years earlier concluded that &ldquo;the chances of someone with a disability being unemployed are significantly higher than someone without a disability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Two of the three aspects of the 1996 Bill which were judged to be unconstitutional were deemed to be technical in nature and I will not go into them, but the third referred to equality of employment for people with disabilities.  The 1996 Bill required the employer, arising out of the employment of a person with a disability, in certain circumstances to provide special treatment and facilities unless he or she could show undue hardship.  The Supreme Court decided this provision constituted an unjust attack on the property rights of the employer contrary to Article 43 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the new Bill the Minister was prevented from obliging employers to meet the cost of these facilities, other than of a minimal nature.  Yet reasonable accommodation, depending on the extent or nature of the disability, can and does involve the provision of facilities such as ramps, low level fittings and reading equipment as well as special working hours.  A wide variety of equipment and facilities are required to ensure equality of opportunity for access to employment.  It is obvious from the Supreme Court decision that the onus cannot be placed fully on the employer and in these circumstances the State has an obligation to set the process in train to put in place positive measures to meet these needs.</P>
    <P>Tributes must be paid to the many voluntary organisations and bodies who have done trojan work in the relentless fight for the needs and rights of their disabled members.  The Government is concerned to ensure the fruits of the economic boom and prosperity are availed of to promote the rights of our disabled who constitute a significant minority and to provide them with the opportunities to participate fully in the workplace as well as in all other aspects of society.</P>
    <P>I commend announcements and decisions in recent months by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and other Ministers to provide additional resources and funding for all areas of disability.  I pay tribute to my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, for her interest in and dedication to the issue of disability, not only as Minister but as spokesperson prior to being appointed as Minister. She does a vast amount of work for those people not only in the constituency but across the country.  I wish her well and compliment her.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to establish a national disability authority.  Substantial additional resources will be needed through grant aid and other means to ensure equality of opportunity for access to employment and training is available to the disabled on the same basis as to any other group in society.  That is the core issue.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate <Col N="526" /> and assure them the views they expressed will be carefully examined in the weeks ahead.  The ambition of the Government, and of the previous Government, has been to develop anti-discrimination legislation which provides protection on a very wide range of grounds.  The Bill realises this ambition and, in doing so, will place Ireland among the most advanced EU member states in tackling discrimination in employment.  Some Deputies may have overlooked the considerable merits and the ground-breaking nature of this important initiative, but the vast majority of contributions were extremely positive and helpful.  It is important to recognise that this legislation has adopted a sophisticated rights-based model and has tackled a broad range of complex, legal, social and economic considerations.  The Bill strikes an appropriate balance between these various considerations and is sensitive to the many issues involved.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a number of points raised by speakers.  The question of the equality authority was raised by Deputies Fitzgerald, O'Sullivan and Barnes.  The Deputies mentioned the importance of funding for the new infrastructure.  The Government is committed to put in place an effective functioning infrastructure that will publicise the benefits of the new Bill and work for the promotion of equal opportunities for the provision of redress.  An indication of this commitment is that funding of £2.1 million has been secured in this year's budget for the new arrangements. This provision covers costs associated with the present level of activity in the Employment Equality Agency as well as once-off accommodation costs for the new institution.</P>
      <P>The question of sexual harassment was raised by Deputies Barnes, O'Sullivan, Fitzgerald and other Deputies.  They spoke of the need for a publicity campaign to appraise people of their rights regarding sexual harassment.  Section 54(4) enables approved codes of practice to be admitted in evidence in proceedings under the Bill. Given that a code of practice has been adopted in this area, approval for a code on this subject under the Bill would be possible soon after the Bill as passed is brought into operation.  This will enforce the protective approach currently applied in respect of sexual harassment.  The conducting of a wide-ranging publicity campaign in conjunction with the new equality authority to create an awareness of people's rights in the area of sexual harassment is important.  I am confident the new authority will be as successful in achieving these aims as is the Employment Equality Agency today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brady referred to the national disability authority.  I thank the Deputy for his positive comments.  An establishment group with the task of preparing detailed proposals for the establishment of a national disability authority was set up in November last year and is well advanced in its deliberations.  It is also examining the question of a disability support service.  As Deputy O'Sullivan indicated, departmental responsibility for the <Col N="527" /> training and employment of people with disability currently resides with the Department of Health and Children, reflecting the old medical model of disability rather than the currently favoured social rights model.</P>
    <P>The transfer of certain responsibilities from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is engaging the attention of the establishment group.  Preliminary work on the legislative provisions required for the establishment of a national disability authority and disability support service is under way in the Department.  The decision of 18 November asked the establishment group to report back in six months as regards the work involved.</P>
    <P>Disability issues were raised by many Deputies, in particular by Deputy Brady who gave a comprehensive view on the issue.  I thank him for his positive remarks on the disability area.  On the important question of reasonable accommodation, which was raised by many Deputies, I received a range of proposals for changes to the provisions of the Bill relating to disability and the question of reasonable accommodation.  The provisions, which are the subject of the proposals, are those which in the main have been amended to take account of the Supreme Court judgment concerning their unconstitutionality.  The observations of Deputies also focused on these provisions.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise the complexity of the issues involved, which should not be under-estimated. We discussed these complexities when the Bill was debated in the Seanad.  Arising from those concerns, provisions in the Bill were examined most carefully.  Unfortunately, it has not yet proved possible to develop a formula of words to pass the test of legal certainty and constitutionality and the test of acceptability to people with disabilities.  I give a commitment that I will continue to examine these provisions, particularly between now and Committee Stage, to see what more we can do.</P>
    <P>On the important question of nominal costs, to which Deputies O'Sullivan, Fitzgerald and Brady referred, it is important to recognise the nominal nature in section 35(4).  I suggest the term &ldquo;nominal&rdquo;, as used in the Bill, may be interpreted in a relative sense.  In other words, what may be considered nominal by a large business employing hundreds of people may not be the same as that considered nominal by a small employer with only a few employees.  As I indicated in my opening speech to which Deputy Brady referred, an important part of the nominal cost factor is to take into consideration that State supports for workplace adaptation and equipment will be taken into account as well as any costs borne by the employer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked fundamental questions about the success of equality legislation in tackling the vertical and horizontal segregation in the labour market which still persists.  Deputy <Col N="528" /> McGuinness also took up this important issue and gave us some insights into the problems of dealing with the glass ceiling in all aspects of Irish life from the Defence Forces to local authorities to political parties.  The issue was also raised by Deputies Barnes and Fitzgerald, who was with me on the Women's Rights Committee when we trashed this out on many occasions.  A point made by Deputy Barnes, and others, was that despite the existence of equal pay and employment equality legislation, women remain in certain careers and do not seem to make it up through the lines.  It is an issue we must keep to the forefront until it is addressed across the board.</P>
    <P>Like all Members, I appreciate that equality of opportunity and employment cannot be achieved solely through legislative provisions in that it also requires a greater recognition of the value and contribution of equality opportunity policies in employment.  These features in the Bill, as Deputies Collins and Brady, so perceptively observed, will underscore measures to promote equality in employment.  Positive action, codes of practice, equality reviews and action plans all have valuable potential in this regard.  We must always try to support this position.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is undertaking a study in conjunction with the Employment Equality Agency to obtain more information on the underlying reasons for the continuation of the persistent male-female wage gap.  I hope we can build on this information through the new proactive powers of the proposed equality authority to begin to change this unfortunate fact in the Irish and international labour markets.  I take the points made by Deputies that there is ample room to advance further the drive towards equal opportunities.  I am already tackling the issue by developing policies for the reconciliation of work and family life.  Many of the points raised by Deputy Barnes were important, particularly those concerned with the area of child care.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald said, we are now operating in a completely different culture and environment than that which existed when employment equality legislation was first introduced 20 years ago.  In the Ireland of today, an appropriate infrastructure is necessary to facilitate parents to fully participate in the labour market while at the same time carry on family responsibilities.  This need has become all the more stark in recent years with forecast demographic changes in the labour force both in Europe and at home and the tight labour market which exists in our buoyant economy.  Deputy Barnes made the point that Ireland cannot afford to do without these people in the workplace.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, women comprise almost 40 per cent of the labour force and for these reasons and, more particularly, because of the principle of equality, the Government is committed to the introduction of family friendly initiatives.  In accordance with Partnership 2,000 and the EU directive on parental leave, the Government will introduce a parental leave Bill which will entitle <Col N="529" /> parents of young children to three months leave to help them reconcile work and child rearing responsibilities.  Work on a Bill to give effect to these arrangements is well advanced in the Department.  In accordance with other commitments under the partnership, the expert working group on child care under the aegis of our Department was established last July.  This expert working group, which is representative of all major players in the child care area in the public, private and voluntary sectors, was established to develop a co-ordinated policy for child care and the group is due to report back to Government in December.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes made some interesting suggestions about mainstreaming and positive action measures.  I note her concern that suitable levels of budgetary provisions be set aside to develop these initiatives.  I am most interested in the proposals for mainstreaming gender equality in the context of the round of the community support framework post-1999 and look forward to exploring the policy options which will present themselves for the support of employment and equal opportunities into the early years of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore referred to section 37(1).  A provision on the lines of this subsection is essential. The text of the provision is the culmination of a long process of consultation bearing in mind the Constitution.  The section, as it stands, represents a reasonable and measured balance between very different views on a complex and sensitive issue.  The provision benefits considerably from the constructive submissions made by the various interests in this area and demonstrates the Government's commitment to protecting the legitimate interests of all concerned.  In particular, this provision benefits considerably from the constructive submissions made by both teachers and churches.</P>
    <P>It is not a victory for one side over the other but rather the Government's best effort to find the right balance which protects the legitimate interest of both.  In so far as it gives discretion and flexibility to denominational bodies, it does so in order to support the development of greater pluralism in Irish society and to afford due respect for the certain rights of minorities in the State.  However, this discretion is made subject to certain clear criteria and is subject to adjudication on a case by case basis by an independent director of equality investigations and by the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Supreme Court in its consideration of the Bill following the Article 26 referral by the President last year, gave considerable attention to this particular provision and, ultimately, held it to be constitutional.  Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the powers conferred on the director of equality investigations and the Labour Court under the Bill to enter premises, obtain information, etc.  These powers are analogous to those contained in existing employment <Col N="530" /> equality legislation and are common in labour legislation.  They are well founded to enable the director and the Labour Court to effectively investigate disputes under the legislation, particularly in the event of a failure to co-operate with the investigation by any of the parties involved.  I hope the Deputy will review her position in light of these considerations.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Gilmore has concerns about the height requirement for recruitment to the Garda Síochána.  I draw his attention to the nature of the exclusion which recognises the different characteristics of men and women as regards height while at the same time responding to the security, public safety and policing benefits of having a Garda force whose height profile is taller than the population at large.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald drew attention to the complexities of the Bill and the fact it is not as accessible as it might be.  The style of the Bill has been dictated by the necessarily complex and constitutional difficult issues covered in the legislation. An explanatory leaflet entitled &ldquo;The Employment Equality Bill, 1997&rdquo; has been available free of charge from the Department since the Bill was published in December.  This leaflet is now accessible on the Department's Internet website and the Deputy can be assured that when this important legislation is enacted, a comprehensive, readable guide will be made available to an appropriately wide audience.  That issue was also of concern to Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the new centrality of equality legislation, both in employment and equal status, in the context of developments for peace on this island.  This centrality is linked, in turn, to the emerging consciousness that equality of opportunities is not just an employment issue mainly affecting women but a basic human right.  The Employment Equality Bill is one essential element in forging a more equal and just society here for the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a central element in the Government's programme to advance equality and is a vital step in the process towards the elimination of discrimination.  In this regard, the Bill contains many important and innovative provisions.  For the first time in the history of the State, the Defence Forces will be legally obliged to ensure they do not discriminate on grounds of sex.  There is scope for the development of positive action measures to combat existing inequalities and the law in relation to sexual harassment has been codified.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets in place the infrastructure for equality in the new millennium.  There will be a new Office of the Director of Equality Investigations to hear claims for redress under the Bill, and further equal status legislation.  The Employment Equality Agency will be replaced by the new equality authority with new powers to develop statute based codes of practice and to audit and review the advancement of equal opportunity programmes and policies at enterprise level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> The Bill has been developed in response to a broad and extensive consultation process and the constitutionality difficulties identified by the Supreme Court.  I know some people hold the view that the Bill might have had a wider scope. I understand also that others regard it as over generous in several of its provisions.  It is a matter of judgment to balance the complex legal, social and economic issues involved so as to achieve viable legislation.  I am always pleased to consider alternative proposals which seek to refine the balance. I look forward to studying in detail the proposals for amendment tabled on Committee Stage.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate and I assure them their comments will be considered before Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not interested in political squabbles about who should introduce this important Bill.  On behalf of the vast majority of the 1.7 million people who partake in organised sport or some type of physical activity we must ensure that we enact the best possible legislation to put the national sports council on a statutory basis.  It is the perception of the vast majority of men and women who partake in organised sport, and of the thousands of volunteers, men and women, who give of their time to organise and manage teams, that Governments and politicians have neglected sport over the years.  The sight of these same politicians, <Col N="532" /> including myself, making their way to Dublin Airport to welcome home successful Irish teams and athletes in a blaze of publicity has been seen as a cynical exercise.  I recall reading in one of our newspapers, when Michael Carruth returned home having won a gold medal at the Olympic games, that money and resources would be pumped into boxing.  That these promises have not been honoured is a scandal, particularly when boxing is a popular sport in many of the most disadvantaged communities.  Thankfully there seems to be a change in the attitude of politicians and Government.  However, we will all be judged by our actions.  Sport contributes in a very significant way to social and economic development. The benefits can be classified in terms of health and lifestyle, sport and achievement, tourism and economic benefit to the country, personal development, social and cultural development. All of the information available clearly shows that for young people participation in sport is an alternative to involvement in a life of crime and anti-social activities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has indicated that he proposes to review the allocation of lottery money for major recreational facilities.  In the past these allocations were alleged to have been politically motivated.  In many cases the more affluent and organised an area, the more grants it received.  In contrast, areas of need where an organised community lobbying structure was not in place lost out on lottery funding.  There is a requirement under the present scheme that needs to be reassessed.  I understand that grants will be paid out on receipts received for work carried out after the date of the allocation.  Recently, 220 projects throughout the country were allocated grants.  Because of the escalation of building costs, unsuccessful organisations will not be able to await the next allocation before proceeding with their project.  In many cases they will secure a bank overdraft to proceed.  It would be totally wrong if the existing scheme were to discriminate against such clubs in the event of their securing a grant in the future by preventing them drawing down the grant.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that high achievers in sport are ambassadors for Ireland and have helped attract thousands of visitors to this country. I would include in this category Irish soccer supporters, particularly during the Jack Charlton reign.  These supporters were highly commended throughout their journeys across Europe and America and many American, German and French people came here on holidays because of the performance of these supporters.  The decision taken to start the l998 Tour de France in Ireland is an example of this.  This event is expected to receive television coverage in up to 100 countries with an estimated audience of nearly 100 million people.  This could not have been achieved without the earlier success of Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly on the roads of Europe.  In the light of this, it is scandalous that the company behind the Irish section of this tour <Col N="533" /> could not find a position for Stephen Roche in the overall operation of this event.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer briefly to drugs in sport. Let me say clearly that my contribution on this issue is in no way linked to today's allegations against Michelle de Bruin.  Any person who takes performance enhancing substances to improve his or her performance is a cheat.  These people must be identified and banished from both the national and the international scene.  Unfortunately, some of the international governing bodies have not been prepared to stand up to these cheats.  It is scandalous that athletes who have been found guilty of drug taking at major events such as the Olympic Games have been allowed back following a short suspension.  An example of this is the former world record holder and Olympic champion Ben Johnson who shamed the sport when he was exposed as a cheat.  The entire subject of drugs in sport is surrounded by rumour and suspicion. Accordingly, we need a world-wide co-ordinated approach to eliminate drugs in sport forever.  Drug taking can be controlled only if a testing strategy is effective and the penalties act as a sufficient deterrent.  At national level our administrations must develop a national anti-drug strategy that covers all sporting activities at a certain level.  I look forward to the report of the anti-drug advisory committee set up by the Minister. I congratulate the Minister on setting it up and hope he will bring forward his proposals at a very early date.</P>
    <P>According to the National Rehabilitation Board there are up to 350,000 people in Ireland with a disability.  Such people have a right to partake in sporting activities.  It is imperative that the Sports Council of Ireland put in place a plan that will eliminate all the obstacles which deprive people with a disability of the opportunity to engage in sport.  The national lottery was originally set up in l987 to raise funds for worthy causes.  Since its launch, £800 million has been raised for distribution by Government to good causes.  However, it is important to note that in l988 51 per cent of the lottery allocation went directly for sport, recreation and amenities whereas in l997 this allocation was down to 31 per cent.  There is a case to increase this allocation. One grant scheme which comes to mind is the youth and sport grant.  Under it, the most we can give to each sports club in Fingal is £97 and that is taking into account the voluntary effort people make.  Much more money should be allocated to this grant scheme.  I hope this Bill, or a similar one, will be passed as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on this important topic.  I commend the Government on its commitment to the vital <Col N="534" /> yet neglected areas of sport and recreation.  No action reflects this commitment better that the decision to establish a separate Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation so that the interests of Ireland's sportspeople, whether at professional or amateur level, are represented at the Cabinet for the first time in the history of this State, and represented with ability and foresight by the Minister, Deputy McDaid.</P>
      <P>We all know the importance of sport in terms of promoting fitness and wellbeing.  It is essential for creating a truly healthy and vibrant society.  It also promotes a positive image of our country to the world as our professional athletes are truly our ambassadors at international level.  We all feel a sense of pride when we see our flag raised and our anthem played at an international event. I congratulate Catherina McKiernan from Cavan on her memorable victory in the London marathon and wish her continued success in future.</P>
      <P>The Government's interest in sport and recreation is enshrined in the programme for Government.  The Government is committed to the establishment of a fully functional and efficient national sports council bringing together all sporting interests and activities.  This will act as a dynamo for the further development of sport. It is important to ensure that the council is properly established to carry on this important contribution to moulding our future.  To be effective, such a body must have a solid statutory foundation. It must also have a clear and precise set of objectives.  It is obvious the Government is determined to establish this council, and to ensure that it is set up properly.</P>
      <P>Sport is a necessary part of the growth of the individual, as important as formal education in its own way.  For that reason, the Government wants to introduce a greater role for sport and training in the school curriculum.  Sport boosts self-confidence and self-reliance, instilling a sense of personal achievement and pride at what has been gained by effort and endurance.  Young people achieve a sense of how good it feels to be fit and in good health.  They not only earn respect for the hard knocks that sport often throws at them, whether they be the inevitable failures and defeats or the occasional injury, but they also learn the importance of team spirit and how co-operation and the pooling of talent brings the best results.  Sport is also a very effective weapon in the fight against drug abuse as it offers a clear and attractive alternative to the misery and suffering of dependence on artificial stimulants.</P>
      <P>Sport and recreation policy must embrace all in the community.  It is easy to forget that sport and fitness must be accessible to the disabled.  For that reason, I welcome the commitment by the Government to provide support for the hosting of the Special Olympics here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation is already making a positive difference. Its funding allocation has been increased to £26 million, a clear demonstration of the Government's desire to augment the resources available <Col N="535" /> for sports and recreation.  A scheme has been established to support high performance athletes whose requirements for training must be catered for if they are to perform at their best.  All must be done to cultivate the cream of our sporting talent, and such a scheme will enable those who have been blessed with extraordinary gifts to reveal them to the world.</P>
    <P>A figure of £3.7 million has been allocated to the various governing bodies for sport in Ireland to enable them to pursue their interests.  It is obvious to us all that those bodies are often the best places from which to administer funding as they have direct contact with those participating in their respective sports at both professional and amateur level.  Furthermore, funding of £4.9 million has been granted to separate projects around the country.  More money obviously needs to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Government is aware that much remains to be done.  It wants and needs to promote greater involvement by the private sector in all aspects of sport.  Televised sport has brought an appreciation of new games and activities to Ireland with the result that the number of sports being practised is growing.  We must ensure that the sports which appear to be minority interests are catered for and that funding, either public or private, is directed towards them.</P>
    <P>We are all grateful for the sacrifices of people such as Catherina McKiernan, Michelle de Bruin and others in bringing immense honour to our country.  For most of us, it is hard to comprehend or visualise the commitment which lies behind these performances, the hours spent in training, sometimes on dark, cold evenings after a day's work, with little or no material incentive except the reward of overcoming yet another challenge or chalking up another personal best.</P>
    <P>The world of sport has become much more professional in recent years.  This is in part a reflection of the greater cost of technology in training. However, let us not forget the invaluable contribution made by voluntary sporting organisations. One of the oldest is the Gaelic Athletic Association but there are numerous others whose members have been stimulated by selfless dedication to the enjoyment of their respective sports. This dedication can sometimes last a lifetime, beginning at school and continuing into adulthood. For those people there is no astronomical pay cheque after each event, no high flying lifestyle and no rubbing shoulders with the world's beautiful people.  When injury strikes, there is no pampering at exclusive resorts or health centres. There is only the hope for an understanding employer.  Even when such sportspeople come to the end of their competitive careers, many continue their association through training and nurturing the next generation or through administration in a local club.  All this is done voluntarily, the only tangible gains being a few medals gained along the way to be cherished and handed on to children and grandchildren.  The <Col N="536" /> world of sport in Ireland must be inspired by these people and their unpaid efforts.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, there are huge costs involved in providing facilities throughout the country.  I hope when he restructures the recreational facilities grants scheme a substantial increase in funding will be provided to enable many voluntary groups obtain assistance in their efforts to provide recreational sporting facilities for our people.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I recognise the need for the establishment of a national sports council.  This was clearly set out in our election manifesto and, as Deputy Allen knows, a Bill is currently with the parliamentary draftsman on this issue.  The Minister, Deputy McDaid, will bring it before the House in the next few weeks.  Deputy Allen has jumped the gun on this occasion.  This is becoming a habit with the Opposition as Deputy Upton did something similar recently when he introduced his Bill to amend the licensing laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I call that initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Allen on a number of good ideas of which I am sure the Minister will take account when he brings a more inclusive Bill before the House in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen was the Minister of State with responsibility for sport in the previous Administration. Why, if this council was so essential, did he not initiate it when he was Minister?  I accuse him of poaching a good idea from the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That said, there are a number of good ideas in what Deputy Allen has proposed. I read through the Bill and was pleased to see that he had gender proofed the first section in that the Minister can be male or female, something Deputy Barnes will be delighted to hear. However, I am sorry to tell her that the chief executive of the council is referred to as being a man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one has shown a greater commitment to sport than the current Administration and this was demonstrated when we came into Government. The Taoiseach appointed a senior Minister with responsibility for sport and everyone recognises that the Minister, Deputy McDaid, is doing an excellent job.  Our track record since we came into office has been second to none.  The new dynamic Department has provided £26 million for sport, double the 1997 figure.  In addition, a special scheme of support for high performance athletes was announced recently.  This is in recognition of the great commitment and dedication of some of our great achievers, including Michelle de Bruin, Catherina McKiernan and Sonia O'Sullivan, <Col N="537" /> who have brought great pride to our country. A sum of £3.6 million has been provided for the national governing bodies, an increase of 7 per cent on what was provided by the previous Administration.  More recently 220 projects were allocated a sum of £4.9 million and I am delighted County Mayo benefited.</P>
    <P>A number of major events, such as the Tour de France, the Ryder Cup and the Special Olympics in 2003, will take place here in the next few years. I acknowledge Deputy Allen's contribution in securing some of those events for Ireland.  I know the Minister, Deputy McDaid, will carry on that excellent work and bring it to fruition.  The Government is showing its commitment by providing financial aid for those great events.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's commitment to sport is well documented.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is responsible for tackling drugs in sport, a matter which is widely discussed in the sporting arena throughout the world.  I was extremely proud of the achievements of Michelle de Bruin when she won three gold medals and a bronze for Ireland at the Atlanta Olympics.  It is a shame she has not received the recognition or financial rewards an athlete of her calibre deserves. Regardless of what happens in future, she is one of the finest athletes we have ever produced.  She is a credit to the country and I wish people in the media would realise that.  In competitive sport there will always be those who knock others, but we support our own.  The same applies to athletes such as Sonia O'Sullivan and Catherina McKiernan, who had an excellent performance recently.</P>
    <P>Excluding Croke Park, spending on sport increased by 46 per cent this year.  This is proof of the Government's dedication and commitment in this area.  We should devise an overall strategy for sport.  It is appalling that 41 per cent of people do not engage in sporting activities during their leisure time.  This is due to inadequate infrastructure in many counties.  I believe the Minister is working on a national strategy to alleviate this problem.  It is interesting to note that £3.1 billion per annum is spent on health and, while even more needs to be spent in this area, we must also try to prevent illness.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider spending a percentage of this budget on the provision of sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>A total of £50 million is needed to upgrade swimming pools built approximately 25 years ago. All those pools, one of which is located in Castlebar, are in a state of disrepair.  I understand from Deputy Allen, however, that there is an excellent facility near him in Cork.  I am optimistic that all swimming pools will be upgraded because they provide an essential service to communities.</P>
    <P>I referred to the disbursement of lotto funding and the question of accountability some months ago.  There is nobody more accountable to the people than the elected representatives.  We have to knock on doors and seek people's support in every election.  I do not believe any council or body could be as accountable or responsible.  I have always believed the disbursement of lotto <Col N="538" /> funds should be carried out by the Minister who is answerable to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister will bring an inclusive Bill before the House in the near future which will incorporate some of Deputy Allen's ideas.  I ask him, therefore, to withdraw his Bill and wait for the more inclusive policy which will be in the best interest of sport, something dear to his heart.</P>
    <P>I note he was studying the document in regard to the gender issue while I was speaking; I am sure it was a mere drafting error.  I thank the Deputy for his contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney" hpid="Mr. Moloney Mr. Moloney">

      <P>I recognise the importance of establishing a statutory sports council.  I also acknowledge the Minister's commitment to this area in the past few weeks.  I understand work is well under way on drafting a sports council Bill and I prefer to await its publication.  I am satisfied the Minister and the Government are committed to fostering and promoting sport and recognise the need to establish a national sports council. The Government has a good track record in this regard.</P>
      <P>Since the Government established a senior sports ministry, funding for sports has doubled to the tune of £26 million.  A special scheme of support for high performance athletes has also been announced.  I also welcome the £3.6 million approved for national governing bodies as well as the 220 projects that have been grant aided in the past few months.  Work is also well advanced on a national anti-doping programme.  The Government is committed, in particular, to tackling drug abuse in sport.</P>
      <P>I pay special tribute to the work carried out by voluntary sports groups, but they cannot live on fresh air.  Players and participants have a right to decent and safe playing areas and facilities.  I ask the Minister to take account of the tremendous voluntary work done by those organisations.  It is obvious that sports halls need proper heating and lighting.  Some sports require specialist equipment, such as bicycles and canoes, and while they can prove expensive, they are a prerequisite for the enjoyment of the sport concerned.  Other expenses include bus hire, equipment, insurance and many other overheads.  I appeal to the Minister to recognise the valuable contribution of voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases the costs involved may require an outside commercial sponsor.  We should encourage more participation by the private sector in providing sporting facilities and equipment. In certain circumstances they could be covered by small financial grants from the State to sporting clubs.  We should also recognise the immense contribution these associations and clubs make to their members and through them to the wider <Col N="539" /> community.  Such small scale financial assistance could make a difference between a sports club declining into oblivion and becoming a go-ahead association attracting an ever increasing membership.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his involvement to date and look forward to the publication of his Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen's Bill gives us an opportunity to examine the lack of proper sporting facilities, particularly in rural areas.  There are numerous leisure centres and hotels with major sporting facilities in most urban areas, but GAA and handball clubs are the only sporting facilities in many rural areas.  Some people have to travel ten or 15 miles to avail of facilities in large provincial towns.</P>
      <P>Participation in sport should be encouraged from infant classes in national school so that children learn how to mix socially from an early stage.  Many five or six year olds go home to watch &ldquo;The Simpsons&rdquo; rather than participate in sporting or leisure activities.  This is especially the case today when, in many cases, it is necessary for both parents to go to work.  Parents are not able to give time to young people, to get them involved and help them to develop their natural talents.  Young people suffer as a result.  I hope when the Bill is in place that, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, there will be a sports programme to encourage young people to get involved from an early age.</P>
      <P>We can all criticise Bills.  This Bill is premature but it has given us an opportunity to express our views prior to the Bill which Deputy McDaid will bring forward in the not too distant future.  I also hope that major national sporting centres will not be based in the major urban areas.  One such centre has been spoken of in relation to my part of the country by the National Rowing Association. I hope that could be progressed.  The international experts who appraised the project stated that County Leitrim was the number one location.</P>
      <P>When allocating moneys to sports organisations we should ensure that some of the money ends up in local clubs.  There is no use in building up large administrations which do not allow money to filter down.  We all know that there are schemes for elite athletes.  This was proven by Catherina McKiernan's performance which shows that our athletes can compete at the highest levels.  This evening Ken Doherty progressed to the semi-finals of the world snooker championship. Some might say that this is a leisurely sport but it is highly competitive.  It is a sport which is only available to those who have access to facilities at an early age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In future, at least 70 per cent of State money allocated from the Exchequer or the lottery should work its way down to local organisations and clubs to help upgrade facilities.  There is no use in building large centres which do not serve <Col N="540" /> the people of rural Ireland.  The major cities are able to provide their own facilities because commercial funds are available.  Rural areas are dependent on raffle tickets or church gate or house to house collections to put facilities in place.  In future, I hope that we will see a better distribution of funds for all sports.  No one sport should be singled out for special treatment.</P>
    <P>Television has a major role to play in sport. Some sports do not get an equal share of television time.  This was evident last weekend when the major coverage of Catherina McKiernan's performance came from Sky and other British channels.  RTE's sports coverage should be more balanced so that smaller sports get extra time. Soccer games covered this season involved Dublin teams.  A match between Cork City and Sligo Rovers was very unlikely to be given airtime.  If Shelbourne, St. Pats or Shamrock Rovers were playing the game was more likely to receive airtime. When the Minister comes forward with his Bill it will help to set the guidelines for sport for the next 20 to 30 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I pay tribute to those who have worked voluntarily and diligently to further the cause of a variety of sports and the athletes who have committed time and energy and have put this country on the international sporting map.  I congratulate Catherina McKiernan from County Cavan on her great recent achievements.  She has brought great honour to this country.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister recognises the importance of sport to the well-being of society.  I welcome the 46 per cent increase in allocations for sporting developments.  This is the first Government to recognise the value of sport and its potential to contribute to an improved society. This country has a wealth of sporting talent.  As legislators we must ensure that there is a climate conducive to the future development of such a valuable resource.</P>
      <P>This summer Ireland will enjoy the social and economic benefits of hosting a major international event.  Sporting organisations must encourage participation by a variety of people &mdash; young people, women, the disabled and those in disadvantaged areas.  The development of a sporting mentality among the young would contribute to curbing social problems.  This demands a huge amount of local ground work.  Organisations must be adequately assisted with and compensated for their work.  The importance of establishing a statutory sports council has been well recognised by the Government and work is well under way on drafting the sports council Bill.  We must ensure that the Bill adequately provides for a situation where we no longer expect that important work engaged in by voluntary sporting organisations will be continued by willing individuals at considerable personal cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently introduced the Minister to a group of people from Oldcastle, County Meath who are <Col N="541" /> trying to build a holiday, conference and recreation centre for the disabled.  This would be the only such centre in the country able to facilitate busloads of people and the Minister was very interested in the project.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to Claremont Stadium, Navan.  My colleague Deputy Dempsey, when Minister of State in a previous Government, secured funding for the project but the group has not been able to go ahead until now. The plan has been changed and they wish to move the running track from inside to outside.  I hope the Minister will be able to facilitate them in the near future.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to some other organisations, particularly those in the rural area of Cormeen, outside Moynalty.  A group of local people have put in an enormous voluntary effort to provide a magnificent sporting centre.  Next Saturday evening, one of my local football clubs is opening its pitch with the county team playing County Tyrone.  A number of people, young and old, have worked voluntarily to build up this football field and provide recreation facilities for people in that area.  The Opposition should await the Government Bill.  I appeal to the Minister not to forget the small sporting organisations and the marvellous work they do throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cooper-Flynn who, unfortunately, has left the House, raised an interesting point in regard to the masculine being used in the Bill.  Some years ago, a former colleague, Nuala Fennell, attempted to get the legislative drafting and language changed to include &ldquo;him&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo; but was informed that for legislative purposes &ldquo;him&rdquo; was deemed to include &ldquo;her&rdquo;.  I am pleased she raised that issue because it is unfinished business, in light of the fact that we have just concluded Second Stage of the Employment Equality Bill.  That is the area on which I intend to concentrate particularly since the Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, who is present, served as a member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Allen on his initiative in introducing the Bill which is the result of time, effort, knowledge and expertise gained when Minister of State.  I am sorry the Government has indicated it will not accept it but will introduce its own Bill and I urge it to do so urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report entitled Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland &mdash; Sport in Ireland 1997-2006 and beyond, by the strategy group set up by Deputy Allen when Minister of State is a tremendous base on which the Minister can work.  That the report has focused on Irish women in sport is welcome. Many tributes have been paid, and rightly <Col N="542" /> so, to Michelle Smyth, Catherina McKiernan and Sonia O'Sullivan.  On the world stage of athletics it is astonishing that Irish women dominate at this level.  Despite a lack of support and facilities for women in Ireland they have achieved much.  I commend the report for concentrating on the fact that women were under represented and unsupported with regard to participation in sport in Ireland, including lack of media coverage. Women have to win on an international stage before they are mentioned here.</P>
    <P>I recall attending a press conference when the women's basketball team won at international level.  The trainer said that if it had been the men's basketball team, the news would have dominated the headlines.  Instead it was given three lines at the bottom of the sports page.  This is a matter on which we will have to focus given that all the other areas such as health, education and so on have been addressed by Ministers.  I commend to the Minister the positive recommendations in the strategy group report on equal opportunities for women, including the recommendation that all organisations should adopt gender equity policies.  Future design and refurbishing of sporting facilities should take account of the needs of women.  When the Sports Council of Ireland is established it should have an equal number of men and women at executive and administrative levels.  The Minister has an opportunity to give a commitment in this area in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Flood. He made some sweeping comments and said that the Bill put forward by Deputy Allen was poorly drafted and so on.  At least the Bill has been presented.  Members on the Government side have said the Government Bill is imminent.  The Taoiseach said on 4 February that the Sports Council Bill would not be circulated this side of the summer.  If that is the case we could be debating this Bill next Christmas and we still would not have a sports council.  At least, Deputy Allen has shown initiative by bringing forward the Bill and has followed through on the recommendations made in the national plan.  Deputy Cooper-Flynn has scored an own goal by saying Deputy Allen was poaching ideas.  He was following through on recommendations in the national plan, the first of which was to set up a full Cabinet Minister for sport.  That was a good idea and was contained in the national plan.  While I have great respect for the Minister I am disappointed that nothing appears to have been done since the Department was set up.  Could it be that there is a tussle between the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and the Department of Education and Science?  When the Minister for Education and Science introduced the Education Bill there was no reference to sport and physical activity. This was a grave omission considering that the White Paper on Education devoted a full chapter to sport.  I feel sure there must be a power struggle <Col N="543" /> between the two Ministers.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin is getting all the headlines while the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation is disbursing the money. The indications are that we are heading for inflation, overheating and so on and the money may not last much longer.  Most of those on the far side who have contributed said they had spent money.  The Government was lucky to have had the funds but it has done nothing else.</P>
      <P>Two items of legislation were listed on the Government's legislative programme but there is no sign of them.  What has been happening for the past nine months?  We have a full Cabinet Minister who has done nothing except disburse money.  While Deputy Allen was Minister of State he achieved far more.  It is poor form and is not sporting of the Minister with responsibility for sport to reject this Bill.  If he had accepted the Bill on Second Stage, amendments could be proposed and debated.</P>
      <P>The Tour de France is coming here and will pass through my constituency of Cork East.  I pay tribute to the local groups on the hard work being done there.  Every town and village is working extremely hard to portray itself in the best light. I thank those who have worked to get the Tour de France here, Deputy Allen, Deputy Mitchell and others when in office.  By refusing to accept the Bill, the Government is not playing the game. The Minister was caught offside by Deputy Allen introducing this Bill.  The Minister should have introduced a Bill here months ago.  Let us hope his track record will improve and his Bill appears before the summer &mdash; the Taoiseach said it would not but perhaps we have managed to change his mind.</P>
      <P>Perhaps this Minister could consult the Minister, Deputy Martin, on the following matter which was raised by Deputy Allen last night.  It is dear to my heart and other Deputies mentioned it in passing.  Throughout the country school sports halls close on weekdays at 4 p.m., at weekends and for the whole summer, which is a terrible waste of resources.  These halls and schools should be made available to the public, to clubs and other organisations, especially in rural areas. They should be open every evening and weekend and throughout the summer.  Deputy Allen put forward a fantastic idea last evening.  I have long thought the same and I hope the Minister takes it on board.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Allen on bringing forward this Bill because at the very least it affords the House an opportunity to discuss sport.  I commend his vision in appointing Mr. John Treacy to draw up the national plan for sport, the first time such a thing has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our period in Government was a great time for sport.  Deputy Brady mentioned the arrival of the Tour de France in the summer, which is a result of the initiative of Deputy Kenny as Minister, as is well recognised.  Punchestown racecourse was <Col N="544" /> re-opened yesterday and the money for its renovation was provided by the last Government.  Last week the Minister, Deputy Walsh, opened a new facility in Listowel and acknowledged that we had provided the money.  Shelbourne Park, Mallow and several other facilities were attended to in our two and a half years in office.  I was the first to acknowledge that the Taoiseach gave £20 million to Croke Park &mdash; that is fine because we need to put money into sport.  Deputy Brady was not aware that during our term of office we provided substantial funding and had a good Minister for sport in Deputy Allen.  The current Minister is very interested in sport and is a former sporting hero himself &mdash; I will not call him a legend.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we have not seen him perform yet.  He has only been a year in office and we will judge him at the end of his term.  It may be unfair to judge him because he has set up a new Department which includes both sport and tourism &mdash; I do not know how comfortably they sit together.</P>
      <P>We await the report on drug testing and education in Irish sport, which is important for the credibility of the industry.  We also await the review of outdoor leisure activities, which play a crucial role in the tourism industry.  Walking holidays are more important to Ireland than golf holidays.  It is inexpensive to set up walks but highly expensive to build golf courses.  More people come to Ireland to walk than to play golf, so we need to get properly organised in that area.</P>
      <P>We also await the long promised independent statutory sports council, which Deputy Allen provides for in the Bill.  Given the level of legislation coming from the Minister's Department there is no reason for not bringing this proposal forward. I know this because I was involved in drafting legislation when I served in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>When I was Opposition spokesperson on youth and sport some years ago I carried out surveys on physical education in primary and post-primary schools.  I received responses from 1,500 primary schools and 600 post-primary schools.  At that time about 30 per cent of primary schools provided no physical education.  Another 20 per cent had some physical education.  It is children aged between 4 and 12 years who need it most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At leaving certificate level, only 40 per cent of school children had physical education.  Some years ago I advocated making physical education a leaving certificate subject but one cannot avoid acknowledging the major problem in the provision of physical education in post-primary schools.  It is one thing to make it an examination subject, but it should be provided to all students and that is not happening.  Physical education is being frozen out because of the points race, pressure of other academic subjects and pressure on space.  Parents are also pushing for more academic work and less physical education.  The <Col N="545" /> pilot programme for accreditation of physical education towards the leaving certificate is welcome but we should not forget that the provision of physical education in schools is declining at both primary and post-primary level.  This is a major worry which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton made a forceful point about facilities and I agree with him.  When the Minister is allocating money and is faced with various demands he can see duplication across the country. There is no reason for building a community hall one mile away from a primary school, as happened in my parish.  It is impossible for a teacher to walk children to the hall and back again &mdash; there are time considerations and if the weather is bad the children will get wet and may be open to colds or flu.  If the Minister sets up the sports council, as proposed here, there would be far more rationalisation of facilities and greater targeting of facilities where they are needed most. Community centres should be located as near as possible to existing schools so that they could be used during the day as well as at night.</P>
    <P>The core of this proposal is the need for a sports policy across the spectrum, dealing not only with elite athletes but also mass participation.  The Minister will have noted the declining standard of posture among children.  It is a pity that drill is no longer taught in schools.  We criticised it when it was done and when I was in physical education college in the seventies we were told that the emphasis was no longer on drill but on a major programme of physical education which looked at aesthetics and wider participation.  We now see overweight children with poor posture suffering from various disorders and our education system is doing nothing to correct it.  This should be part of a comprehensive physical education programme. I hope this Bill will force the Minister to act.  Although there may be a temptation to put legislation dealing with sport on the back burner and allow other legislation to take precedence, the Minister should put pressure on his officials and the parliamentary draftsman to produce the necessary legislation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le Fine Gael as ucht a gcuid ama a roinnt liom.  Ar dtús báire cuirim fáilte agus fiche roimh an Bille seo ón Teachta Bernard Allen agus le cúnamh Dé tiocfaidh Bille ón Rialtas gan mhoill muna bhfuil an Bille seo inghlactha acu agus is trua nach bhfuil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill credit must be given to the many clubs and organisations for the work done on a voluntary basis throughout the country. As I said to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs earlier today, a greater value should be put on this work by the State.  I hope the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, will take up the issue with his Cabinet colleagues.  People tend to <Col N="546" /> be regarded as idle unless they are in paid employment but nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to those involved in sporting organisations which rely heavily on voluntary effort.</P>
    <P>In funding sport the focus should be on safety. Many sporting organisations literally have to cut corners when it comes to using pitches with bad drainage to which ambulances cannot gain easy access.  Many parents have to travel long distances to pitches and it makes them less inclined to become involved.  This needs to be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Green Party is of the view that sport is closely linked with preventative measures in the health care area.  Without it, medical costs would be much higher than they are.  Why is it not better resourced?  The answer is simple.  Medical expenditure counts when it comes to gross domestic product and gross national product whereas the work done by sporting organisations does not, except when it comes to holding major events such as the Tour de France.</P>
    <P>There are many fine sporting organisations in Dublin North.  I will focus on one &mdash; Fingalians Athletic Club in Swords at which I had the pleasure of attending a presentation recently.  It is a large club with between 150 and 200 members covering all grades up to veterans who are inspired by the many people mentioned, including Catherina McKiernan, Sonia O'Sullivan, John Treacy, Eamon Coughlan not to mention local athletes Mags Greenan, top veteran long distance runner, and Garry Ryan, 200 metres Olympics participant.  They have to meet most of the considerable costs involved from their own resources. This prevents many athletes from reaching their full potential.</P>
    <P>John Carroll is a member of the club.  He has been a champion at 100 metres since he was eight years of age.  He is now 18.  He is the BLE 100 metres junior champion and 60 metres junior indoor champion.  In the senior indoor championships in Nenagh in February he finished second in the 60 metres.  He finished third at the distance in the Scottish junior championships.  He has his sights set on the Olympics.</P>
    <P>John Carroll has to meet his own equipment costs which are enormous.  For instance, he needs four pairs of runners each year which cost between £50 and £100 each, a pair of spikes which cost £150, a pair of training spikes which cost £70, not to mention tracksuits, T-shirts and all the other paraphernalia required.  He also has to meet his own travelling costs.  It should not be forgotten, therefore, when basking in the glory of our athletes, that many of them have had to undergo a hard, gruelling apprenticeship over many years from childhood.</P>
    <P>On eight occasions in January and February John Carroll travelled by train to Nenagh to compete in winter indoor events which entailed an overnight stay in bed and breakfast accommodation. <Col N="547" /> When he travelled to Glasgow on 31 January he had to pay his own air fare.  He could not afford to travel to Portugal for two weeks at Easter for warm weather training to prepare for the outdoor season.  In politics we are quick to take the credit.  We should not be slow to accept criticism when it comes to funding those who wish to reach their full potential, even if they will never make it to the Olympics.</P>
    <P>This year John Carroll will also travel to Cork, Tullamore, Kilkenny, Belfast and Britain on several occasions in preparation for the world junior championships to be held in the south of France in July.  This is a nerve-racking experience.  It will be his last opportunity to crown his junior career which has been well documented.  He has his sights set on participating in Sydney in the year 2000 and in a further two Olympic Games.  In relishing from our sitting rooms the sporting achievements of our sportsmen and women it should not be forgotten that their success has been achieved at huge financial and personal cost with the assistance of trainers and family members.  They instil a marvellous sense of pride.</P>
    <P>In considering legislation the Minister should strike the correct balance.  Athletes should be funded on the basis of their ability and commitment. Ultimately, we will all benefit.  The inspiration which that gives to up and coming athletes will pay dividends in their personal lives as well as for us all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Allen who began his contribution to this important debate by saying he was concerned I had not introduced the necessary proposals as speedily as he would wish, I will begin by being more positive.  I do not have time to discuss all the negative points raised but I commend the Deputies who participated in this debate.  We will see what we can do with the proposals which were made rather than acting negatively. Over the past two nights a great deal of goodwill has been demonstrated on the part of all Deputies who have shown a desire to get this area of sport right once and for all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen suggested I failed to publish a drug testing and education programme.  The issue of drug testing and education is a radical new departure in Irish sport and, as the Deputy knows, one which I made a priority during my first interview after taking office.  I could satisfy the Deputy's desire to introduce every new initiative yesterday but I do not believe the public, sports bodies, sports people and the other interested parties would thank me for doing so just for the sake of it.  I am sure Deputy Allen would be the first to criticise me if I did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my priorities has been to make progress in the area of anti doping.  I am glad to report that I have finalised my proposals for a national anti doping programme.  My proposals have been <Col N="548" /> circulated to other interested Departments for their views and I intend to bring the matter to Government very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen stated he realised sport was not attracting adequate Exchequer or national lottery funding.  I agree but the gains made have been since this area was brought to Cabinet by the Taoiseach for the first time in our history.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stanton said there was a slowness in bringing proposals to Government.  I will explain to the Deputy how it works.  On the day the anti-doping programme was published Deputy Allen called a press conference.  On the day I brought the heads of a Bill to the Government he called another press conference.</P>

      <P>When one brings the heads of a Bill to Government one must circulate all the other Departments for their views.  As we are wasting good Fine Gael time in this House, my Bill is being circulated in the Departments so they can give their views on it.  Perhaps the Deputy might convey that to his parliamentary party. That is how it works.  The Bill will be published very shortly.  I assure Members I do not intend to make a political issue out of this matter because it is far too important.  We intend to go forward with, I hope, the co-operation of all Deputies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barnes referred to the position of women, which is a very relevant point.  Last January, for the first time, I held a meeting in Dublin Castle with all the national governing bodies and asked them to bring forward their strategies for sport.  I told them that no funding would be available unless they concentrated on four areas &mdash; youth, disadvantaged areas, the disabled and women.  I have been able to increase the funding for the national governing bodies by 46 per cent this year.  I am still waiting for the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI to bring forward their proposals. They are big enough to continue with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;their everyday running of the sport.  When the council is being elected I am sure Deputy Barnes will be vociferous on the issue of women and I will support her in ensuring that is carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a reference to funding.  Health received £3.1 million from the lottery.  Every penny of that is necessary but there is a point where we must call a halt.  In the past five years successive Governments have increased the <Col N="549" /> health budget by £1 billion.  I am a doctor and it is as if doctors, prison officers, the Judiciary, the Garda and social workers are clearing up the mess in a basement in which a tap is running into an overflowing sink.  We should examine this situation. We could do a great deal in sport with 1 per cent of that £1 billion.  As many Deputies said, we could probably do a great deal in the area of prevention, thereby reducing the need for expenditure on health.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of interesting points. I assure them I will be as co-operative as possible in this area and I hope they will co-operate with me.  We should examine the areas of funding, youth and the disabled.  This is a very interesting debate.  The Taoiseach did not say we would bring it in in October because I wanted to circulate the heads of the Bill.  I am now able to say to Deputies that a sports Bill will be produced in the next number of weeks.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Allen on introducing this Bill, into which I know he put a great deal of research.  He has the benefit of a great deal of interest and experience in this area. He was very innovative when he was the Minister of State with responsibility for youth and sport.</P>
      <P>I was very interested to see the Minister has suspended any further applications for national lottery funding from 11 February on the basis that a review is necessary.  I agree and I am sure when he quantified the cost of funding the amount of applications currently on file he realised he would never reach the end of that list, regardless of how much funding was provided.</P>
      <P>The provision of national lottery funding for recreation and sport must be evaluated on the basis of value for money.  I have seen the joy of people receiving £5,000, £10,000 or £20,000 to renovate a community centre or sports club.  The spurt in the development of these recreational amenities probably began when the national lottery was founded in March 1987.  There was great momentum at that time and many big community centres were opened.  However, the Department must take an interest, not just in allocating the funding but in assessing the realism of demands made by communities because some plans in the past were over ambitious.  It is now impossible to sustain and maintain many of the complexes which were built at that time.  It is important for communities to build centres which they will be able to manage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will have noticed that the Leader programme and urban and village renewal programmes have revived communities.  Communities decide to build heritage centres or museums <Col N="550" /> but they often do not consider how they will sustain and market such facilities and keep them open for more than an hour a week.  These questions must be asked.</P>
    <P>In 1997 the national lottery funds had a surplus of £107 million, which was divided out.  The Minister referred to the health budget.  Some £31 million of that surplus went to health, which might otherwise have been provided by the Exchequer. With regard to sports, recreation and amenities, it is necessary to analyse the way national lottery funding is divided in parallel with the analysis undertaken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was Minister for Tourism and Trade he discreetly established independent evaluation committees to examine projects for different areas.  However, I encountered an injustice with regard to the adoption of different criteria by these committees depending on what part of the country they worked.  Newcastlewest Golf Club, which spent a large amount of money developing an 18 hole golf club, made a submission for funding for £75,000 for a lovely golf clubhouse, which, in the overall context of its expenditure, was a small sum.  While the evaluation committee considered the matter several times it could never give approval, yet similar committees operating in other parts of the country which did not have embargoes against golf clubs allocated grants to them.  It did not make me too popular a public representative to be reminded of this.  I advised that the midwest review committee, which evaluated such projects in my area rejected the submission because certain people made it known that golf clubs were not to be supported.</P>
    <P>There must be uniformity between valuation committees which are independent of the Minister and which operate on the same basis as those under the former Ministers for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Kenny. Otherwise they will discriminate in different parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to this debate.  This Bill is a product of the national plan for sport, which was published in February 1997.  In that respect, some Members on the opposite side of the House have attempted to rewrite history.  The plan originated from the 400 submissions and the numerous public meetings held throughout the country.  All the parties in the House were consulted on the plan; it was a product of the people as well as the political system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris welcomed the Bill but had two major reservations.  He said it did not mention disabled sportspersons or the special Olympics. The national plan for sport makes clear that the idea of involving people with disability and those involved in the special Olympics is to integrate them into the mainstream of sport.  To define <Col N="551" /> them in the Bill would have done the opposite. That is why they were not specified.  People with disabilities and those involved in the special Olympics are as much involved in the mainstream sporting system as others.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for sport, I appointed representatives to all of the major groups, including the group who formulated the national plan and the Sports Council of Ireland.  I hope the Deputy's fears are allayed by this.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also expressed fears about the code of ethics in sport.  The NCTC in Limerick is the body driving the implementation of the code by incorporating it in the coaching system that is now being offered to every club and organisation. Approximately several thousand coaches at different levels are trained every year by the centre. The curriculum also incorporates the code.  I hope it will not only protect children but also the volunteers and the spirit of volunteerism that is so strong in sport.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke for five minutes in a three hour debate and said he wanted to be positive. His junior Minister, the Minster of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, made a very negative speech last night.  He criticised the Bill for being badly drafted and unbalanced.  I understood he was reading the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Any legislation I announced as Minister of State was long planned.  People would be foolish to assume that, with a press conference in Cork on Tuesday morning, the Minister would suddenly make a statement on Monday night about the Government's involvement with the heads of a Bill.  If the Minister is so advanced where is the legislation?</P>

      <P>The Minister said there was too much money going to health.  What about the old and the sick who cannot get hospital beds?  What about the trolleys which are still in use in hospital corridors? He should not offer us money from that quarter.</P>

      <P>Last night I criticised the Minister for his indecisiveness since taking office.  He has failed to produce a drug testing programme, despite the establishment of an expert committee in May 1997 which reported to him last December and despite his army of civil servants.

The leading sportspersons of Ireland, at national and international level, are badly compromised because of the absence of a drugs testing programme here.  It is essential that the Minister immediately implements such a programme. Everything is in place to do this.  When I was Minister for State we had discussions with the Northern Ireland sports council who had the experience and expertise to implement a drugs testing programme immediately.  We also had an arrangement and understanding with the credited Olympic laboratory in Chelsea to analyse the samples taken from our athletes.  Yet, despite the Minister's promises on his first day in office that he would be world leader in taking blood samples from our athletes and that he would show the world how it would be done, nothing has happened so far.  We are in breach of the EU convention and have been compromised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are more than 20 months until the beginning of the third Christian millennium. There is considerable excitement and interest in many other countries, particularly Britain, about this event and many major projects have been planned.  We have seen pictures and media coverage of the millennium dome in Britain which the Minister Mr. Mandelson is charged with constructing in London.  Many other exhibitions and special projects are planned in France, other EU countries and the United States.  However, it appears the importance and significance of the millennium is by-passing the Government.  There is a significant possibility that the Government will not be in office when the millennium is celebrated and perhaps that is why it is not bothering to prepare for it.  Nevertheless, the Government's performance on this matter has been dismal.</P>
      <P>Dublin City Council recently discussed a number of significant projects for the city which were to be prepared and initiated to mark the millennium, particularly the O'Connell Street boulevard project.  Some interesting designs on the restoration of the street as a major central area in the capital city similar to the Champs Elysées have been submitted.  There is also a proposal for a new bridge over the river Liffey and the announcement of a possible new competition and several regional plans.  However, most city and county councillors and Deputies are unaware of what is happening because the Taoiseach and the Government appear to be unsure about what projects will go ahead.  Last October-November on a number of occasions on the Order of Business I raised with the Taoiseach the possibility of considering, if not a large project or a number of large projects, a simple project for our capital city and other urban areas.  I asked that consideration be given to setting up a special environmental millennium fund, given that most city dwellers love parks and open spaces.  As a result of my suggestion, the Taoiseach's office contacted Dublin Corporation and a list of projects was drawn up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there are a number of significant parks such as Belcamp Park, Streamville Park and Fr. Collins Park where major environmental works are needed.  When the Taoiseach was leader of Dublin City Council in 1987 he abolished service charges but cut the workforce by 1,500.  He also cut back significantly on spending. <Col N="556" /> Since then the council has had to cope with a threadbare parks budget.  Will the Taoiseach support my proposal and make available money for parks and open spaces for our capital city?</P>
    <P>A number of major announcements have been made for the city such as the Luas proposal.  It looks as if in the Dublin Cabinet Ministers, led by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, because of opposition by their country colleagues, are not prepared to spend £2 when they can get away with spending £1 in terms of providing the best possible environmentally friendly transport infrastructure for Dublin.  There are a number of key projects throughout the city such as the village project in Darndale.  The Taoiseach has been able to provide money for that special millennium project. There are ten or 15 other areas around the city and in other cities where an impact could be made in terms of providing for memorable celebrations of the millennium.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDaid, recently announced spending on sports, but most people in this House were bitterly disappointed with the allocation.  It was thought the Government intended to target sports and youth resources at specially deprived areas, yet my constituency with many deprived areas received the miserly sum of £4,000 out of a total of £7 million.  Is the Taoiseach serious about the promises made in the election manifesto?  As part of the millennium celebrations significant projects should be considered such as the development of parks, the boulevard scheme and so on.  Those projects should be expedited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.  I will bring his comments, particularly the latter ones, to the Taoiseach's attention.  The millennium will probably be one of the biggest events worldwide in our lifetime and it will be spoken about and looked back on by future generations.  It is an occasion which has already captured the public's attention and will gain momentum as we approach the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, has appointed a millennium festival committee.  This committee, chaired by Mr. Derek Keogh, will implement Ireland's millennium festivals project.  This will further develop and link together existing festivals and events around the country to provide a &ldquo;festival of festivals&rdquo;.  The idea is to link participating festivals into a prolonged celebration which will be accessible to all sectors of society, attractive and welcoming to visitors and utilise existing infrastructure and expertise around the country.</P>
      <P>Given that St. Patrick's Day falls earlier in the year than most other national days, the Minister has decided that our millennium celebrations will be launched on St. Patrick's Day 1999 &mdash; in other words the world's first millennium party will start in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> The Deputy will be aware that a very large number of different projects, initiatives and events have been proposed as elements of a programme to commemorate the new millennium. Some of these are specific millennium projects while others of a more general nature have been suggested as suitable for inclusion.  There are projects relating to sport, arts and culture, the environment, heritage, social issues, tourism, information technology and education.  It is clear that there is no shortage of ideas on how we can commemorate the millennium.  Many groups and organisations will proceed with their own plans without Government intervention.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable publicity about the plans for millennium celebrations in the UK and other countries.  The proposal for a millennium dome in London has attracted considerable international attention.  We should not, however, attempt to imitate any other country's proposals, but instead proceed on the basis that suitable and appropriate projects are selected.</P>
    <P>Proposals for a comprehensive programme to commemorate the millennium in Ireland are currently being developed.  These will be submitted to the Government in the near future.  While I cannot disclose the proposals in advance of a Government decision on the matter, it can be anticipated that it will include the appointment of a millennium committee to oversee the commemoration programme and consider possible projects which might be included.  It is envisaged that the Government will be involved in co-ordinating a limited number of projects at national level, while also ensuring that people at locations around the country have an opportunity to participate in the commemorations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance said in his budget speech last December that he will consider the possibility of some future contribution to the funding of suitable millennium projects.  While it may be possible for the Government to fund or partially fund some of these events, it would be wrong to create unjustified expectations which cannot be met.  The Government will seek to participate in and support a limited number of projects and it will fall to the proposed committee to make recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals which has been put forward as a millennium project is the O'Connell Street integrated area plan.  This is one of several millennium projects being developed by Dublin Corporation.  As the Deputy is aware, this involves extensive plans for the rejuvenation of the entire O'Connell Street area.  The Taoiseach has already indicated that he believes this is a good initiative and it is important that we can be proud of the country's primary thoroughfare. This project, along with any others proposed by Dublin Corporation, will clearly be considered by the millennium committee when it is established shortly.</P>
    <P>I reassure the Deputy the Government is conscious of the short timescale involved and of the need for effective action within this timeframe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" /> I am confident we will put in place an appropriate and comprehensive programme for the commemoration of the millennium, which will provide an opportunity for ordinary members of the public, both in Dublin and around the country, to fully participate in and enjoy the arrival of the new millennium.  At the same time, we are determined to support practical projects which will leave a lasting inheritance for the citizens of the new millennium by improving the facilities and opportunities available to them.  It is in that practical way we will approach the commemoration of the millennium rather than in a grandiose manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply.  Everybody has been aware in recent years of the horrendous civil war that took place in Rwanda.  We saw on television and read in the papers of the atrocities there.  After such a trauma, there comes a time for reflection and for justice to be done.  Many things require judgment and correction afterwards.</P>
      <P>In the past week or so people were publicly executed in Rwanda.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs to intercede with the authorities in Rwanda and, more importantly, with her colleagues in the other European Union member states to ensure that where direct aid is made available to a government, it is not used <i>carte blanche.</i>  Aid to NGOs and other voluntary organisations is acceptable, but it would be unacceptable for direct aid to continue in the aftermath of what happened last week.  According to reports, the executions of recent times will be repeated and could continue for weeks, months or years.  That will do nothing to recover the ground lost in the course of the civil war or rehabilitate people's thinking on the bitterness that existed between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Many people seem to have forgotten that one of the causes of the tragedy was a particular radio station which continuously pumped out vitriolic information and propaganda which precipitated the catastrophe.  That needs to be taken into account.  Will the Minister of State seriously consider intervening or withdrawing any direct aid which might be proposed for that area until the authorities there recognise that pursuing a policy of the nature indicated by the public executions last week is foolhardy?  Will she keep in mind the worldwide revulsion at the executions long before they took place and recognise that this could continue on an intermittent basis over the next couple of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I implore the Minister of State to take action in this area and recognise that continued support might be seen as an indication of approval for the executions.  Obviously, there will be retribution <Col N="559" /> and sentences will be passed.  However, as a country which has long since abolished the death penalty with all EU member states, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has a responsibility to ensure the authorities in Rwanda clearly receive this message.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government shares the concern expressed by Deputy Durkan about the executions of 22 persons convicted of genocide in Rwanda which took place on 24 April. Our views were expressed directly to the Rwandan Ambassador to Ireland on 22 April when he made an official visit to Dublin.  He was asked to convey these concerns to his Government.  In addition, on the same day the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had an opportunity to express its views to the Rwandan Ambassador.  The day before the executions, my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, issued a statement urging the Government of Rwanda to exercise the utmost restraint as regards the imposition of the death penalty, with a view to its abolition.  He expressed concern that the carrying out in public of these executions would not help the process of restoring peace.</P>
      <P>In addition to these bilateral efforts, the British Presidency in Kigali made demarches along similar lines on behalf of the European Union to the authorities in Rwanda on 4 April and again on 23 April, the day before the executions.  The European Union also encouraged the Government of Rwanda to comply fully with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to observe other international safeguards. When the executions went ahead the following day, the EU Presidency issued an immediate statement recalling the Union's appeal for a stay of execution and expressing its dismay.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that the Government will continue to seek every appropriate opportunity, at bilateral and multilateral levels, to minimise the use of capital punishment in response to genocide in the Great Lakes region.  Indeed, one of the avenues which can be followed was discussed this morning during consideration of the Bill on the International Criminal Tribunals.  The International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda, based in Arusha, does not impose the death penalty and the Government will continue to support efforts to improve its effectiveness as a means to deal with those accused of genocide.</P>
      <P>However, only 35 people have been indicted by the International Tribunal so far and four trials are ongoing.  In contrast, approximately 120,000 people accused of being involved in the genocide are held in extremely poor and inhumane conditions in prisons and communal lockups throughout Rwanda.  Deputies will recall that between 500,000 and 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in 1994 in a genocide orchestrated by the authorities then in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> This was the latest tragedy in a cycle of violence which witnessed massacres and massive displacement of people since the late 1950s.  In parallel with this cycle of violence, a cycle of impunity and a culture of fear developed in which the guilty went unpunished.  The Arusha tribunal and the Government of Rwanda, through its national system of justice, are trying to break this cycle.  It is acknowledged by all who take an interest in the future of the Rwandan people that this is one of the key issues which has to be addressed if national reconciliation is ever to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In the immediate aftermath of the genocide, up to two million Hutus, including many members of the army and militia groups, fled to neighbouring countries and lived in camps along the border. Deputies will recall the massive return of refugees in 1996 when the camps were attacked during the war in Zaire and over one million people crossed back into Rwanda.  The Rwandan Government is faced with the reintegration of these returned refugees into devastated communities which witnessed and survived genocide. In addition, security, particularly in the north west, is worsening because of extremist attacks. Continuous heavy rains since last October have led to a serious food shortage and outbreaks of malaria and waterborne diseases, thus exacerbating all the existing problems.</P>
    <P>In this context should we and our partners in the European Union provide direct aid to Rwanda in the wake of the executions?  The humanitarian needs of the people of Rwanda still exist.  The provision of basic needs such as shelter, water and sanitation and basic health care remains a major challenge.  Even before the catastrophic events of the last few years Rwanda was one of the poorest countries in Africa and could not survive without massive international assistance. We should continue to provide humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance to the Rwandan people.  We cannot abandon them now.</P>
    <P>The overall objective of Ireland's programme of support to Rwanda, which amounted to £2.3 million in 1997, is twofold, first, to respond effectively to the basic humanitarian needs of the people and, secondly, to provide rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance in a way that is inclusive and contributes towards reconciliation and the establishment of conditions which will lead to permanent peace and stability.</P>
    <P>This assistance is channelled through Irish NGOs, such as Concern and TRÓCAIRE, to support programmes such as caring for unaccompanied children, trauma counselling for survivors of genocide, feeding prisoners and the provision of shelter, through international agencies such as the UN Development Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross and a small proportion directly to the Government of Rwanda to assist it in institution building, in the training of health care workers and communal police.  It should be noted that there has been a noticeable decrease in human rights abuses in <Col N="561" /> those communes where police have received proper training.</P>
    <P>Meeting the basic needs of genocide survivors, returned refugees and prisoners and their families is not enough.  The very fabric of Rwandan society must be rebuilt in a way that breaks the cycle of violence and impunity, if real reconciliation and sustainable development is to be achieved.  The rehabilitation of the justice sector, which was destroyed in the genocide and its aftermath of civil war, is crucial to the future of Rwanda.  Ireland, in concert with other donor countries, such as Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK has supported, and will continue to support, efforts to rebuild and strengthen the administration of justice.  This will help put in place the necessary infrastructure to ensure that due process is followed in all genocide cases.  It will have a positive effect in the broader context.  We are all too aware of the importance of a properly functioning system of justice, which has the confidence of all citizens, to the development of a democratic society.  We also support the development of a strong civil society as a necessary counterbalancing force.</P>
    <P>A recent monitoring visit by officials of my Department confirmed that the assistance provided so far is meeting its intended targets.  It is the Government's intention to continue to contribute humanitarian and rehabilitation assistance to vulnerable people and communities and to work with other Governments and members of the international community to build a peaceful and stable society which offers hope for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  It arises from a report on RTE today that 155 files, which were the subject of a discovery order from the Moriarty Tribunal, have gone missing from the Department of Finance, that the files related to the operation of exchange controls, that the Department refused to answer questions on this matter which were posed by RTE and that the Department failed to inform the Moriarty Tribunal that the files were missing. The Minister for Finance issued a statement this afternoon which confirmed the story but which gave little further information except that 167 files, not 155, are missing.  I would have preferred this matter to have been taken by way of a Private Notice Question because I would have had the opportunity to pose supplementary questions. However, I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me.  The statement by the Minister for Finance this afternoon sought to diminish the importance of the missing files by claiming that the bulk of them were from prior to 1970.  I do not believe this diminishes the importance of the work of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 1 March 1998 refers to the discovery order by the Moriarty tribunal covering the years from 1954 to 1992.  It points <Col N="562" /> out that when sterling was devalued on Saturday, 18 November 1967, Mr. Haughey, as Minister for Finance, was informed in advance of the devaluation by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Jim Callaghan.  The telegram from the Chancellor to Mr. Haughey is dated 17 November 1967.  Sterling was devalued by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Tribune</i> story links the order for discovery from the Moriarty tribunal with the intention of the tribunal to investigate whether Mr. Haughey or any of his friends could have benefited from this advance knowledge by buying foreign currency before the devaluation and selling it after the devaluation at a profit of approximately 14 per cent.  Any person buying foreign currency in 1967 needed to lodge an application under the existing exchange controls.  Copies of the application would be on file either in the Central Bank or in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Against this background, it is not sufficient for the Minister for Finance to dismiss today's revelations as merely a matter covering dusty 30 year old files of irrelevant antiquity.  If the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> story is correct, the files from 1967 are very relevant to the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State inform us how many of the files, out of the 167 missing files, came from 1967 and, in particular, can he state how many of the missing files date from the fourth quarter of that year?  In material I have circulated I have attached a copy of the front page portion of the newspaper article of 1 March.  For the benefit of the House there is a two page spread on pages 8 and 9 which goes into greater detail on the matter. In the text of the article, Mr. Haughey forcefully denied any impropriety on his part in respect of the matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State is in a position to answer some other questions.  The answers may be in his briefing material.  When was the Minister for Finance informed that a large number of files were missing?  Did he inform the Moriarty tribunal of the problem at any stage over the past three months?  Why did the Minister for Finance not take advantage of the several opportunities he had in this House when the Moriarty tribunal was debated or was the subject of parliamentary questions to inform the House the files were missing? Are the files simply misplaced or have they been destroyed?  Can the Minister of State give an assurance to the House that none of these files has been removed from the Department of Finance by persons known or unknown?  Can he assure the House that no attempt is being made by persons known or unknown to obstruct the Moriarty tribunal?</P>
    <P>Have the terms of the Archives Act been implemented in respect of the files of long duration? I would have thought that since the implementation of the Archives Act there was an obligation on the Department of Finance to forward material of this kind to the archives office if it was older than 30 years and, if it was of a more recent vintage, to look after the files appropriately <Col N="563" /> to see if they contain information which would be lodged in the archives office.</P>
    <P>Is the information which was contained in these files from 1965 when exchange control was transferred from the Department of Finance to the Central Bank?  Are copies available in the Central Bank?  If RTE had not made this issue public today, had the Minister any intention of informing the Houses of the Oireachtas, or did he intend keeping both the Dáil and the Moriarty tribunal in the dark about the missing files?</P>
    <P>Did the Minister inform the Taoiseach and the Cabinet that the files were missing?  In this afternoon's statement the Minister said his Department was at the full disposal of the tribunal to assist it in whatever way it can in relation to the files which have been located.  How can the Department assist the tribunal in relation to files it cannot find?  Has the Minister taken legal advice on the missing files and, if so, will the Minister of State communicate to the House the nature of that legal advice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I will endeavour to answer all the questions as best I can.  I have included backup material in the script.  I wanted to include as much as was available to me so that it would be fully available to the House.</P>
      <P>On 16 December 1997 the Tribunal of Inquiry (Payments to Messrs.  Charles Haughey and Michael Lowry) served an order of production on the Minister for Finance relating to documents pertaining to the operation of exchange controls in the years 1954 to 1993, inclusive.  The Central Bank was delegated responsibility for the day-to-day operation of exchange controls with effect from 3 May 1965.  I would draw Deputies' attention to the fact that the order did not specify any particular file or document and required that all documents be located.</P>
      <P>When the order for production was received, the Minister immediately wrote to the Governor and authorised the Central Bank to take all the steps necessary to comply with the order.  The Minister also directed the Department of Finance to ensure that all relevant documents would be produced and that every assistance would be given to the tribunal.  The process followed by the Department in relation to the production order was one which was adopted, in consultation with legal advice, with a view to offering the maximum assistance to the tribunal.  Senior officials of the Department took charge of the search process and asked the heads of all units in the Department to carry out a thorough search of all offices, storage areas, etc., to ensure that all the relevant files were located.  This included a search of buildings previously occupied by sections of the Department of Finance.  The senior officials also wrote to the Central Bank requesting that a similar search be undertaken by the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very large number of files were identified by <Col N="564" /> the Department as coming under the scope of the production order; by reference to the file register, 713 files have been identified.  Some of these files would consist of several volumes, that is to say, continuation parts of the original file.  In addition, 24 folders and 34 individual documents were identified and located.  However, despite the most strenuous efforts on the part of the Department, it has not been possible to locate some of the registered files relating to the operation of exchange controls for the period in question.</P>
    <P>The Department was operating on the basis that the tribunal would seek access to the files covered by the production order when it was appropriate for it to do so.  The Department was meanwhile making every effort to locate all the relevant files.  This search is continuing.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister issued his press statement earlier today the continued search has resulted in the location of a small number of files and, by reference to the register of files, the present situation is that 139 files have not been located and, in the case of a further 12 registered files, 14 volumes have not been located.  The vast bulk of these files were originally registered before 1970 and of these the large majority were originally registered before 1960.  Of the 139 files, 111 were originally registered between 1954 and 1959, 13 were originally registered between 1960 and 1964 and four were originally registered between 1965 and 1970.  In the case of the further 12 files I referred to, four were originally registered between 1954 and 1959.  One was originally registered between 1960 and 1964 and one was originally registered between 1965 and 1970.  The possibility that some files may have been amalgamated over the years without this being recorded in the file register is still being investigated.  The titles of the files not located relate to various aspects of the operation of exchange controls, including trade-related matters.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to say that, subject to legal advice and to the agreement of the tribunal he has no objection, in principle, to a listing of the files which have not been located being made available to the House.  It is the Minister's intention to send to the tribunal tomorrow the list of all the files covered by the production order, including a list of the files that cannot be located, and to consult with his legal advisers.</P>
    <P>The efforts by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and by the Department of Finance, were directed at facilitating the work of the tribunal and giving every assistance to it.  There is no question of the Minister or the Department of Finance seeking in any way to deny access by the tribunal or obstruct its work.  The very opposite was and still is the intention.  The files that have been located have been and still are available to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Department is at the full disposal of the tribunal to assist it in whatever way it can in relation to the files which have not been located.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 April 1998. <Col N="565" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 25, 28, 33, 39 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free TV licence are available to people, living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a <Col N="566" /> welfare type payment, and who are living alone or with specified excepted people.  They are also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions.  In addition, widows or widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, as well as to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions.  In addition, widows or widowers, between the ages of 60 to 65, whose late spouses had entitlement to free travel retain that entitlement.</P>
    <P>The national fuel scheme is available to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments, who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  This includes those who are in receipt of blind pension, disability allowance, invalidity pension, and infectious diseases maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>Free travel companion passes have been available since 1990 to persons who qualify for free travel and who, because of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  The free travel companion pass enables a person 16 years of age, or over, to accompany the pass holder free of charge.</P>
    <P>Currently, the companion passes are available to the following main groups: recipients of blind person's pension and all blind people who are registered with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland or with the National League of the Blind of Ireland; recipients of disability allowance who are medically certified that they are unfit to travel alone; recipients of invalidity pension who are medically certified that they are permanently wheelchair bound; and persons receiving care from a carer in receipt of a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>The last budget provides for two major extensions to the free travel scheme.  The first provides for a free companion travel pass for everyone aged 75 years or over who is medically certified as being unfit to travel alone. The second change entitles all carers in receipt of a carer's allowance to a free travel pass in their own right.  These measures will come into effect in September.</P>
    <P>An additional change announced in the budget allows for people who are in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension who transfer to certain other social welfare pensions (for example, widow's and widower's contributory pensions) to retain their entitlement to the free schemes.  This measure extends the current arrangement which allows only for invalidity pensioners who transfer either to retirement pension at age 65 or to widow's or widower's contributory pension at age 60 or over, to retain their free schemes.  The free schemes are reviewed each year in a budgetary context and the proposals raised by the Deputies, all of which have expenditure implications, will be examined in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="567" /> The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people who were living alone.  However, over the years, these schemes have been developed and extended and this has led to increasing pressure for further extensions. As a result, the qualifying conditions are becoming increasingly complex which makes them difficult to understand and to administer.  It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner. The review will be carried out by the Department in co-operation with The Policy Institute, Trinity College, Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuable role which is played by home helps in the overall care of older people in this country is widely recognised. As the Deputy will be aware, the home help service is operated by the health boards who come under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children.  His Department has arranged to have an examination of the home-help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, to advise on how the services can be developed in a cost-effective way in tandem with the other community based services. I understand that this review is expected to be completed by early summer.  The Minister for Health and Children will, on receipt of the report, give consideration to how best to bring about improvements on the overall organisation and development of the home help service.</P>
      <P>In so far as entitlement to social welfare payments is concerned, the position is that any income deriving from participation in the home help service is not in general taken into account for the purposes of determining entitlement to means-tested social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further issue, however, relates to the position of people who, by virtue of being engaged as home helps, are deemed to be unavailable for work and thus have no entitlement to claim unemployment assistance in respect of any day in which they undertake such work.  However, the introduction of any change in the existing statutory provisions in this regard would not be straightforward.  Apart from the direct costs involved, any proposals along those lines would have to have regard to the position of other similar types of employment. <Col N="568" /></P>

      <P>The self employed were brought into Social Insurance from April 1988.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a widow's or widower's (contributory) pension a person's full insurance record or the record over the previous three or five years is used to satisfy the yearly average condition.  Also a widow or widower can qualify on his or her own or late spouse's record.  The specific conditions are as follows: (a) There must be at least 156 weeks PRSI paid and if at pension age or date of death of spouse (whichever is the earlier) four years or longer have elapsed since entry into insurance, either (b) (i) an average of 39 weeks PRSI paid or credited over the three to five tax years before reaching pension age or before the spouse died, if earlier; or (ii) for a minimum pension, a yearly average of at least 24 weeks' PRSI paid or credited since starting work, up to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age or before the spouse died.  If condition (b) (ii) is used to qualify for benefit, a person would need a yearly average of 48 weeks PRSI, since first starting work, to receive the maximum rate of pension.</P>
      <P>These qualification conditions are less onerous than those pertaining to other pensions reflecting the different nature of the payment.  Only contributions due up to the date of death can be taken into account in establishing pension entitlement.</P>
      <P>All widowed persons not entitled to a contributory pension can apply for a non-contributory pension which of course is subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will have this investigated if he sends me the details.</P>

      <P>This Government has pledged itself to achieving a society based on social inclusion, and to addressing the structural causes of poverty as it affects a significant minority in our society.  This is reflected in the Government programme An Action Programme for the Millennium.  A key element to achieving <Col N="569" /> this is the national anti-poverty strategy which has been in place for just over one year.</P>
      <P>The initial focus of the strategy has been on putting in place appropriate institutional and administrative structures to ensure that the implementation of the NAPS was supplemented by efficient and complementary mechanisms. These included the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion and drugs, including local development, chaired by the Taoiseach, which now meets on a regular monthly basis; the continuation of the NAPS interdepartmental policy committee, comprised of senior officers who have responsibility for ensuring that the NAPS provisions relevant to their Departments are implemented; the NAPS unit based in my Department which co-ordinates the implementation of the strategy; the appointment of NAPS liaison officers in relevant Government Departments to fulfil a communication and co-ordination role.</P>
      <P>The primary focus of the first year of the NAPS was to have the concept of social inclusion firmly embedded across the Civil Service.  I am satisfied that this has been achieved due, to a great extent, to the existence of these structures which facilitate co-operation in relation to social inclusion issues at all levels.  As a result, Departments are responding to the challenge to develop new and more open ways of developing their policies.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet subcommittee reviews the strategies which are in place to deal with poverty and exclusion and provides strong leadership for the strategy.  Much progress has been made in this first year in moving towards the targets set out in the NAPS statement.  Indeed, it is now envisaged that many of these targets will be reached sooner than anticipated.</P>
      <P>Some examples of positive, concrete initiatives which are making inroads on the NAPS targets in its five key thematic areas are a multi-annual employment plan has been put in place aimed at reducing unemployment and preventing young people from drifting into unemployment; a variety of new measures have been introduced to tackle early school leaving; social welfare payment rates have been increased so that 94 per cent of all social welfare claimants will be over the rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare; rural poverty is being addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on Rural Development; a new integrated services project has been introduced to co-ordinate services in a number of particularly disadvantaged urban areas, and the national drugs strategy has been progressed.</P>
      <P>At departmental level, NAPS baseline documents and 1998 workplans have been prepared by the relevant Departments.  These documents will provide a broad indication of where current programmes and initiatives are impacting on poverty, and will facilitate identification of potential cross-cutting actions which could prevent duplication and provide more focused action to promote social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> Recognising the need for greater awareness of the NAPS and the causes and realities of poverty in general, a public information and education strategy has been developed and implementation will begin shortly.  Work is also continuing on the preparation of guidelines for proofing Government policies for their impact on poverty.  Consultation will take place soon with the social partners on a discussion document to progress this issue, which will be an important element in ensuring that future substantive relevant Government policies support social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Finally, an interdepartmental working group is currently examining the feasibility of establishing a community trust to support voluntary and community activity and to promote social inclusion. The involvement of the business sector in this initiative is extremely important and I hope to see some progress on this in the near future.</P>

      <P>There are currently 60,845 lone parents in receipt of one parent family payment.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to one parent family payment is based on the household income of the lone parent and under the means test, the first £6,000 of a lone parent's annual earnings are disregarded from the assessment, while only half of any earnings between £6,000 and £12,000 are assessed. The purpose of applying such an earnings disregard is to facilitate and support lone parents in making the transition to employment.  Given that it has only been in operation since the introduction of the one parent family payment in January 1997, I do not propose making any changes to the means test for one parent family payment at present.  However, my Department will continue to keep the situation under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to further education, lone parents over 21 years of age and in receipt of the one parent family payment for at least six months are eligible for my Department's back to education allowance where they wish to pursue approved full-time second level or third level education courses.  This new allowance which replaced the former second level allowance and third level allowance is paid at a standard rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the one parent family payment in the case of lone parents, is payable for the full duration of the course, including all holiday periods, and is not means tested so that lone parents may work without affecting their payment.  In addition to the weekly payment, an annual cost of education allowance is payable <Col N="571" /> which from September next is being increased to £150.  Lone parents are also eligible for the vocational training opportunities scheme which is administered by the Department of Education and Science through vocational education committees around the country.</P>
    <P>Child-care is an issue for all parents and is currently being examined by an expert group chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This group's report will be of assistance to the Government in formulating future policy in this area, as will the report of the Commission on the Family which I received today.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the findings of the most recent report of the European Observatory on National Family Policies that, despite recent improvements, Ireland's child benefit package was still below the European mean; if, in view of these findings, he will agree to substantial increases in child benefit in the next budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the European Observatory on National Family Policies referred to by the Deputy was published in October 1997 and refers to the situation in 1996. The report examines the contribution of public policy, including taxation and social welfare measures, to the cost of a child in the cases of couples or lone parents in employment.  The report does not, therefore, take into account the arrangements in social insurance or social assistance schemes to support, for instance, dependent children of people who are unemployed.</P>
      <P>While acknowledging that accurate intra-country comparisons are difficult to achieve in view of the variation in the types of child income support provided in different countries, the report nonetheless concludes that Ireland was amongst a group of countries with relatively low levels of provision.  It does acknowledge the substantial improvements achieved in recent years, particularly for low income families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child income support policy in recent years has sought to ensure that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis a vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  There is widespread agreement that child benefit is one of the more effective mechanisms for the provision of child income support.  It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to families most in need and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.  As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical <Col N="572" /> cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
    <P>The increases provided for in the 1998 budget are targeted especially at the larger families, who are at greatest risk of poverty.  With effect from September 1998, the rates of child benefit are being increased by £1.50 for the first two children and by £3 for the third and subsequent children. This will bring the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  A family with four children, for example, will now receive monthly payments of £147 or almost £34 per week.  Provision is also being made this year for the introduction of a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme is being enhanced as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, from October this year and in line with a commitment made in the Partnership 2000 agreement, FIS will be reformed to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  The full year cost of the 1998 budget changes in FIS and child benefit is over £38 million; this compares to just under £33 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>The further enhancement of the child benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in the context of next year's budget.  I am confident, however, that in conjunction with the measures I have just outlined, the continued future development of child income support will have the effect of improving the value of the child benefit package provided here.</P>

      <P>The issue of family income supplement payments being assessed as income for the purposes of determining entitlement to local authority rent payments is among a range of issues being considered currently by an interdepartmental steering group which is charged with overseeing a study of the disincentive effects of secondary benefits and other entitlements.</P>
      <P>This group, which is chaired by my Department, comprises representatives from all the relevant Government Departments, including the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The group commissioned independent consultants to examine the effects of secondary benefits on the incentive to take up employment and training opportunities.  The consultants submitted their draft report shortly after Easter and this is currently being considered by the Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>The draft report finds that the inclusion of FIS in the income assessment for local authority differential rent has a significant negative impact on families in this sector who are on low incomes and in receipt of FIS.</P>
      <P>I have recently written to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, asking him to review the issues involved in the light of the consultants' report and of the views expressed during the Committee Stage debate.  I would be hopeful that in the light of the findings of the consultants who have considered this it will be possible to persuade the local authorities concerned to exclude FIS from their income assessments.</P>

      <P>Service to customers of my Department is provided through a network of offices around the country, 57 of which are local offices staffed by Department staff and 71 of which are branch offices operated on a contract <Col N="574" /> basis by independent operators on contract with the Department.  Branch offices take claims for unemployment payments and carry out certain other tasks associated with processing those claims.  Each branch office is under the control of a social welfare local office which carries out regular inspections of branch office operations.</P>
      <P>Over the years my Department has been engaged in a programme of fundamental change in the way it delivers its services to the public.  As a result of this programme of change, the departmentally staffed local offices now provide a wider range of services to customers, including more modern systems of payment.  It is my intention that the improved level of service currently being availed of by customers of departmentally staffed local offices will also be made available to customers of branch offices.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department are currently in discussion with the Branch Managers' Association in relation to the future role of the branch office network and with a view to upgrading and modernising the level of service which these offices provide.  A subgroup has recently been set up to consider the appropriate levels of remuneration for branch managers.</P>
      <P>Branch managers' current contracts do not contain any stipulations regarding the actual remuneration levels of branch office staff which is a matter to be determined by managers and staff in the normal way.  The terms of the contracts of branch managers are among the issues being covered by the discussions currently under way with the Branch Managers' Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputies relates to those former community employment workers who revert to the live register after completing a period on a CE scheme, and who, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance.  As a consequence, they lose entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The problem arises as a direct consequence of the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.  Similarly, the continued payment of child dependant allowances in respect of children aged over 18 and in full-time education applies only to recipients of long-term payments. Unemployment benefit claimants do not, therefore, have an entitlement to these benefits and payments.</P>
      <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or jobstart, etc.  It is important to note also that as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment would continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained to the House on many occasions in the past months, I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who requalify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients. Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities. <Col N="576" /></P>

      <P>Access to a range of labour market opportunities, including training, education and employment programmes, is generally confined to those who are signing on the live register for a specified period of time.  Access to the live register itself is available to both men and women who satisfy the conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance or who are entitled to sign for unemployment credited contributions.</P>
      <P>There are programmes available for which attachment to the live register is not a requirement and female participation rates in those courses have increased significantly in recent years.  However, I accept fully the principle that women who do not have access to the live register should not be penalised in relation to their access to labour market opportunities.  In this regard, in accordance with a commitment given in Partnership 2000, a working group has been established to review the question of access by women to labour market opportunities with a view to improving gender equity.</P>
      <P>The working group is chaired by my Department and includes representatives from the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, the Irish Farmers' Association, the Congress Centres for the Unemployed, FÁS, the Employment Equality Agency, Aontas and relevant Government Departments.  I expect the report of the group will be completed later this year and the Government will then consider what action needs to be taken on foot of the report.</P>

      <P>The general issue of fathers supporting their children is a family law matter and as such is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Social welfare legislation places an obligation on all parents to maintain their children, and on spouses to maintain each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research has shown that only about 12 per cent <Col N="577" /> of family law court maintenance orders are honoured regularly.  Where maintenance payments are irregular, or where efforts to secure maintenance fail, the social welfare system guarantees the lone parent, through the one parent family payment, a regular weekly income.  The Department in turn can seek recovery of maintenance payments from the absent parent through the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Act.</P>
    <P>The philosophy underlying the liable relative provisions is that if lone parents require support through a social welfare payment because of inadequate or no maintenance, the State is entitled to recover an appropriate amount from relatives who are liable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Voluntary and community groups play an important part in improving the quality of the lives of people by helping them to develop the capacity to change their situation for the better.  Recognising the importance of the role played by these community groups in local development my Department has for a number of years supported local self-help and community development initiatives by the provision of funding through a range of programmes and schemes.</P>
      <P>The community development programme was established in 1990 in recognition of the role of community development in tackling poverty and disadvantage.  The programme provides financial assistance to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised community development projects and initiatives having a strategic importance.</P>
      <P>The projects provide a range of supports, development opportunities and services to community groups and individuals within their areas. There are currently some 90 projects participating in the programme.</P>
      <P>In 1994, to mark the International Year of the Family, an allocation of £250,000 was made available by the Department to fund a number of family resource centres.  The decision was motivated by the perception of a possible gap in statutory support for community development activities focused on support for families and tackling child poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An evaluation of the work of these centres was published in 1997.  The key recommendation of <Col N="578" /> the report was that funding of these centres should be mainstreamed by this Department as a family and community services resource centre programme.  In addition, the Commission on the Family, in its submission on the 1998 budget, considered that these centres have significant potential as a primary preventive strategy and endorsed the recommendation for significant expansion of the Department's funding programme to support a network of centres throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The aim of a family and community services resource centre is to help combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit. Centres can provide special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families.  There are currently 14 centres participating in or in the process of being set up under the programme.</P>
    <P>Recognising the important role played by these centres in supporting families this programme is being expanded in 1998 and an additional £700,000 was provided in the 1998 budget to this end.</P>
    <P>The total provision in 1998 for both the community development programme and the family and community services resource centre programme is £7.759 million representing an increase of £2.159 million over the 1997 allocation.  Projects within both programmes are paid on a quarterly basis with a sum of £2.061 million paid to date in 1998 to projects in the community development programme and £74,250 paid to centres in the family and community services resource centre programme.</P>
    <P>There is no closing date for applications under either of these programmes and applications under both programmes are considered as and when they are received.</P>
    <P>For many years my Department has also provided assistance to voluntary and community groups through a range of once-off grant schemes; including the scheme of grants to lone parent groups, the scheme of grants to locally based women's groups, the scheme of grants to locally based men's groups, the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations, and the community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
    <P>These grant schemes concentrate on a wide range of support for local self-help groups, community development, welfare rights and information work, and on the provision of seed money to enable community groups to pilot initiatives identified as meeting new and emerging community needs.</P>
    <P>As many of the groups funded under these schemes provide supports for the family my Department has in 1998, introduced a new integrated scheme of grants to locally based community and family support groups &mdash; integrating the former schemes of grants to locally based women's groups, locally based men's groups and <Col N="579" /> lone parent groups.  In addition the Department continues to provide funding under the once-off scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and the community development education and training grants scheme.</P>
    <P>The 1998 once-off grant schemes were advertised earlier this year with a closing date of 12 March 1998.  Approximately 2,300 applications have been received at my Department's regional offices where they are currently being processed. Groups applying under the schemes will hear from my Department in due course.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main scheme of grants for locally based community and family support groups a total of 28 more established community support groups are in receipt of three year core funding in the range £8,000 to £35,000 under this scheme.  Applications from groups wishing to be considered for three year core funding are accepted at any time and are processed as soon as possible after receipt.</P>
    <P>The total budget in 1998 for the scheme of grants for locally based community and family support groups, including those groups that receive core funding, the community development education and training grants scheme and the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations is £2.825 million representing an increase of £100,000 on the amount provided in 1997.</P>
    <P>My Department also operates the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million, the same as the 1997 Estimates allocation, has been allocated to the 1998 scheme, which was advertised recently.  Voluntary and community organisations wishing to receive funding under the scheme should submit applications to the regional offices of the Department by 22 May.  Applications will be assessed as soon as possible after the closing date.</P>
    <P>Through the provision of the money advice and budgeting service, the Department is directly involved in activities to combat moneylending and over-indebtedness.  Forty seven projects providing advice and education to the local community in relation to money management and debt management have been established throughout the country.  The allocation to this scheme for 1998 is £3.143 million representing an increase of £943,000 over 1997.  Projects in this programme are paid on a quarterly basis with a sum of £1,003,113 being paid to date in 1998.</P>
    <P>Details of the total funding provided under all programmes and once-off grant schemes have been made available to the Oireachtas Library each year since 1990.  Details of the total funding provided in 1998 under each scheme and programme will again be provided to the Oireachtas Library at the relevant time. <Col N="580" /></P>

      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  The allowances continue to be payable where children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday, provided that the claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments, such as pensions, is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty. These arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-a -vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
      <P>In pursuance of this policy, the Social Welfare Act, 1998, provides the legislative basis for further enhancement of the child benefit scheme. Child benefit will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  In addition a special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be introduced.  These measures will take effect from next September.</P>

      <P>A range of measures have been put in place in my Department to ensure that members of the public and other interested parties can avail of their rights under the freedom of information legislation.  Because of the wide extent of the Department's business and its interaction with the public there is potential <Col N="581" /> for a high volume of requests for access to individual records held by the Department.</P>
      <P>The Act provides a statutory right of access to the reasons for decisions made by public bodies and to the guidelines used in making decisions on entitlement to payments and services.  The Department has improved the level of access to this type of information considerably in recent years.  Thus, the implementation of the requirements of the Act will involve the completion of a process which was already in train.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, my Department has published a reference book setting out its structure, functions and organisation.  It also gives details of the services it provides, how the public can avail of these services and the type of information held.  Also available are all the internal guidelines used in making decisions on entitlement to the services provided by the Department. The reference book and guidelines in relation to the individual schemes can be supplied on request from the Department's local or public offices or from the information service.  They are also available on the Internet.</P>
      <P>An information leaflet explaining the arrangements for obtaining access to social welfare records has been published and is available to members of the public.</P>
      <P>Information officers at the Department offices will be the first point of contact for requests for information under FOI.  These requests will be processed by specially designated freedom of information officers.  These officers have been appointed countrywide, that is, in all the Department's local offices, in the decentralised offices in Sligo, Letterkenny, Longford and Waterford and in the headquarter offices in Dublin.  Staff have also been designated to consider applications for review of decisions made by the freedom of information officers.</P>
      <P>All officers who will process requests under the Act have received specialised training on what is involved.  Over 2,000 other staff of my Department have been briefed on the provisions of the freedom of information legislation and the arrangements for dealing with requests for access to records.  This briefing is ongoing for remaining staff.</P>
      <P>An improved departmental records management system has also been developed which will ensure good practice in maintaining and accessing non-personal records and will assist the procedure in locating material requested under FOI. A request tracking system is also in the process of completion to monitor the type and level of requests received and the action required.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that all necessary arrangements have been made for the successful implementation of the freedom of information legislation in my Department.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment <Col N="583" /> of £5 per week, £8 per week in smokeless zones, is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
    <P>The fuel allowance was last increased in October 1985.  The fuel and light component of the consumer price index, CPI, rose by 8.3 per cent between August 1985 and March 1998. Increasing the basic allowance by this amount for the 1998-99 fuel season would cost £3.7 million.</P>
    <P>Extending the fuel allowance at £8 per week to all urban and rural areas would cost approximately £13.6 million.  This would give an increase of £3 per week to about 174,000 people.</P>
    <P>Any increase in the payment rate would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to the modest increase in domestic fuel prices since the current rate of the fuel allowance was fixed.  Changes in the national fuel scheme should not be viewed in isolation from the primary schemes and, in that regard, I would point out that substantial increases of either £3 or £5 per week in all the social welfare primary payment personal rates were announced in the 1998 budget.</P>

      <P>Detailed information on the total expenditure on rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for each health board region is shown on the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements has increased substantially over the last few years.  This was mainly due to increases in rent levels.</P>
      <P>In July 1994, following concern caused by the escalating costs in relation to rent and mortgage interest supplements a review group was established by Government to report on the role of SWA in relation to housing.</P>
      <P>The group was comprised of representatives of the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government, Finance, health boards and local authorities.  The group presented its findings in December 1995.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the housing review group report, an interdepartmental committee was established under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Finance, to examine the implications of transferring the administration of rent and mortgage interest supplements to local authorities.  It is expected that the committee will report shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the reason complaints to the Health and Safety Authority made in February 1998, regarding dangerous conditions for workers on a building site (details supplied), were not rectified by the Authority resulting in serious injury to a building worker at that site on 22 April 1998 when he fell from the roof.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>A complaint was received by the Health and Safety Authority on 26 February 1998, concerning the erection of scaffolding on the site referred to, as a result of which the site was visited by an inspector on 4 March.  The inspector dealt with the complaint and noted the safety standards in general on the site had improved significantly since his previous visits in August 1997.</P>
      <P>On 22 April, reports of an accident having occurred on the site were received by the authority in which a worker had sustained serious back injuries as a result of a fall of approximately eight metres from the roof valley of a roof under construction.  The site was visited that day and the authority's investigation of that accident is ongoing.</P>
      <P>On account of the nature of the construction industry, conditions on a construction site may vary from day to day as construction work progresses and only those on site can oversee and control safety.  Accordingly, the law clearly places the responsibility for ensuring safety on those in control of the workplace, including employers, contractors, the self-employed and the workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation.  The authority works to a targeted annual national programme and focuses on priority sectors with high accident rates, such as the construction sector. There has been a steady increase in the funding and staff allocated to the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health since its inception.  In 1990 Exchequer funding amounted to £2.3 million and in 1998 it will amount to £4.7 million.  In addition, Government sanction was secured late last year to enable the authority to increase its total staff to 119 with effect from 1 January 1998.  In order to address long-term future staffing needs, the authority has produced a comprehensive submission which is being studied, at present, by my officials and officials from the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>The authority continues to devote a significant part of its inspection resources to the construction sector.  For example, in 1997, out of a total of approximately 11,000 inspections countrywide across all sectors, 4,250, or 39 per cent, related to the construction sector.  The total number of inspections in the Dublin area was 2,979 of which 1,341, or 45 per cent, were in the construction industry.  The authority has inspection and enforcement responsibilities across all employment sectors and, accordingly, it is not possible to inspect all places of employment in any sector in any year.</P>
      <P>The authority has a wide range of enforcement powers available to it under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction Regulations), 1995 to ensure compliance with the law.  Those powers include the issuing of improvement directions where there is, or is likely to be, a risk to safety and health, improvement notices where an inspector believes that a law has not been complied with, prohibition notices where there is a risk of serious personal injury, the obtaining of High Court orders and, ultimately, the initiation of prosecution proceedings.  The authority regularly uses these powers where necessary.  In 1997, 240 prohibition notices were served in the sector, relating mainly to inadequate scaffolding and work at unprotected heights, and two High Court orders were obtained.</P>
      <P>The authority encourages compliance with health and safety legislation not simply through enforcement measures, but also through ongoing awareness-raising exercises such as the safe scaffolding campaign and by adopting and promoting a partnership approach to safety in the construction sector.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the fact that over 80 per cent of our retail clothing requirements are imported and that many of the countries exporting to Ireland use slave and child labour to produce their goods; and if she will introduce regulations regarding the labelling of country or place of origin.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>International trade is the lifeblood of the Irish economy and in recent years we have prospered from trade.  Our economic well-being is now inextricably linked to participation in an open trading system which offers opportunities for all our companies, including clothing companies.  The main focus of Government activity, as set out in the statement of national trade policy published in January this year, is on creating the conditions under which exporters can compete on an equal basis on world markets and where importers and consumers have access to raw materials and other imported goods at competitive prices.</P>
      <P>It is accurate to say that over 80 per cent of the domestic market for clothing is met by imports. In 1996 total imports were £713 million.  However export trade for the sector was also significant and total exports amounted to £325 million.  The Government's policy is to help the sector to become more competitive.  Since 1996, a special joint initiative is in operation between Forbairt and the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation to encourage indigenous small and medium sized companies to become more competitive.</P>
      <P>Three-quarters of Ireland's imports in the clothing sector come from our European Union partners.  The remaining 25 per cent of our imports come from a range of developing and developed countries.  Ireland fully supports international efforts, especially through the International Labour Organisation to eliminate slave and child labour practices and to encourage compliance with these and other core labour standards. Currently we are supporting ILO efforts to have a declaration on core labour standards adopted which specifically targets the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour and the effective abolition of child labour.</P>
      <P>Ireland also fully supports EU efforts to encourage compliance with core labour standards through the new EU generalised system of preferences, or GSP scheme.  Under the new scheme, preferential access to the EU market can be denied to countries which fail to ensure compliance with core labour standards.  This provision has already been applied against imports from Myanmar &mdash; formerly Burma &mdash; due to the use of forced labour in that country.  The GSP scheme also provides for the introduction of a new special incentive arrangement providing further duty concessions to reward those countries which can demonstrate compliance with ILO principles on the minimum age for admission to employment. The special incentive arrangement is expected to enter into force shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the way forward towards stamping out slave and child labour practices is through multilateral <Col N="587" /> action and not through imposing regulatory burdens in relation to country of origin labelling for all imports from outside the EU.</P>

      <P>The harbour at Ballycotton is owned by Cork County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the local authority.  Cork County Council has not made any proposal to my Department concerning the breakwater at Ballycotton.  In any event, the funding available for development works at fishery harbours is very limited and is necessarily focused in the main on a small number of strategic harbours.  It is unlikely, therefore, that aid can be provided for works at Ballycotton in the short term.  The matter will, however, be kept under review, in consultation with Cork County Council, having regard to available funds.</P>

      <P>The shell marl problem manifests itself differently on different sites.  A technical examination of all such sites is therefore necessary and is currently under way.  The owners of affected sites have been given permission to return such areas to agricultural use and have been advised to apply for aid under the REPS or the area aid scheme.  It is expected that the technical examination will be completed by end June, following which payment will issue as appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the provisions of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations are not being adhered to in the USA, thus denying foreign nationals of an internationally given right; if he will express the concern of the Irish Government in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to two recent cases, one involving a Paraguayan national in Virginia and the other a Honduran national in Arizona, both under sentence of death.  In both cases the state authorities neglected to inform the foreign nationals concerned of their right, under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to a visit by their consular representatives.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that in some cases state authorities are not informing foreign nationals of their right under the Vienna Convention to a visit by their consular representative, nor informing foreign consular representatives when one of their nationals is in custody.  I have no reason to believe that this is a result of a deliberate policy by state authorities but rather the result of a lack of awareness of their obligations. However, the United States federal authorities are aware of the breach of their obligations under the Vienna Convention.  I understand that, in the case of the Paraguayan national, Secretary of State Albright wrote to the Governor of Virginia requesting him to delay the execution.  The Secretary of State pointed out, <i>inter alia,</i> the possible negative consequences for the many US citizens living and travelling abroad, if some countries were to draw the conclusion that the US did not take its obligations under the Vienna Convention seriously.  Despite this the state authorities proceeded with the execution.  In the second case, that of the Honduran national, the State Department requested the relevant Arizona authorities to consider the fact that Article 36 of the Vienna Convention had been violated, although it did not, I understand, ask for the execution to be postponed.  Once again this was to no avail as the execution took place on 22 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> I understand the State Department is taking steps to ensure state authorities in the US will be informed of their obligations.  I have instructed the Embassy in Washington and Consulates General in the US to monitor the situation and, if further cases arise, I will make appropriate representations.</P>

      <P>The difficulty, which arose in this case, was due to the fact that the individual to whom the Deputy refers appeared to have been involved in two separate 1997 area aid applications submitted to my Department.  Under the terms and conditions governing area aid schemes an individual may only submit a single area aid application covering all the land parcels which he is farming in any one year.  My Department has recently completed an investigation into this matter and is satisfied that a payment can be made. Payment will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A submission to establish a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas in Ireland was formally presented to the EU Commission on 9 October 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the submission, the Commission raised the issues of conservation and overgrazing in connection with the REPS and special areas of conservation.  It is concerned to ensure that proposals affecting the extension and classification of land in the disadvantaged areas do not have an <Col N="592" /> adverse effect on areas which are being targeted by the REPS and SACs as requiring special attention.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Commission made it clear that discussions relating to overgrazing and conservation must be concluded before proposals affecting disadvantaged areas would be examined. These discussions have now been finalised and are due to go to the EU Committee on Agricultural Structures for formal approval later this week.  Following this, I will endeavour to ensure that the Commission begins its examination of the third tier proposal as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The functions of the Government Supplies Agency, GSA, are, <i>inter alia</i>, to arrange for the printing, publication, distribution and sale of parliamentary and other Government publications. This includes Bills, Acts, Statutory Instruments, SIs, <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, reports of committees, working groups, advisory bodies etc.  Also, to distribute and sell in this country &ldquo;agency&rdquo; publications, i.e. publications of the European Union, EU, World Health Organisation, WHO, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, United Nations and other such international bodies.</P>
      <P>Apart from publication of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the GSA does not normally initiate publications.

      <P>I have requested the GSA to circulate all Departments asking them, where feasible, to include an index in their future publications.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Revenue job assist programme which has recently been introduced, employers may qualify for a double tax deduction for three years where they offer a job to an unemployed person.  The back to work allowance is a payment directly to unemployed persons who take up employment or self-employment. It is part of my Department's employment support services designed to encourage long-term unemployed people to return to the active labour force.  Since it was introduced, over 33,600 people who were previously long-term unemployed or lone parents have availed of the allowance to take up new jobs as either employees or self-employed persons.</P>
      <P>The job assist programme differs from the back to work allowance scheme in the following areas. There is no minimum age requirement for job assist.  An age limit of 23 years applies to back to work allowance applicants.  To qualify for back to work allowance, a job must be a new or additional job.  All jobs, including vacancies, qualify for job assist.  A person must establish an underlying entitlement to unemployment assistance to qualify for back to work allowance.</P>
      <P>To qualify for back to work allowance, a person in receipt of unemployment benefit must undergo a means test.  No such condition applies to job assist.</P>
      <P>The Department's job facilitators are working closely with unemployed people and will advise them on the best support available in their particular case to help them make the transition to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The back to work allowance scheme is a direct incentive for unemployed persons to take up employment while the job assist programme is aimed at encouraging employers to take on unemployed persons.  The attraction of each will vary and depend on the particular circumstances of each case.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71, 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment for people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last December 10,330 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of over £37 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance is being increased from next June by £5, from £70.50 to £75.50, for those over the age of 66, and £3 for carers under 66, from £70.50 to £73.50.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the budget also provided for three additional improvements for carers.  The first two of these are of a more technical nature and benefit a small number of people.  These improvements are a disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the maximum level of the old age contributory pension in assessing means and the payment of carer's allowance for six weeks after <Col N="598" /> death to carers whose spouses were not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The third improvement is the provision of a free travel pass to all those in receipt of carer's allowance in their own right.</P>
    <P>As part of my commitment to improve the supports for carers, I have recently reviewed the operation of the condition whereby the carer is required to provide the care recipient with full-time care and attention and have decided to adopt a more flexible approach.  Carers may now attend educational or training courses or participate in voluntary or community based activities for around ten hours per week provided the carer makes adequate provision for the care recipient in his or her absence.  These new arrangements come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>Government policy has placed an increasing emphasis on the role of community care in supporting the vast majority of people who wish to remain in their own homes and in their own communities. The informal caring which carers provide is crucial in order to achieve that objective.</P>
    <P>In An Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, an interdepartmental working group, under the chairmanship of my Department, and with representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children, has been set up to review the carer's allowance.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.</P>
    <P>As part of the review process, a series of meetings have been held with a wide number of interest groups and other interested parties.  Consultations will also be held with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>As this review is still ongoing, it is not possible at this stage to outline any possible recommendations which might be made to develop the carer's allowance and consequently to give any indications of potential impact on hospital and nursing home care services.  The review is expected to be completed by the middle of this year and it will be published.  Further developments will be considered, in a budgetary context, in the light of that review.</P>

      <P>On 28 July 1997 the Government approved the construction of a new closed, medium security prison at Portlaoise on a client-led, design and build basis.  On 2 September 1997 the Government set out the procurement procedures for the proposed new prison.</P>
      <P>Advertisements placed in the Official Journal of the EU and Irish national newspapers invited &ldquo;requests to participate&rdquo; from private sector developers for the provision of a 400 place prison at Portlaoise.  A large number of &ldquo;requests to participate&rdquo; were received from consortia involving Irish and European developers.  With the professional assistance of the Office of Public Works, the submissions were examined and evaluated in accordance with the criteria as advertised.</P>
      <P>The six developers deemed most suitable were selected and were invited to tender.  A comprehensive technical and financial evaluation of the six tenders has been taking place and I hope to be in a position to announce the winner of the tender competition and sign a contract within the next three weeks.</P>

      <P>There are 37 remedial teacher posts allocated <Col N="605" /> to primary schools in County Wexford. These posts are shared between 84 schools.</P>
      <P>My Department recently embarked on an exercise aimed at establishing the precise position regarding remedial needs in all primary schools. As part of this exercise, all schools, including those in County Wexford, have been invited to make fresh applications based on their present level of remedial need.  Responses to this request are currently being received in my Department and the closing date for all such applications is 30 April 1998.  In these circumstances, my Department is not yet in a position to indicate the number of applications for a remedial service which may be received from County Wexford.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demands from other special needs areas.  I have to determine priorities and allocate available resources to best effect.  I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of schools in County Wexford will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>

      <P>Following the disbanding of the Irish Folklore Commission in 1971, the work of collecting, editing and publishing folklore material was transferred to the Department of Irish Folklore in the National University of Ireland, Dublin. To assist the Department in discharging its responsibilities, a folklore council was established comprising ten members.  Six members are appointed by the president of the university and four by the Minister for Education and Science. The president of the university also appoints one of the members as chairperson of the council.</P>
