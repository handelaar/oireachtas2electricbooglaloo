      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, taken to implement the report of the Review Group on the State's legal offices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the review group was presented to the former Taoiseach by the former Attorney General on 26 June 1997, the day they both left office.  Shortly after assuming office as Taoiseach I discussed the report with the Attorney General, arising from which I set in train a process of consultation with all Departments, the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners and the Director of Public Prosecutions to obtain their observations on the report with a view to having it considered by Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the report is a quite detailed document which raised fundamental issues for consideration concerning the State's legal offices and their relationship with Departments and offices.  I can inform the House, however, that the Government has considered the report and agreed that it should be published.</P>
      <P>The Government also accepted the recommendations of the review group for implementation as soon as possible and in particular to establish the proposed high-level study of proposals for a unified prosecution service, with a view to reporting both to Government through the Taoiseach within 12 months &mdash; the secretariat will be provided by the Institute of Public Administration; a separate statute law revision and consolidation unit within the Office of the Attorney General; and the proposed consultative committee to promote greater liaison and communications among the law offices on issues of common interest.</P>
      <P>I have arranged that copies of the report be placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that he said on 1 October the Government would be considering this matter shortly?  Is it possible that this matter was considered by the Government only because this parliamentary question was tabled for today?  Will the Taoiseach indicate what the high level study group will do that the previous Attorney General and the interdepartmental consultation, which the Taoiseach initiated on receipt of the report, have not already done?  Is this high level study group not just a delaying tactic by those who, for one reason or another, may not be willing to make a decision to have a unified prosecution service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not begin to examine the report until September.  The report is a detailed document and, in fairness to the various Departments involved, they put it through an internal consultation process before furnishing their observations.  That took a considerable period of time.  This question has been on the Order Paper for some weeks and that has given me time to press on with it.  The report of the review group is quite detailed, as I have already outlined, and we have accepted its recommendations.  On the question of the unified prosecution service, the review group examined that issue but did not come to a conclusion on it.  It stated that it did not have the expertise and the resources necessary to examine such a detailed matter.  It stated also that the matter should be examined in more detail and that is what the group now intends to do.</P>
      <P>This is a major issue and even a preliminary examination of it revealed that opinion was divided on what should happen.  The proposal currently is that the DPP would deal with the Central Criminal Court, the Circuit Criminal Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal, and that the Garda would deal with the District Court in prosecution cases.  This issue merits detailed examination and the group we intend to set up will do that.  I will shortly announce the members who will form that group.</P>
      <P>The report examined in detail the issue of the separate statute law revision and consolidation unit in the Attorney General's office.  It argued that we should consolidate legislation on an ongoing basis and not just in cases such as that in 1981 when we had the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Bill or the more recent legislation on the 1967 Income Tax Act.  We are going ahead with that process now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for acknowledging the value of a parliamentary question and the fact that this matter has been examined because this parliamentary question was tabled.  I hope that will be noted by those who next do a tally on the value obtained from parliamentary questions and the cost of every parliamentary question.  Parliamentary questions often do a good job, and this one did.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House the decisions, other than setting up further studies, the Government has taken <Col N="1023" /> on this report?  What will change next week as a result of the Government's decisions from what happened last week?</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply, we have accepted the recommendations of the review group for implementation.  Many of those recommendations will be useful in helping to make the offices more effective and efficient.  The main one is that we will have a separate statute law revision and consolidation unit within the Office of the Attorney General.  That will be a valuable unit in time to come.  It will not change matters overnight but it will be important.  We also intend to establish the consultative committee to promote greater liaison and communications between the law offices of the State as recommended in this report.  They are the Office of the Attorney General, the chief legal officer of the State, the DPP's office and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  The report outlines the mechanisms by which that should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My confirmed international travel plans up to June 1998 are as follows: annual dinner of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, and a gala evening to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Copthorne Tara Hotel, London on 26 February 1998; the launch of the Irish Post's Business '98 publication in London on 27 February 1998; the European Conference on enlargement in London on 12 March 1998; a visit to Canada and the United States for St. Patrick's Day; the Asia Europe Summit in London on 3 and 4 April 1998; the Special European Council on Economic and Monetary Union in Brussels on 2 and 3 May 1998; and the June European Council in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> There are no confirmed inward visits of Heads of State and Government in the period up to 31 July 1998.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Conference, the initial meeting on 12 March next will bring together the member states of the Union and the European states aspiring to accede to it.  The conference is not, formally speaking, part of the enlargement process but is complementary to it. The enlargement negotiations will be launched at the end of March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there is a specific invitation to him to visit Russia to discuss, among other things, Irish exports of beef to that country?  Will he indicate whether he intends to intervene in regard to the possibility of enhancing Irish beef exports to Russia and Egypt?  Does he propose to visit Egypt in pursuit of that matter? In regard to the Taoiseach's various EU meetings, has he specific plans to raise the issue of duty free sales, in view of the fact that their abolition from June of next year will not only increase transport costs into and out of Ireland but will substantially disadvantage many parts of Britain which are distant from the centre of Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the invitation to Russia, which has been in the Department for some time, and it is hoped that visit will take place in late summer.  On the restoration of beef exports, all Ministers, particularly the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I will do everything possible when the opportunity arises to promote and achieve success on that issue with all third countries. In regard to duty free sales, I raised that issue at the European Council meeting at Christmas.  Last night the Minister for Public Enterprise met Mr. John Prescott, the British Transport Secretary, and they will have further meetings.  I will continue to raise the issue of duty free sales whenever I have an opportunity to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware I availed of the opportunity at a recent meeting with Prime Minister Blair to raise the matter of duty free sales, in support of the case being made by the Government?  Will the Taoiseach raise this matter with Prime Minister Blair, given that Britain holds the Presidency of the European Union and it has the capacity to influence the agenda of Council meetings in a way that is not open to non-Presidency countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this issue a number of times with Prime Minister Blair and also in this House during our European Union Presidency, and I will continue to raise it at every opportunity. Deputy Bruton is aware of the difficulties for the ECOFIN Council and the Commission regarding this issue.  I am not sure if Prime Minister Blair will be able to do any more on this issue than we did during our Presidency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept his action as Minister for Finance in 1992, when he effectively sold the pass on duty free sales, was a mistake and does he regret it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very proud in 1992 to achieve an extension of seven years for duty free sales.  Unfortunately, when the Deputy was in a similar position at a later stage he was unable to do anything about the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>When I attempted to raise the matter I was told the opportunity to exercise the veto was in the then Minister's hands in 1992 and that when he acceded to the abolition of duty free sales at that time the game was over.  The only achievement then was an extension of time.  Will the Taoiseach inform the people of north Dublin and elsewhere that the person who could have made a difference in this matter was himself and that the Minister for Public Enterprise is currently engaged in a charade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong. He is either a political opportunist or he has a bad memory.  The argument made in 1992, in co-operation with Aer Rianta and the Department of Transport, was that the time should be extended.  Before attending that meeting I was asked to have duty free facilities extended to the end of 1995.  I managed to have it extended until the end of 1999.  Like other issues in Europe, it is our responsibility to put forward and argue our case.  On the morning before the final European Council meeting I stated in the House that that item should be included in the Irish Presidency. However, I accept that those involved were not able to do anything about this.  Far from criticising, the House should compliment me on having duty free facilities extended for a further seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must be joking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there were differences between the meetings in which he was involved and subsequent meetings in that he could have vetoed the abolition of duty free in 1992?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he also agree that everyone who attended such meetings in the interim has been in a difficult position because in seeking changes they must also seek unanimity?  Does the Taoiseach accept that his decision, as Minister for Finance, not to veto the abolition of duty free sales in 1992 is the origin of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that Commissioner Kinnock is in favour of reopening the issue and that the Commission is the only body, by means of a proposal to the Council, which can propose to do so?  Does he agree that one obstacle to reopening the issue is that Commissioner Flynn is not in favour of doing so?  Given that Commissioner Flynn <Col N="1026" /> was a member of Fianna Fáil but was reappointed to the Commission by me, does the Taoiseach agree that an all-party approach might be made to him to reconsider this issue in conjunction with his colleagues?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome any efforts to resolve this matter.  I do not accept Deputy Bruton's assertion about the veto because the original decision could have been reversed at any stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many precedents of the Commission changing its decisions.  The Commission initiates policy and it is our responsibility to encourage the Commission to change.  I am aware that Commissioner Kinnock has a view on this matter and that a number of Ministers, other than Finance Ministers, in various member states are anxious to make changes, particularly in respect of ferries.  The Minister for Public Enterprise spoke to the Secretary of State, Mr. John Prescott, about this matter last night and she will discuss it with the German authorities next week.  The Government and the political parties should continue to force this issue.  It will be costly for other countries but the cost to Ireland will be markedly greater.  The Minister for Finance will shortly receive a comprehensive report which will add to the case we have put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the point I made to the Secretaries of State for Wales and Scotland that if direct ferry routes between Ireland and the continent are discontinued because of the abolition of duty free sales damage to roads in both countries will increase due to the additional traffic involved?  Does he also agree that this will benefit neither country and that both should support the Irish case for a suspension of the decision to abolish duty free sales?  Will the Taoiseach consider lobbying not only at Westminster but also in Cardiff and Edinburgh with a view to gaining support?  Will he also consider lobbying Portugal and Spain which are likely to lose tourist traffic from northern Europe because air fares to non-EU countries in North Africa will be more competitive than those to EU member states due to the abolition of duty free sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already lobbied in Spain and Portugal and in the Nordic countries where ferries are an important business.  The case has been well put by the international group lobbying for duty free sales that airfares will increase substantially.  The report will show that.  We have already given a number of assessments, which I quoted at the European Council meeting in December.  I am glad to co-operate in a campaign that is already in train.  I assure the House that I have lobbied and will continue to lobby on this issue.  Our case has <Col N="1027" /> merit and it stood up when I got a seven and a half year extension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Finance in 1992 did the Taoiseach have the power to exercise a veto in relation to the package of decisions before the ECOFIN meeting that would have ensured that the duty free status could have survived?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992 I endeavoured, with the duty free sales lobby, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and Aer Rianta, to get a derogation as far into the future as possible.  We succeeded in doing so on the basis that we should continue to put our case on the employment issues and on the value to the economy of duty free.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 14, inclusive, and 82 to 84, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Governments issued their determination on Sinn Féin's participation in the talks last Friday.  They made clear that great care was taken by the Governments in arriving at their conclusions.  Against the background of the three day session of the talks in Dublin Castle last week, which allowed all parties, including Sinn Féin, the opportunity to state their views in full, the Governments wished to ensure that the fullest possible consideration was given to those views and to all the issues and factors involved.  Following on this, the two Governments had been obliged, as stated in their joint press statement, to conclude that the representations under rule 29 were upheld and that Sinn Féin should not be allowed to participate in the talks.  At the same time, the Governments stated that:</P>
      <P>Subject crucially to events on the ground and to convincing demonstration in word and deed that a complete, unqualified and unequivocal IRA ceasefire is being fully and continuously observed, it is the expectation of both Governments that Sinn Féin will be able to return to the talks on 9 March.  We will maintain contacts with Sinn Féin in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Governments acknowledged in their determination &ldquo;the positive contribution that has been made to the peace process by the IRA cease-fire of August 1994 and its restoration of July 1997&rdquo;. They also acknowledged &ldquo;the very significant and genuine efforts which have been made, and are <Col N="1034" /> being made, by Sinn Féin in working for peace&rdquo;. They made clear that they believe &ldquo;Sinn Féin will continue, together with the other parties, to have an important role to play in the bringing about of a comprehensive, inclusive settlement, and that the maintenance of the IRA cessation will also be critical in that regard&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have had copies of the conclusions of the Governments on the position of Sinn Féin in the talks laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas for further reference, together with their joint press statement.  Having regard to the nature of the procedures under which the Governments have made their determination on the case of Sinn Féin, I do not propose to comment further on it in any detail.</P>
    <P>Both Governments remain fully committed to the principle of inclusivity subject to the requirements of the Mitchell principles and we look forward to the return of Sinn Féin to the negotiations on 9 March on the basis set out in the joint determination.  As the House will be aware, the UDP returned to the talks this week.  There are, of course, other parties who remain outside the process of their own choosing.  They know that the door remains open for them.</P>
    <P>Like so many others, I was very disappointed that the multi-party talks session held in Dublin Castle last week, which it had been intended would focus on Strands 2 and 3, was dominated by the issue of Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>That said, we have to move on.  I continue to believe that there is a reasonable prospect of common ground being found to reach agreement in the weeks ahead.  In this regard, I am encouraged by Senator Mitchell's remarks last week that we are now at a point where there is a reasonable basis for believing that the talks participants can reach an agreement.  It is the clear will of the people that we have peace and that these talks succeed.  We must &mdash; all of us, working together &mdash; do our utmost in the period ahead to make this happen.  For our part, the two Governments are determined to do everything we can, working with the parties, to produce a settlement in the next six weeks.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to refer to the series of bomb attacks and attempted attacks which have been carried out in recent days, including those in Moira, Portadown, Belfast and Dromad.  I know the House will wish to join me in condemning those responsible and in expressing sympathy to those injured or otherwise affected.  These shameful acts bear out Senator Mitchell's prediction last week that the closer we get to the end game, the greater the incidence of violence designed to undermine the negotiations.  The best answer we can give to these extremists, apart from bringing them to justice, is to defy them, to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion and to expose the extremists for what they are.</P>
    <P>A number of talks participants, as well as Senator Mitchell, have spoken about the possible relocation of the negotiations away from the distractions <Col N="1035" /> of the media.  This, it has been argued, would facilitate a clearer, more intensive focus on the issues.  This is not an unreasonable suggestion and is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>I had a range of discussions and contacts with the participants to the talks and the British Prime Minister in the past week.  I do not propose to comment further on these contacts other than to say that I am constantly working, in whatever way I can, to promote and facilitate dialogue and agreement in the talks process.</P>
    <P>I met last week the group known as FAIT &mdash; Families Against Intimidation and Terror.  The group wished to highlight once again the importance of ending punishment attacks.  As the House will be aware, I have consistently called for the ending of such attacks and I do so again on this occasion.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of reported comments by Mr. Martin McGuinness in the Europa Hotel last night which implied that Sinn Féin was seeking to create new conditions for its return to the negotiating table?  Will he make it clear at his meeting with Gerry Adams this evening that the basis and the parameters of the negotiations are already established and there is no question of the Mitchell principles being set aside or watered down, that everyone at the negotiating table must be there on an equal footing with regard to their exclusive commitment to the democratic process?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the remarks last night but I have heard some remarks in recent days.  Everybody must be at the talks table on the same basis.  It would be entirely unhelpful for any party, group or individual to set down preconditions because the basis of the agreement and the parameters of the negotiations have been well established and it is only within those parameters we can operate.  The Mitchell principles, assigned by those who are participants, the basic structure of which we have been negotiating in one form or another, for the better part of two years, cannot be rewritten or altered by any party or group and must remain intact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach raise with Mr. Adams the fact that Sinn Féin declared itself unable to speak for the IRA a week ago when facing expulsion from the talks with regard to the two murders which led to its exclusion, and his most recent statement to the effect that the IRA was not involved in the more recent bombings? Does this indicate that the steps taken by both Governments in relation to the suspension of Sinn Féin was the correct one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the decision made by the Governments last week was the correct one. It was based on the security information available to us.  In any decisions we make in this area we have to be extremely cautious to base them on the best assessments.  We will continue to do that regardless of how unpalatable it might be for some people.  I have stated on a number of occasions that the assessment of the Irish Government is that Sinn Féin and the IRA are opposite sides of the one coin.  I had no reason to change that view.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the council representing the Government in the public interest not seek costs in the High Court action taken by Sinn Féin, on foot of the decision of the British and Irish Government to have it expelled from the talks, given that there was manifestly no way in which an Irish court would have jurisdiction over the decisions that were inherently of a political nature in Dublin Castle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. However, the Deputy will accept that, in the circumstances, the Government was anxious to move ahead and dispose of the case.  We were formally committed to putting forward our determination at 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach recognise that the undemocratic exclusion of Sinn Féin from the multi-party talks has caused a widespread and justified anger, not only among the significant section of the electorate which has given this party its mandate which I represent in this House, but on a much broader scale among people throughout the country?  While noting the Taoiseach's acknowledgement of Sinn Féin's significant role in the creation and pursuit of a lasting <Col N="1037" /> peace within the peace process in his initial response to the questions tabled, does he accept that there is an absolute determination on the part of the Sinn Féin leadership to pursue the peace process along the difficult course to its successful conclusion?  Does he also accept that the responsibility for overcoming this crisis rests not only with Sinn Féin but with all parties and with both Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Governments want to achieve inclusive talks.  I acknowledge the Deputy's statement that Sinn Féin wants to develop the peace process and wishes to see it move forward. While the Deputy may have a democratic mandate, we also have a democratic mandate to ensure that the Mitchell principles are adhered to.  Last week the Governments considered that the Deputy's party was in breach of that mandate. That is why the determination was issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I deplore the fact that this crucial subject has been narrowed to five minutes because of childish squabbling over the wounded vanities of party leaders.  I hope there will be no repetition of it during the by-election campaigns.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that extreme sectarian elements within the IRA, the UDA and the UFF who do not agree with the peace process will do anything to bring it down?  Does he agree that the policy of exclusion of the UDP and Sinn Féin pursued by the Governments plays into the hands of these elements and that when all parties are back in the talks they only have to carry out another atrocity to tear the process asunder again?  Is it not the case that the Governments' interpretation of the situation regarding opposition to violence is leading the process into a <i>culde-sac?</i></P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that pronouncements of a commitment to the democratic process and a renunciation of violence by leaders of parties such as Sinn Féin and the UDP should be sufficient for the talks to continue uninterrupted?  Will the Taoiseach agree that in view of the lack of progress it is crucial that a people's peace process, involving the ordinary people, communities and cross community groups, be brought into the frame?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mitchell principles were laid down and participants to the talks signed up to them.  They were clearly enunciated and all the parties in the talks understood what they meant. There is a difficulty that at times people outside the talks who want to wreck them can have an advantage.  We saw that last week and we saw it in Lancaster House a few weeks ago when what should have been two important weeks spent dealing with different strands of the talks were taken up entirely by serious issues involving serious breaches, in which people were killed.  We are trying to make the talks as inclusive as possible. We are trying to give a role to everyone <Col N="1038" /> involved.  I appreciate, as I am sure do all Members and party leaders in the House, that people are trying extremely hard to convince some people in their communities who do not want to listen.  We have to make every facility available to do that.  That is why I argued in recent cases that the exclusion of people from the process should be for as short a time as possible, while at the same time making it clear that the integrity of the process could only be maintained as long as we saw a dramatic improvement in the period people were out of the talks.  As I stated here last week, the process is based on democracy and non-violence.  There is no other way to do this.  Wherever we can assist people who are trying to make the process work we will do so. Where there are acts of violence we cannot do that.  I hope that over the next few weeks we can continue to work on the basis of the three strands, on the basis of the work that has been done on the equality agenda, on the demilitarisation issues, on the prisoners issues and on trying to get an understanding between loyalists and Unionists and Nationalists and republicans so that we can bring forward this process.  What we deeply require now is that Nationalists and republicans and loyalists and Unionists give us an opportunity and do not turn back to a small group of people who seem to be far happier shooting, bombing and maiming people than trying to allow people constructively to enter dialogue.  That is what I want to put my energy into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree a great part of the problem has been that the leadership in the republican and loyalists communities has failed completely to prepare supporters for the reality of compromise and for the reality that there must be a radical revision of their respective aspirations if there is to be any compromise?  Will he also agree failure to do basic grass roots political preparation is probably the cause indirectly of the recrudescence of violence that has occurred? That is a political failure the Taoiseach should address specifically to Mr. Adams when he meets him this evening.  Will the Taoiseach agree the continuance of punishment beatings represents the most barbaric attempt to maintain Nazi type control over particular areas by loyalists and republican terrorists and people are living in literal fear for their lives in those areas, fear of being brought before kangaroo courts and fear of being tortured and all that is happening on this island?  Will he also agree the Government is right in its strong maintenance of the Mitchell principles to protect the democracy of this State against pollution by such methods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton. Like other leaders in this House, I met representatives of the group against intimidation and terror who outlined the cases that have happened.  I am also aware that at least some parties in the North are trying to move people away from what is known as punishment type beatings to look at <Col N="1039" /> other ways of building up proper and legal community policing.  I support those efforts and condemn the barbaric acts which still continue and the treatment meted out to people who are guilty of small offences&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and should be dealt with by the authorities.  They should not have to face kangaroo courts with no opportunity to make their case.</P>
      <P>As I will be saying today and at all meetings, this House supported and argued for the Mitchell principles and there is a clear understanding of what they mean.  I do not see how we can have Mitchell principles with a revolving door, so to speak, or argue that one crime does not matter but another is serious.  I understand those who say it would be handy if that was possible but how could it be operated?  Would one argue that the victim is only half-dead, or distinguish between a failed and a successful attempt to blow someone up?  I could not make determinations on that basis.  It must operate on the basis of non-violence and democracy and I cannot think of any other way of doing it.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree, contrary to the view of Deputy Higgins, it is essential that the Mitchell principles are applied in the same way to all organisations, particularly those which have an acknowledged association with paramilitary groups?  Does he also agree that to do otherwise would strengthen the dissident elements on the loyalist and republican side of the appalling circumstances in Northern Ireland? We acknowledge that there is a struggle for supremacy in the republican movement between those who want to be engaged in this democratic negotiation process and those who feel the only way to achieve their objectives is a scorched earth policy.  However, is there not a limit to the latitude which a democratic Government &mdash; either the Irish or British Government &mdash; can give in dealing with them if they are not in a position to state clearly that they have no hand, act or part in an organisation which is engaged in killing or bombing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government wishes to ensure that we have inclusive discussions, that those who are included have signed up the Mitchell principles, and that we can move forward on that basis.  We will endeavour to do everything we can in that regard.  At the same time I acknowledge the goodwill for the talks process among the political groupings.  I am realistic enough to understand &mdash; as I am sure is everyone in this House &mdash; it is not easy to convince people to move away from practices of the past and we want to be as supportive as possible of people who are trying to do so in order to build the peace process and to convince people that the correct <Col N="1040" /> way to argue one's case is not through the barrel of a gun or with semtex but through dialogue and negotiation.  All my work is an attempt to do that in a way where we can be seen not to be walking away from people who are trying to work for peace, regardless of what side they come from.</P>
      <P>This week marks the end of three months of difficulties.  Since the beginning of December there have been a number of murders, bombs, threats and intimidation of one kind or another. We must continue to face up to that and not be intimidated.  No one should lose heart and as far as I am concerned we should try even harder.  The two Governments, the political parties and those who believe in democracy must see that the only alternative to a peace process, regardless of the details of a final outcome and how long it takes to negotiate a settlement, is to go back to what we have had for 30 years.  We should not allow ourselves to be derailed, undermined or intimidated by the handful of people or, perhaps, a few hundred if it is stretched to the outer limit, who hold a view which opposes that of the other 5 million people on this island.</P>

What steps does the <Col N="1041" /> Government propose to take to restore confidence in this process, particularly among those in the Nationalist community for whom that confidence is clearly no longer present?  They despair of the Government's position as representing the Nationalist view on this island.  I have witnessed and have had to contend with that reality since the expulsion of my party last Friday.

      <P>I reiterate to the Deputy that the Mitchell principles are vital to the progress we can make on this issue.  I am glad to hear him reiterate that his party has signed up to the Mitchell principles.  I ask him and his colleagues to do all they can to encourage those from Nationalist communities to have faith in the process, in non violence and in democracy so that we can all move together.  If we can do that, we will see that the work done and decisions taken by successive Irish Governments for the Nationalist communities in recent years to build confidence, argue their case and move forward issues of policing and prisoners were right.  I know the Deputy and his colleagues can have a substantial input into convincing people those are the right things to do.</P>

However, will the Taoiseach not agree that the Governments' policy of exclusion is giving inordinate powers to a few rejectionist paramilitary elements to tear the process apart and stir up sectarianism?  This tiny rejectionist element must no longer get a majority in its organisation but simply has to carry out a freelance sectarian atrocity.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible sale of TEAM to FLS has been discussed in this House on a number of occasions very recently, and I have set out both the general position and the position of the Government.  I have stated quite clearly there will be no strategic developments in relation to TEAM without the concurrence of TEAM employees.  There has not been any change in this position.</P>
      <P>All the issues surrounding the possible sale of TEAM to FLS are currently being addressed by management and employee representatives and are varied and complex.  I understand a number of meetings have been held under the chairmanship of the agreed facilitator, Mr. Gerard Durcan, who will determine the timescale for these discussions.</P>
      <P>Discussions held yesterday and today were attended by representatives of all unions in TEAM, that is, the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union, SIPTU; the Irish Airlines Executive Staff Association, IAESA; the Amalgamated Electrical and Engineering Union, AEEU; the Automobile, General Engineering and Mechanical Operative Union, AGEMOU; the Technical, Engineering and Electrical Union, TEEU; the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union, ATGWU; the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers of Ireland, NUSMWI; the Institute of Engineers of Ireland, IEI; and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, UCATT.  I understand a meeting will take place next Friday between FLS and the trade unions in TEAM.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate to comment on specific issues in advance of receiving any formal proposal from the board of the Aer Lingus group in the matter.  As I said, I have indicated to both management and unions that any agreement to sell TEAM will require the agreement of the workforce in the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The Government has not sought legal advice on that.  However, I am aware the groups of unions have employed legal representatives to probe those issues.  On the letters to members over the years, I understand agreement has been reached that if the sale does not proceed, the path to court action indicated earlier will be pursued by the unions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the memorandum of understanding between FLS and Aer Lingus relates to the 100 per cent shareholding? In those circumstances it would be prudent to obtain legal advice on the crucial issue of whether the letters allowed or prohibited such a sale.</P>
      <P>The Minister outlined the general position. There is a fear on this side that the general position will be outlined before 11 March, but the specific position will be outlined by the Government after that date.  Workers in Dublin Airport are concerned about this issue in the context of the by-election.  Is it the Government's position that the memorandum of understanding is a sale which the Government could authorise?</P>

      <P>The memorandum of understanding was the initial phase in the process.  An arrangement for a deal has not yet come to me and my Department and I have not referred such an arrangement to the Cabinet.  Each union is now part of the talks.  The timescale for the discussions in the context of the agreement between the unions and Aer Lingus will be determined by the facilitator.  The process shall be deemed to have concluded only when a settlement has been agreed on all the issues or both parties or the facilitator declare that the process is at an end.  All parties are in talks and we must await developments. The talks centre on information dissemination services, compensation, early retirement packages, pensions, employment in the airline, airline status, concession travel, pay increments, Aer Lingus shares and local issues.</P>

      <P>What steps has the Minister taken in terms of her concern for the workers to seek assurances from the chairman of Aer Lingus on behalf of the board that FLS will give guarantees of job security, particularly in the maintenance division?  If that were the case, people could be assured on entering the talks that their sacrifices on pay and conditions would help to secure their futures. Will the Minister outline the discussions she had with the chairman?  Has she met representatives of FLS at any stage or discussed this matter with them?  What efforts has she made to seek job security and continuity of pay and conditions for the staff of TEAM Aer Lingus?</P>

Until such a deal is proposed and it has been given political consideration, I <Col N="1045" /> cannot have a position on it.  A deal will involve many complex issues.</P>
      <P>I meet the chairman of Aer Lingus regularly.  I met him twice in the past three months and I have repeatedly stressed that the Government's emphasis is on the maintenance and growth of employment and on the concerns of the workforce.</P>

What timeframe has been set by Aer Lingus and the Government on consideration of this matter? When one proposes to purchase a house, a contract signing date is set.  What parameters in terms of time have been set for this matter?

      <askee>Minister for Public Enterprise</askee>
      <Quest>the value in monetary terms to Ryanair of the reductions and rebates of ground handling charges by Aer Rianta for its services provided to Ryanair at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports in the period from 1989 to 1994 inclusive; if this State aid provided through the State owned company Aer Rianta was reported by the Minister to the EU Commission; if so, on what date; and the response, if any, which was received from the Commission.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4939/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will set out the factual position and then outline the policy context surrounding these issues.  The rebates of Aer Rianta airport charges from 1989 to 1994 were not regarded as State aids and, accordingly, were not reported to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>As far as other forms of assistance to Ryanair are concerned, from inquiries my Department has made in the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I understand that Ryanair up to the end of 1994 received tourism marketing grants totalling £1,062,000 under the Operational Programmes for Tourism 1989-93 and 1994-9.  These were ERD funds from programmes which were generally available for tourism promotion purposes. Therefore, they did not constitute State aid.</P>
      <P>I also understand that FÁS provided £45,600 to Ryanair in the years 1991-3 under the FÁS training support scheme and a further £120,900 in 1993 and 1994 under the FÁS job training scheme. Such moneys are generally available from FÁS to industry for training support.  I also understand it was announced in late 1996 that Ryanair in the form of its subsidiary Ryanair Direct will receive assistance of £2.2 million over the years 1997-9 from Forbairt for the establishment of a new teleservice/tele-marketing business in Dublin.  This type of support to industry is widely available and I understand it generally comes under an exemption agreed with the European Commission from the State aid rules.  In line with this exemption the assistance to Ryanair Direct was not required to be reported to the Commission.</P>
      <P>Regarding the allocation of routes to Ryanair and Aer Lingus in 1989, the position is as follows. The then Minister for Tourism and Transport announced in September 1989 a Government policy for aviation.  The Minister granted exclusive rights to Ryanair in 1989 on routes from Dublin to Luton, Stansted, Liverpool and Munich.  At the same time it was decided to grant Aer Lingus sole rights on the routes from Ireland to Heathrow and Gatwick and from Dublin to Manchester and Paris.  The decision applied for a period of three years up to the end of 1992.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Aer Rianta rebate schemes, these have been an important element in the company's efforts to grow traffic through the three State airports.  The schemes contribute towards keeping access transport costs into and out of Ireland to a minimum and have helped to underpin tourism employment and employment growth generally.  The success of the schemes to date can be seen from the unprecedented traffic levels and the highest ever passenger numbers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the two airline policies introduced for three years in 1989, these arrangements were designed to focus aviation policy on a strengthening of the Irish presence on routes to <Col N="1047" /> and from Ireland rather than having two Irish air carriers, namely Ryanair and Aer Lingus, actively pursuing traffic on identical routes.  European Union aviation policy has since moved on to the position where all airlines are free to compete on all routes without restriction on capacity or fares.</P>
    <P>On the value of discounts availed of by Ryanair at Cork, Dublin and Shannon between 1989 and 1994, the figures are as follows: 1989, £500,000; 1990, £0.86 million; 1991, £1.2 million; 1992, £1.99 million; 1993, £1.92 million and 1994, £2.08 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply but I am not satisfied that the very large assistance given to Ryanair constitutes State aid.  The Minister put a large monetary value on the assistance taken out of the taxpayers' pocket and put into the rich man's pocket &mdash; these moneys will go directly to the chief executive and directors, who also benefit from the low wages paid to employees.  Will the Minister give this information to the Commission and ask it to make a determination on whether this assistance is State aid?  These schemes were designed not to create competition but rather to prevent it and give an advantage to one company.  It is extraordinary that the Minister who made this decision was the owner of the company disadvantaged by it.  I am referring to the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Seamus Brennan, who made the order excluding Aer Lingus&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister inform the Commission of the payments made to Ryanair under the various headings referred to in my question to see if they are covered by the term &ldquo;State aid&ldquo;?  Will she put a value on the cost to Aer Lingus of developing the routes which were handed over to Ryanair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Deputy all the figures requested.  I obtained them from the various Departments which have given grant aid in one form or another to the company.  I will ask my Department to raise the matter with the Commission. Assistance is available to any company from Forbairt and FÁS under various headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision made by the then Minister in 1989 was a definite policy one from which consumers have benefited.  I do not have figures with me but <Col N="1048" /> the travelling costs on some routes have decreased in recent years.  The various arrangements operated by successive Governments, trade unions and employers over many years brought about a change in the economic climate. This consensus, in turn, fuelled a huge interest in the aviation industry and benefited those who run airlines.  It is a pity this consensus is now being ignored by a firm which gained from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the consumer benefited from competition in the provision of services by airlines and not from the restrictive practice of banning Aer Lingus from developing certain routes?  Ryanair was the main beneficiary of this and its directors and chief executive were made very rich through the transfer of money from the taxpayers' pocket to their pocket.  Will the Minister bring to an end the system of rebates for landing charges, specifically for Ryanair?  These rebates are paid out of the taxpayers' pocket to a company owned by them. These rebates should be ended until such time as the company agrees to pursue normal industrial relations, particularly with reference to the baggage handlers.  Is the Minister aware of the serious and widespread threat to the social partnership and the agreements which have brought about a growth in the economy from this maverick company which is practising capitalism which dates from the last century?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the current situation poses a real threat to continued partnership between all the relevant concerns.  The removal of the arrangements governing rebates is a matter for Aer Rianta.  However, I will discuss the matter with the chairman of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the board of inquiry conducted by Iarnród Éireann following the incident at Knockcroghery was presented to my Department on 5 February.  As is normal practice, my railway inspecting officer is considering the detailed findings and recommendations of the report and will follow them up with Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Day-to-day responsibility for all matters relating to rail safety such as the frequency of track <Col N="1049" /> inspections and maintenance, including mechanical tamping, is a matter for Iarnród Éireann.  I have been assured that rail safety is the company's main priority.  Implementation of any necessary safety-related measures, whether at Knockcroghery or elsewhere on the rail network, is a matter for the company to undertake. However, in the course of discussions with the company I have emphasised the paramount importance of safety in all aspects of the company's operations.</P>
    <P>In so far as the specific accident at Knockcroghery is concerned, Iarnród Éireann's board of inquiry concluded that the derailment was caused by the failure of a track joint on the line.  It also concluded that the design and construction of the carriages had played a significant role in minimising the consequences of the derailment. The failure of the track joint was caused by a weakening of the track bed beneath the joint which led to the breakage of the two plates &mdash; called fishplates &mdash; under the action of passing trains.  The board of inquiry was satisfied that one of the fishplates was broken for a number of days prior to the derailment.  A routine inspection of this part of the track the day before the derailment failed to detect this breakage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the number of recent initiatives the company has taken to further improve operational safety on the railway.  In addition to the normal routine inspections, a special detailed examination of all jointed track throughout the country was made in response to the accident. Additional resources will be made available to implement the recommendations arising from these additional inspections.  The track inspection process for jointed track has again been reviewed and strengthened in both frequency and quality. The training needs of all staff involved in track inspection or maintenance have again been reviewed and will be further strengthened.  Train operating speeds have been reviewed and some additional speed restrictions have been introduced.</P>
    <P>On the safety review, proposals from prospective consultants were received on 3 February and a number of candidates who submitted proposals were interviewed by officials from my Department on 18 February.  I expect the successful applicant will be appointed this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On this specific accident, the Minister referred to the supervision of the track where the fishplate broke.  She spoke about the review and about improving the quality of these inspections. Is it the case that the preceding supervision was carried out on a wet day and the supervisors did not go out and spot that this fishplate was broken?  Will the Minister confirm whether this happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the heavy maintenance, that is the tamping machine process, because I understand the under track conditions were the main problem here.  Will the Minister give a commitment, given that there could have been fatalities in this <Col N="1050" /> case, that this heavy maintenance procedure of tamping the under soil to put in place the rocks, grit and equivalent of mortar, will be implemented so that we will not be dependent on the day to day inspections?  If it is a wet day and somebody just does not notice that a fishplate is broken, there could be fatalities.  That is not acceptable.  What heavy maintenance programme will the Minister put in place arising from this incident?  Can she confirm there was a breakdown in the supervisory inspection process which led to this accident?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if the day in question was wet.  I do not have any detail of the weather.  I am not trying to be facetious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The weather was not noted in the report I received.  The board of inquiry was quite clear that in the inspection on the previous day this was not noted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to mechanical tamping.  I am informed that the last time the stretch of line was manually tamped before the accident was in July 1997.  However, I agree with the Deputy that there needs to be a greater emphasis on tamping. The routine inspections have been strengthened both in frequency and quality.  Iarnród Éireann tells me the engineering staff are maintaining a close watch on all of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If a mobile gang went out to supervise a line of track the day before an accident took place and the fishplate was broken, how did they not spot it?  Is that not something which the Minister would ask the Secretary General of the Department, the board of inquiry or the Chairman of Iarnród Éireann?  Will she specifically undertake now to look into what is meant by &ldquo;to improve the quality of these inspections&ldquo;? According to some of the material I saw on this report, she will find there was a breakdown in the supervision process.  Is the Minister prepared to give a commitment to this House that an investment programme will be put in place to provide this heavy maintenance?  It is essential.  Will she clarify why this inspection system failed on this occasion?</P>

      <Quest>if she will ask the Luas consultants for an interim report on their findings to be made available prior to the EU review of Luas funds in view of the remarks of the DG16 Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies during her December visit; and if she is considering any other public transport responses to growing traffic chaos in the capital, in view of the short-term delay in Luas due to the study and the possible very long-term delay if the Luas funding from the EU is lost.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect to receive the consultants' report on the option of putting the Dublin light rail system underground in the city centre at the end of April.  Given the short timescale for the overall study and given the volume of analytical work and evaluation which the consultants have to carry out within a very tight timetable, they will not be in a position to reach any useful conclusions until late in the study.  An interim report would not, therefore, advance the decision making process and could delay completion of their final report.</P>
      <P>The consultants' report will be received in time to be taken into account during the review of EU funding for the Luas and other projects.  This review will take place later in the Spring in preparation for a meeting of the Community Support Framework Monitoring Committee which I understand has been scheduled for June.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies last November I briefed her fully on the current position in the Luas project.</P>
      <P>Details of the plans to improve Dublin's existing public transport network &mdash; many of which were outlined in the Deputy's study yesterday &mdash; thereby contributing towards easing the traffic congestion, were set out in my reply to Question No. 58 on 16 December 1997.  These plans include implementation of the 11 quality bus corridors and three DART-suburban rail corridors as recommended in the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  Bus Átha Cliath is continuing to upgrade its bus fleet and to review its network to meet changing passenger demand.  New stations are planned on the Maynooth line and additional rail-cars are on order for the suburban rail network. It is essential that work on all these measures continues as, when completed, the light rail system will still only serve three of the 16 radial public transport corridors.</P>

      <P>The purpose of making this request for an interim report of the Atkins study <Col N="1052" /> was to allow us some time to prepare our case to Europe and to assure them that we are serious about proceeding with the Luas project and committed to proceeding with it immediately.  I know the Minister is aware that the Commissioner stated that she wanted to see progress this spring. I notice spring is rapidly turning to summer.  The six month report is now due at the end of April instead of March, as was previously promised.  It is now eight months since the cancellation of the public inquiry.</P>
      <P>The truth is that we have made no progress whatsoever.  We have gone backwards.  Is it not unreasonable after eight months to ask for at least some indication of whether an underground option is being considered?  It may or may not be in time to save the EU funds, but at least it would give us time to go to plan B.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If an option is given to run the system underground or partially underground, has the Minister given any direction to the Luas team to prepare for such an eventuality, for instance, to proceed with the building of the line as far as the city boundary in the case of either Tallaght or Dundrum?  Is there a plan to use any other public transport option such as the provision of additional buses?  The Minister outlined her plans for public transport and referred to quality bus corridors, but quality bus corridors without sufficient buses are not any use to the citizens of Dublin.  What is plan B?  What initiative will be brought forward if the EU money is lost or if there is a recommendation to route the system underground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the plans of the Dublin Transportation Office.  They include implementation of 11 quality bus corridors; three DART suburban rail corridors; Bus Átha Cliath is continuing to upgrade its bus fleet and will review its network to meet changing passenger demand; new stations are planned on the Maynooth line and additional rail cars are on order for the suburban rail network.  Regardless of whether the Luas project is over or underground, it will account for only three out of the 16 radial public transport corridors.  We cannot get away from that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> I realise people become frustrated when they are caught up in traffic, but I recently attended a major seminar on traffic congestion and the majority of people in attendance told me afterwards that they will not use Luas because it would not suit their requirements.  The nonappearance of Luas has become a crutch on which people have put their anguish about the traffic problem in Dublin, and I understand that, but it will take up only three out of the 16 radial public transport corridors.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Mitchell on her proposal. I have long been a supporter of Deputies bringing forward position papers, consultation documents, etc.  when in Opposition, and in Government also when the opportunity arises.  It increases one's knowledge of various issues.  In the Deputy's document, her party leader referred to investment in Bus Átha Cliath and the need for more buses.  Bus Átha Cliath is aware of that and plans to invest in additional buses to fill those quality bus corridors.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a specific question.  In my party's analysis of the traffic crisis, and taking into account the work of Owen Keegan and the traffic department in Dublin Corporation, there is a major change in car parking arrangements.  There is now a charge for all inner city off-street parking.  The purpose of that is to get more people out of the car and into the bus. What exactly is the proposed increased capacity in the short-term by Dublin Bus for those commuters, given that on most radial routes there is standing room only one-third of the way along the route?  The existing capacity must be increased by 30 per cent or 40 per cent.  With the change in the traffic department's decision on parking, what is Dublin Bus doing to increase capacity?</P>

      <P>I do not have the number of buses in my file that Bus Átha Cliath will need to adhere to all the rosy plans Fine Gael has for us all.  One would never think it was only six months out of office.  To answer Deputy Mitchell, who tabled the question, there will be a Luas system which will be in existence long after everybody in this House has gone.  When I came into the Department I discovered that no objective evaluation of the proposals had been carried out.  This is a matter that will change the face of the city, yet no Minister had made any examination of the proposals, and I did not intend to hang my hat on half baked proposals.</P>

      <Col N="1061" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share time with Deputies Wade, Browne, McGuinness and Ryan. Last week I spoke about the broad effects of the Finance Bill.  I now wish to concentrate on two issues of concern to me.</P>
      <P>With regard to the capital allowance section of the Bill, the lower limit of £25,000 as a proposed threshold is too low and mechanisms should be found to encourage and promote investment.  The Minister should consider putting in place a limit of £75,000.  That figure may not be acceptable but, during the debate on Committee Stage, I hope the Minister may be convinced to allow the continuation of funding by private individuals of developments and investments through the availability of capital allowances.  I hope he will increase the limit.</P>
      <P>Of greater interest to me is the current Revenue practice of limiting to 12 or 13 the number of persons interested in forming a consortium to finance developments.  There should be no upper limit on the number of those who may become involved in such a scheme.  This is further highlighted by the reduction of the lower limit to £25,000 which will make it almost impossible to fund reasonably sized or large projects using the medium of capital allowances to encourage people to invest.</P>
      <P>With regard to the urban renewal scheme, I echo sentiments welcoming a further scheme which will prove useful in respect of the renewal of cities and towns and encourage further investment in city areas by individuals.  Renewed and refurbished property which is sold to first-time buyers should be exempt from stamp duty.  This would allow it to compete with new housing on an equal footing.  Where major refurbishment of such properties has occurred, I suggest that proportionate value be placed between the cost price of the property and the cost of refurbishment.  A definitive line can then be drawn and the uncertainty in respect of allowances removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Three years is too short a period from the time of designation to the assembly of a site, to the application and receipt of planning permission, to the construction stage and finally to the occupation of a premises.  This has been highlighted by previous urban renewal schemes where time extensions have always been required.  While I do not oppose the use of extensions to prompt people to act quickly, it is unreasonable to have too short a period initially.  This Bill acts as a deterrent to the accumulation of sites mid-way through the scheme when the period would have commenced and the time remaining would be too short for the completion of a project.  That militates against the success of an urban renewal scheme.  Consideration should be given to allowing for a form of registration by the participants in the urban renewal scheme to show their intent at an early stage.  When they complete their <Col N="1062" /> projects they should then qualify for a period of three years from the registration.  This would be better than putting a scheme in place that limited a particular project to a three year period.  I will elaborate on this idea to the Minister by way of submission.</P>
    <P>With regard to capital gains tax and development land, I understand the Minister's intention to retain the 40 per cent rate for development land while reducing the rate to 20 per cent for other capital gains on buildings, etc.  However, I sympathise with the observations of the Construction Industry Federation.  It militates against the supply of building land suitable for development in that the proposed vendor will value his land at 60 per cent, which is the sum he will retain.  This will keep the cost of development land high and, as we know, this will be passed on to house purchasers.</P>
    <P>The reduction by the Minister from 40 per cent to 20 per cent in other categories will stimulate the economy greatly and will be seen as a positive move, particularly in the property market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Flynn's contribution is excellent and some of his ministerial colleagues should hear it.  Therefore, I call a quorum.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>However, as a variation on what the CIF suggests, I suggest an alternative to reducing the 40 per cent rate to a common rate of 20 per cent for other gains.  The Minister might consider using the surplus 20 per cent achieved on development land as a fund to be made available for the acquisition of land for public housing and services.  In this way two successes would be achieved at once.  It would address the needs of the CIF for the availability of further lands and as a direct result of the differential the Minister would also assist local authorities with funds for the acquisition of land for public housing.  This is a new idea to which careful thought should be given.  I will make a submission to the Minister on this proposal.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my remaining time with Deputy Wade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is a man of great courage and vision.  His proposals as laid out in the budget and in this Bill, will lead to a fair and equitable spread of resources, contrary to what the Opposition and some commentators have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made in some quarters about the budget being a budget for the rich, a view I contest.  About £500 million in personal taxation will be given back to the people, including the elderly, the widowed and the lower paid.  The <Col N="1063" /> people see the budget as they see the Government &mdash; efficient and effective.  It has popularity ratings not seen since the 1970s and this has been brought home to me on the doorsteps of Limerick East during my canvassing for Sandra Marsh, who will join me next month on the Government benches. Her campaign was launched yesterday in Limerick by the Taoiseach.  I was struck by the enthusiasm and &lsquo;feel good factor&rsquo; for her, the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, aware of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieWade" hpid="Mr. Wade Mr. Wade">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wade</NameTxt>
      <P>The people realise that in electing Sandra Marsh to the Dáil they will be enhancing the resolve of a Government which has delivered for them.  She has worked tirelessly in the constituency and with each passing day she makes a more positive impact on the electorate.  Her message is clear &mdash; she has a hunger to serve and to be part of a Government which is working locally and nationally.  Thousands of jobs have been announced at Dell and more are in the pipeline. Major drainage schemes for Cappamore and the building of a new bridge over the Abbey River are to go ahead.  Limerick Regional Technical College has had its status significantly upgraded. There is to be a major investment in a number of schools.  There is a dogged fight under way for the retention of duty free sales which will have a significant impact on Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The people in the constituency are also responding to the cut in tax rates by two percentage points for over a million taxpayers, giving the hard pressed PAYE workers a break.  An important step has been taken in moving to a standard rate of 20 per cent and a top rate of 42 per cent or perhaps 40 per cent if the economic climate allows.  The most significant changes have occurred in the tax rates but I welcome the changes in the bands and allowances.  This Bill is pro-enterprise and pro-worker and all workers will be better off after the changes take effect on 6 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crocodile tears shed by the Opposition for the lower paid do not fool anyone.  Many low paid will get more from this budget than they did last year.  The whining from the benches opposite appears shallow when one considers that the Minister for Finance, with his so-called &lsquo;rich man's budget&rsquo; has increased social welfare payments well above inflation and given an extra £5 per week to pensioners.  This is in contrast to the paltry increases granted by the last Government. In keeping with this, he placed great emphasis on the long-term unemployed with employers getting extra tax relief for taking on people who have been out of work for more than 12 months who, in turn, will be given an incentive to take up work.  For the first time in 20 years our unemployment rate is below 10 per cent and below the EU average of 11.5 per cent.  This measure will benefit <Col N="1064" /> the long-term unemployed who often find it difficult to return to work.</P>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister on reducing capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. This will encourage investment and growth in the economy and, in time, increase revenue to the State from this tax.  The 40 per cent rate was penal and a disincentive to investment.  Members of the Opposition attacked the Minister for this move by claiming it is a bonus for the rich.  Are they anti-enterprise?  Can they not perceive the stimulation and growth this imaginative step will give the economy?  If, as they argue, it is pro-the rich, why has the Minister cut back on certain tax havens and shelters favouring those on very high incomes and with large amounts of capital with which to play around?</P>
    <P>The introduction of tax relief on donations to domestic charities has long been sought by the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group.  It is a great shot in the arm for the important work of the many groups working in this area.  The Minister for Finance is a sensitive and down to earth person and he has demonstrated this in the Bill by changing the authorised opening hours for betting shops to acknowledge the reality of current betting practices and the staging of sporting events in the evenings and on Sundays.</P>
    <P>In the brief time available to me, I have touched on some of the important areas of the Bill, but there are many more which commend it to the House.  The Minister has delivered in the Bill and the Government is delivering for the country.  In my constituency of Limerick East the budget has been seen for what it is, pro-enterprise and pro-development.  It has introduced greater equity in the tax system while at the same time catered for the low paid and disadvantaged.  The great Sean Lemass once said that a rising tide lifts all boats.  This Bill and the work of the Government is propelling that momentum as the tide of the country's economic success continues to rise. The message has got through that a vote for the Fianna Fáil candidate, Sandra Marsh, in the forthcoming by-election is a vote for stability and the excellent work of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in Government who produced this Bill.  I heartily commend it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the Bill.  There has been a remarkable transformation in our economy and the quality of life of our people in the past ten years.  The Celtic tiger is roaring ahead and new houses and hotels are being built throughout the country.  Ireland appears to be the in-place in the European world.  The economy is booming and we have low interest rates and inflation.  It is important, however, that the benefits of the Celtic tiger are spread to all sections of the people.  The old, the sick and low income earners <Col N="1065" /> must get their share of the booming national cake.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the effective way he introduced the Bill and the measures in it that will benefit the various sections of our community. I am pleased he reduced income tax rates and that more than one million taxpayers will benefit by two percentage points.  We must recognise the burden carried by taxpayers for many years when the economy was not booming and we were told we had to tighten our belts.  As the workers were the first people who had to tighten their belts, we must ensure they benefit when the economy is booming.  The hard pressed taxpayer has paid enough over the years and Governments over the past few years have seen fit to pay them back.  The Minister for Finance has continued along those lines.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has also introduced many measures that will benefit the aged, the sick and the unemployed, those in need of extra income to enable them have a reasonable standard of living.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance outlined many of the changes he proposes to make as the Bill passes through the House.  He recognised the important role played by investors by reducing taxes in that area.  We must continue to encourage people to invest in the economy to ensure jobs are created. Many of the measures introduced by the Minister are job orientated and will give people the incentive to invest in the economy.  There are currently five or six large cranes along the skyline in Enniscorthy. In the past large cranes were seen only in Dublin, Cork and other major cities.  New hotels and houses are being built in small urban centres and much of this is due to the urban renewal scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Various Governments in the past ten years have been committed to urban renewal.  That scheme has given a major boost to small urban towns and it must continue to operate.  The Minister should extend the scheme in towns where it already operates and approve applications from towns that wish to join. If investors are given some tax incentive they will invest in these areas and thus create jobs.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government has stated that towns must meet certain criteria to qualify for urban renewal in the future.  A committee in the Department will assess new applications for inclusion in the scheme.  The old system whereby applications were assessed by the Minister should continue rather than introduce a bureaucratic nonsense whereby selected people will decide whether, for example, Gorey or New Ross should be included in the scheme in the future or Enniscorthy or Wexford Town should get an extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The seaside resort scheme is also proving successful. Approximately 1,000 houses will be built <Col N="1066" /> in Courtown Harbour in the next 18 months under that scheme.  This proves that if a seaside resort is given a tax incentive developers will invest in the area.  Practically all those houses have been sold from the plans.  The Minister should forget about the pilot scheme and examine the possibility of extending the scheme to other areas under this Bill.  If he does, he will reap the rewards.  He should include Rosslare Strand, Rosslare Harbour and other areas of County Wexford and further afield who are seeking seaside resort tax status.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the exemption of severely and permanently disabled persons from vehicle registration tax and value added tax on vehicles and excise duty on fuel.  Under the current system operated by the Revenue Commissioners it is practically impossible for people to qualify and the Leas Cheann-Comhairle, who is a former Minister for Health, will be aware of this.  Under Appendix A in Regulation 3 a number of criteria are listed for qualification for this benefit.  However, unless one is confined permanently to bed, one will not qualify because of the criteria which have been laid down.  Hundreds of people are ruled out who want to acquire vehicles under this system.</P>
    <P>Medical people tell me that unless the Revenue Commissioners relax the criteria, nothing can be done and they must use the &ldquo;mark a box&rdquo; system. If one is outside a box, there are no half way measures and one does not qualify.  Will changes be made in this area on Committee Stage?  It is important for those who are disabled and want to acquire independence and the system should be interpreted more flexibly by the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister for Finance is a compassionate man and is very interested in people with disabilities.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Mary Wallace, who is responsible for this area, has introduced many initiatives and changes.  I hope she also takes this issue up with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I refer to the problem surrounding publicans with six day licences who want to acquire licences for seven days.  I am not that interested in publicans but they have a genuine case.  Seemingly, in days of yore, people could change from a six day to a seven day licence but a former Minister decided to abolish that provision.  However, it affects only a small number of publicans.  Will the Minister look seriously at reintroducing that provision to enable people to change their licences?</P>

      <P>As a new Deputy, I welcome the Finance Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction.  I wish to focus on two points. The first relates to the reduction in the level of investment from £1 million to £250,000 in business expansion schemes.  I have already raised this with the Minister.  Will he reconsider this provision as a number of advance factories were planned under the scheme?  The limit of £250,000 <Col N="1067" /> on that type of investment is small.  The type of building involved would be the equivalent of a lock-up shop or warehouse which was not envisaged for such investments.  The investment could be controlled through the IDA by limiting the number of licences issued for the building of advance factories and ensuring that is the purpose of their issuance.  That would ensure the investment was focused towards a particular sector and would be of assistance to the IDA in developing industry and technology parks.</P>
      <P>I specifically referred to the investment by the IDA in a 60 acre site in Kilkenny as an example. It is a new site and the only means for developing it is through the BES.  If it is limited to £250,000 it will not be possible to drive the development forward.  If the Minister sees fit to open and control investment at the same time via the issuance of licences through the IDA, then a £1 million BES would be a great advantage.  Presumably, if it is limited and the Minister does not consider the matter, the IDA will enter rent and other arrangements which will cost more money.  Will the Minister review that section and provide comfort to community organisations who are trying in partnership with the IDA to develop business or technology parks in which the IDA has invested? That is the way forward and is the future for local government and IDA partnership proposals.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister review proposals on tax returns by accountancy organisations?  Great strides were made in recent years in terms of co-operation between the Department of Finance and these organisations.  The bringing forward of the date for returns will cause serious problems, especially for small businesses.  Will the Minister review the section and consult further on it?  If it must be introduced, he might suggest a later date for the introduction of this part of the legislation in order to give people an opportunity to develop the idea with accountancy firms and give small businesses the opportunity to get their act together.  By doing so, it will cause less harm to the excellent work that has been carried out between small business, accountancy firms and the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his work.  He lived up to promises made during the election campaign.  We promised to cut taxes and have followed through on that. The budget was well balanced but obviously everything that one wants to cover will not be covered.  When in Opposition, Members highlight areas in which money has not been spent, but I will refer to one or two which will hopefully be covered in the next budget.  This is not a rich man's budget.  It could not possibly be so when it includes a £300 million increase in social welfare spending.  Taxes were cut and at the same time the less well off in society have been looked after. The Minister struck a good balance in this regard and people welcomed the increases in social welfare benefits and the decease in taxation.  It is <Col N="1068" /> unfair to the Minister to say that he is Thatcherite and very right wing.  He is not and he has struck a good balance in the Bill.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of criticism about capital gains tax.  In the vast majority of cases, people invested after they paid tax while in some cases the investment has not paid off and the people involved will not receive a tax rebate.  The Revenue Commissioners will not give a rebate when one has suffered a financial loss.  We cannot forget that money was made and the capital gains tax was cut.  There are many people who have invested in shareholdings and who may or may not have made money.  There is a disincentive for people to sell shares before the cuts.  I expect the amount of money from capital gains tax will increase in the next few years.</P>
      <P>I wish to return to the area of child care.  The number of people paying for child care has increased enormously.  Society is changing and we must address the whole area of child care.  Many couples are put to the pin of their collars to pay mortgages and child care even with two incomes. An imaginative package should be put together to help people in this area between now and the next budget.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his endeavours and I have no doubt this is one of many budgets he will introduce.</P>

      <P>Despite protests from Deputies on all sides there is general acceptance among workers, trade unions and others in society that promises made in the programme for Government have not been met.  Unfortunately, that is the reality for many people.  Many of us have been present on budget day when it was impossible financially to meet not only the expectations of the poor, the disadvantaged and the disabled but their needs.  A huge backpayment was owed to the less well-off because during those difficult years we had to pay off an enormous national debt and cope with high unemployment levels and a vast array of social issues, that can now be addressed in this buoyant economy.  We regret that in the first budget when something could be done for those people we did not grasp the opportunity and run with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sense of compassion in Irish society. There is almost a sense of guilt in society because of where we came from.  When times are good we owe it to those who have not yet made it to help them.  This Bill, and the budget, signally failed to tackle this area.  It is regrettable that so many people were not catered for in the budget and the Finance Bill.  We should all put pressure on the Minister for Finance between now and the next budget to help those people.  The projections are favourable, the economy is buoyant and we can afford to plan and spend in a way in which we did <Col N="1069" /> not have the confidence to do previously.  That reflects the views of the majority of voters.  Given that we are a compassionate and caring society, people are prepared to pay tax if the money goes towards what is fair and equitable but they resent high income earners and investors getting a bonus and an opportunity to which they cannot aspire. Based on that assumption the Minister should get the message loud and clear for next year.</P>
    <P>A Finance Bill does not exist on its own.  The Finance Bill, the budget and tax reform have a huge bearing on society and on the quality of life. It is ironic at a time when more young people are working, incomes and salaries are higher and we have a more educated workforce that they cannot aspire to house ownership.  Even with high salaries and job security they cannot raise the necessary deposit or pay a large mortgage.  This has implications for the labour market.  The tax bands have not been widened to give the low and middle income earners more take home pay to enable them to repay a mortgage or aspire to house purchase.  The long-term unemployed and married women must be encouraged to move away from social welfare through financial incentives in the tax bands.  Those who are working are contributing enormously to the Exchequer and the buoyant economy.</P>
    <P>The issue of stamp duty should be examined as well as the income level towards shared house ownership.  Some middle income earners do not have a hope of raising a deposit for a house in view of present high prices.  The level of income at which one is eligible for shared ownership, a scheme which has been successful and should be expanded, could be the first step towards house ownership.  The rate of stamp duty should be looked at especially for first time buyers.  There has been a huge investment in house property by the well-heeled while those who need houses are on modest incomes.</P>
    <P>Couples who have been fortunate to get houses are engaged in a high risk work pattern because house prices and mortgages make such demands on their pay packets and on their future security. It is a travesty that the budget did not reduce tax or provide incentives towards child care for parents who are working under great pressure.  The pressures and tensions in the household are great and if both partners are to continue working to meet all the expenses of our high class society, they have to pay high levels of child care fees without State recognition, child support or tax consideration.  We are forcing women especially, including those who are highly qualified and trained, to give up their jobs, pension rights and career opportunities because it no longer makes sense for them to pay huge transport and child care costs and to suffer disruption to their families. They pay a high and unacknowledged price for the right to work.  The Minister of State has been involved in this issue.  I hope her influence and that of other Deputies on the other side will help to secure a positive and balanced approach to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> The Minister of State has also been involved in the issue of carers, who are underpaid and have been scandalously taken for granted.  The crushing burden they carry, unpaid in many instances, has helped to ensure that revenue in the economy is so buoyant.  My colleague, Deputy Browne, raised some of the difficulties in recognising the support we should give the disabled.</P>
    <P>Carers contribute to a social policy that allows them to continue to care for their parents and relatives who need it.  The carers association has recommended that tax relief be extended to include care costs for parents, siblings and children. At present, relief is confined to care for oneself and one's spouse.  The Minister should look at this before Committee Stage.  It would have huge implications inside and outside the home and for the future of labour and the status of this kind of care in society.</P>

      <P>There is always a dramatic contrast between the enthusiasm with which the Government parties share accolades on the budget and the Finance Bill and the scepticism expressed by the Opposition parties.  It never ceases to amaze me how two different groups, having access to the same kind of information at the same time, can draw such differing conclusions. Doubtless it is the nature of our business; it is the way things always have been and the way they always will be.  I am sure it will not surprise the Government that this Bill, which gives statutory effect to the provisions of the budget, will be remembered for its failure to grasp and deal with problems and to address issues requiring attention.</P>
      <P>It will be unprecedented if the financial strategy and fiscal policies &mdash; including the provision of tax incentives to those who are better off and the attempt to wind up the top end of the economy &mdash; now being pursued at a time when the economy is booming are successful because such an approach has not worked in any other jurisdiction. The position will be clear within the next one to three years.  Similar policies when pursued in the UK in 1987 ended in failure.  I hope that does not happen here because we cannot afford the luxury of such a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should have addressed the issue of stamp duty, on which my party put forward proposals, especially with regard to second hand or previously occupied houses.  There is a housing crisis, which is not reflected in the budget provisions or the Bill.  Nobody appears to care or to know how to deal with the problem.  At least 25 people seek to buy every house that comes on the market, be it local authority or privately built.  It has been argued that more houses would be on the market if they were not rented.  That is illogical <Col N="1071" /> because it is immaterial whether a house is rented or owned by the occupant.</P>
    <P>I am unable to see how anybody earning less than £25,000 a year can attempt to take out a mortgage.  Allegedly, much time and effort has been put into the provision of incentives for the unemployed.  It is futile and half hearted to pretend such incentives work if we cannot continue them for those in employment.  There are two options &mdash; I have seen this in my constituency &mdash; open to first time house buyers earning the average industrial wage or less.  They can become unemployed, which may give them a chance to get a house, or they can leave the country.  No attempt has been made to address this problem in the budget or this Bill.  While the Government parties bask in the reflected glory of the Celtic tiger, I cannot understand why they will not consider the plight of this group of people.  It may not be too late to introduce amendments which would create incentives to provide housing targeted at this group.  Failure to do this will exacerbate the crisis.  There is no point in Ministers making oblique references to the matter if something is not done about it.  Action and intervention is required.</P>
    <P>The issue of respite care and residential care for people with disabilities must be considered. The Minister of State is aware of the extent of the problem which has been identified and growing for the past ten years.  Deputies on the other side identified it when they were in Opposition. The problem demands immediate attention.  The number of places deemed to be necessary a few years ago are far short of what is required today. They would not even make a dent in resolving the problem.  The parents, brothers, sisters and other family members of people with disabilities who have cared for them are finding it increasingly difficult to cope and to get a respite.  Given the rampant Celtic tiger their situation should have been addressed.</P>
    <P>Neither the budget nor this Bill have recognised cases involving couples who have entered mortgage agreements but who subsequently break up with one of the partners leaving the family home.  Previously under the Social Welfare Act and the supplementary welfare Act it was possible for that person to hold on to her home for her family because she received supplementary support from the health board.  However, that is no longer possible because there has been a gradual whittling away of her entitlement.  If she were to sell her house and leave her children homeless, under the supplementary welfare Act she could get the health board to pay 80 per cent of the rent on a private house, but she cannot receive that allowance for the house she is in at present.  I do not understand why that discrimination exists, particularly in respect of married women.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I thank Deputies Barnes and Durkan for sharing their time with me.  Any Member could speak for 30 minutes on the Finance Bill.  I wish to raise two matters, one of which was raised by my namesake, Deputy Browne, about disabled drivers.  It is incredible that a wonderful incentive introduced to help disabled drivers should be hijacked by red tape.  A disabled driver in Carlow, who has two artificial legs and who qualified on medical grounds for a disabled driver's special allowance, will not be given that allowance because of car insurance being in his father's name.  That is for <Col N="1073" /> purely financial reasons.  It involves a saving of £500 because the person concerned is young.  If he were to take out insurance in his name he would be fleeced.  As the car is insured in his father's name that person, who has two artificial legs, is not regarded as qualifying for a disabled driver's special allowance.  That is outrageous.  I have done my best to highlight this case and I will contact the Minister of State, who has a special interest in this area, about this.  It is time such red tape was removed.</P>
      <P>I question economic thinking in the Department of Finance.  I am not blaming the Minister in this regard.  The Department of Agriculture and Food has tried to raise standards in meat plants.  It advised meat plants around the country to upgrade their buildings.  Ballon Meats in Carlow spent £1.5 million upgrading its plant and it received clearance last November that it had reached the required standard.  That private plant is run by a successful and hardworking small businessman.  The plant was due to receive an export licence, but that has not been issued because the Department will not appoint a vet due to a cap on appointments.  As a result that meat plant cannot export meat to foreign markets.  A firm in Italy wants to buy meat from that plant and instead of working out details of the amount of meat he could export the owner is worried about whether he will have to give notice to his workers.  He cannot live on fresh air.  He invested his money in upgrading his plant and the Department of Finance has been penny wise and pound foolish in its approach.  A small businessman was encouraged to spend £1.5 million upgrading his plant, the Department of Agriculture and Food approved a grant to assist him in that work and now it will not appoint a vet which may involve a cost of £40,000.  That businessman could make money for the country, keep his workers employed and buy beef from farmers, but the Department of Finance believes it makes economic sense not to appoint a vet.</P>
      <P>Fair Oaks Meat Plant in Carlow has requested that an agricultural officer be appointed.  The local office has one permanent and three temporary agricultural officers who work according to the demand.  The Department of Finance has refused to make an appointment and because of that we are losing money hand over fist.  As a result of that 60 workers will be let go shortly and then the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will have to pay those workers unemployment benefit which would cover the cost of appointing a vet.</P>
      <P>How does the Department consider it sensible not to appoint a vet to oversee work in a meat plant where £1.5 million has been invested in upgrading its facilities?  A firm in Italy is seeking orders from the plant which it cannot meet because a vet has not been appointed to give the meat clearance.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Belton.</P>

I hope County Longford will be included in the rural renewal scheme for the upper Shannon. That has been called for over a number of years and it would be an incentive for the area. That scheme operated in some seaside resorts and it is only right that areas of the midlands along the Shannon should be included.  They suffer from flooding and any incentive for that area must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why County Longford has been excluded from the hotel incentive scheme, an issue I raised with the Minister on budget day.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Finance Bill which gives effect to, among other provisions, the budget tax cuts.  It confirms by way of legislation the reduction by two percentage points in tax rates for one million taxpayers, resulting in substantial increases in take home pay for PAYE workers from 6 April next.  The Bill also contains many technical and other changes to our tax law. The first part of the Bill deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>Section 37 proposes changes to the self-assessment system which will align the paying and filing dates on 30 November each year, beginning with 30 November 1999.  These proposals were first put forward by the Revenue Commissioners early in 1997, following a report in the media.  There was a spontaneous negative reaction from a number of accountants and in light of these responses the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland undertook a survey of all practising members.  Of 426 completed returns received from individual members and firms, 371, or 87 per cent, indicated they could not support the Revenue proposals, while only 55, or 13 per cent, indicated support. A similar response was given by both big firms and small firms.</P>
      <P>The reasons given for this significant opposition were, first, the proposals will effectively reduce by 40 per cent the normal period of September to January available to the self-employed and their tax advisers for the preparation of income tax returns; second, accountancy firms are under-resourced during July and August due to holidays and exam leave, which will mean additional pressures in all offices and severe pressure in those where the majority of clients are self-employed tax payers; third, the changes would not ease the Revenue's difficulties with peak levels of work at particular times &mdash; establishing an early filing date will only make the problem worse; and, fourth, other matters in the self-assessment system require urgent attention and should be given priority.</P>
      <P>The institute, in its submission to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, suggested this provision of the Bill should be deleted.  The Minister for Finance, in his Second Stage contribution, indicated he would make the relevant section subject to a commencement order in order to iron out problems and allow for a fuller impact assessment to be made before going ahead.  The institute believes it will not be possible to conduct a proper impact assessment while the provision remains on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute's opposition to this proposal is shared by the Irish Farmers' Association and the Small Firms' Association.  The institute requested the joint committee to give it an opportunity to make an oral submission in which its members would be able to brief the committee on the practical difficulties the proposal would create for 250,000 self-employed persons &mdash; including farmers, company directors, etc.  &mdash; their tax advisers and agents, and the Revenue.  On this matter, I <Col N="1076" /> have been approached by a sole practitioner.  The composition of his clientele is approximately 90 per cent self employed clients and 10 per cent corporate clients.  The self employed clients use either the calendar year or the tax year as the basis for their accounts.  At present, he schedules the work over a 12 month period to ensure staff have a regular volume of work to attend to.  If all accounts were prepared and filed by 30 November he would have no work for his staff in December and January as work would not commence again until February.</P>
    <P>Meeting clients, consulting with them and advising them on the payment of preliminary tax in October is a major assignment.  He normally devotes the last two weeks of each October to arrange the payment of preliminary tax.  Bringing the two deadlines together would make for an impossible situation.</P>
    <P>At present he has monthly deadlines for PAYE/PRSI returns, bimonthly deadlines for VAT returns, and annual deadlines for the payment of preliminary tax, filing tax returns and the payment of the balance of tax due.  In addition, he has corporation tax deadlines and filing deadlines for company accounts.  Furthermore, he has a plethora of compliance requirements under the tax legislation, company law, the insurance Acts, the Investment Intermediaries Act, institute regulations and so on.  I appeal to the Minister to look again at section 37 and to take into account the submission he received from the Institute of Chartered Accountants.</P>
    <P>There is a technical measure in section 39 in the Second Schedule of the Bill to deal with the proposed introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999.  The Government has decided to set out these changes well in advance of that date so that firms and their advisers will be clear on where they stand.  This is consistent with the clear and organised euro campaign which the Government has undertaken to prepare the ground for the changeover.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Foley for sharing his time with me.  The budget was the mainstay of the proposals of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, since we came into office.  It has been broadly welcomed by most people.  It is amazing that the Opposition has acquired selective amnesia when it comes to debating the Finance Bill.  The vast majority of people outside this House have broadly welcomed the provisions in the budget which are being cast in legislative stone in this Bill.</P>
      <P>For example, the major increases in personal allowances plus the reduction in the tax rates have been welcomed by all sectors of society. More than £5 million has been given in tax cuts to the PAYE sector &mdash; a hard pressed group for many years &mdash; and this has been very well received outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The falling rate of unemployment will give greater leeway to the Minister for Finance in the years ahead.  It is very short-sighted of some <Col N="1077" /> people to comment on the budget and the Finance Bill in isolation.  This is a four year programme. The Government plans to introduce many other proposals, as the Minister outlined in his budget statement in December.  Taking the budget and the Finance Bill in isolation does not do justice to the Government's work programme, the Minister for Finance or the many people who have applauded the budget.</P>
    <P>However, we must be conscious of the issues which people face.  While we talk about the Celtic tiger and the rapid growth of the economy, it is very evident that young people who are trying to purchase houses face huge problems.  This issue was raised by Members on both sides of the House at today's meeting of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government. It will have to be addressed immediately to ensure young people can purchase a house and meet their mortgage commitments.  Even couples on good incomes are finding it extremely difficult to purchase a house on which they can comfortably make the mortgage repayments.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, must assess what can be done to achieve a balance and allow young people the opportunity to purchase a house with reasonable repayments and make a start in life.</P>
    <P>This has a knock-on effect as it forces more people onto the public housing list.  We must acknowledge that a problem exists in that regard. The Minister for Finance must commit extra resources to public housing in coming years.  This is a daily problem for all Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Opposition castigated the social welfare measures in the budget, although I am at a loss as to why.  When the Rainbow Coalition sat on this side of the House it increased social welfare payments by paltry amounts.  The Minister for Finance has made provision for substantial increases for those dependent on social welfare. Old age pensioners, who served this country well for many years, fell far behind for a long time. The Commission on Social Welfare made recommendations in this regard to various Governments over the years.  At long last, that has been recognised and the benefits of the Celtic tiger have been passed on to those who have served the nation well.  Admittedly, every Member would like to see further improvements in social welfare payments.  However, this is a part of a programme under which over the next few years all social welfare payments will be far in excess of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>It is timely to examine the rates of pay to social welfare recipients.  The Commission on Social Welfare was established at a time of high unemployment, negative growth rates and massive emigration and against the backdrop of a pessimistic economy.  However, as we surge forward to the next millennium, it is timely to ask the Commission on Social Welfare to review the rates of pay as there is a discrepancy between those on <Col N="1078" /> social welfare and those on medium to high incomes.  A number of people are genuinely and actively seeking work but are still finding it difficult to be part of the new, powerful economy which has been created because they do not have the right qualifications or must join a training programme waiting list.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on the provisions in the Bill which I know will have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">

      <P>The Finance Bill is one of the most important legislative measures enacted by the Oireachtas each year.  The decision by the Minister for Finance and the Government to provide £500 million in personal tax reductions for all income levels is to be welcomed.  Contrary to what might be said on the Opposition benches, I know from canvassing in north Dublin that those taxation proposals and reforms have been greatly welcomed by the public.  There are many other positive features in this forward looking Bill.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on its introduction.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome the decision announced in the Budget Statement to establish a pilot rural renewal initiative for the upper Shannon region. This extremely important measure is targeted at areas which need investment and development and which have lost population over the years. The NESC report No. 102, published earlier this year, indicated very clearly that Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Mayo need particular attention. I am glad the Minister has decided to introduce this pilot scheme which will be of the utmost importance to my county of Cavan.  I appeal to the Minister, and his officials, to include all parts of County Cavan in that initiative.  All areas of the county need development.  It is one of the Border counties that has suffered immeasurably in the past 27 years due to the severe political troubles on our doorstep in the province of Ulster.  All Members hope those days of violence and disruption are behind us and that it will be possible to attract inward investment to the southern Border counties.  This is much needed to create jobs that will underpin the process.</P>
      <P>Governments of all political hues and various State agencies under different names gave stock responses to public representatives that it was not possible to attract inward investment and jobs to counties Cavan and Monaghan because of the unfavourable political climate that existed on our doorstep.  Now that era is behind us, I appeal to the Government, and particularly the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to target the area for special attention. There has been considerable and welcome inward investment in Ireland in recent years.  Unfortunately, none of it has come to the area I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in replies to Adjournment Debates and parliamentary questions I tabled, stated that she and the Government recognised the need for special attention for the Border <Col N="1079" /> region.  I am glad the Minister for Finance, when introducing his budget, stated that the pilot scheme would be aimed at stemming population decline and putting in place the necessary incentives to attract inward investment that will create jobs to ensure people remain in the area.  This is particularly important and I appeal to the Minister and his officials to include all parts of County Cavan in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The NESC report referred specifically to the relatively unorganised nature of counties Cavan, Roscommon, Mayo and Leitrim, their high dependency ratios and the counties' failure to attract inward investment.  The report stated that these counties experienced extreme forms of marginalisation. This welcome step by the Minister is much needed and other measures will be required to attract inward investment to these counties and County Monaghan.  Jobs and improved infrastructure are needed.  I, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other Fianna Fáil public representatives have at every opportunity outlined the specific problems the area faces as a result of the lack of proper infrastructure and the need to invest heavily in this area.  There is a need to put in place facilities to help attract inward investment to the counties that will create jobs and stem the population decline that, unfortunately, the counties are still experiencing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to review the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  It should put in place an adequate scheme to ensure farmers who want to install proper pollution control facilities on their holdings receive grant assistance to make that possible.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in this day and age a large number of people have inadequate accommodation, particularly elderly people in urban and isolated rural areas.  Their houses lack basic facilities and I appeal to the Government to advance plans to ensure that everybody lives in the decent and proper houses they deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of the budget and the Finance Bill, Fianna Fáil can state that it keeps its promises.  The party received a mandate from the people to whom it is answerable to ensure that the commitments made before the election are met during the Government's lifetime. Regarding taxation, Fianna Fáil stated in its manifesto that the top and lower levels of tax would be reduced.  Each was reduced by 2 per cent in the budget.  The Government has effectively put money into people's pockets.  They have been given a little more spending power which will alleviate hardship.  I challenge the Fine Gael Party in relation to the middle income group.  It does not want it to have the tax breaks it received from the Government because it failed miserably during its time in office to ensure middle income earners received anything worthwhile or meaningful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to blow the myth that this is a Government or budget for the rich.  Fianna Fáil has been <Col N="1080" /> conscious of the elderly during all its terms of office.  It is the only party that consciously acknowledged the major contribution of elderly people to society in the past.  For example, the free electricity, free travel and free telephone schemes were introduced by excellent Fianna Fáil Ministers.  Anybody who states it was a budget for the rich is not dealing with reality.  Under the budget, everybody will receive a 3 per cent increase.  Nobody mentioned that carers who look after the elderly will receive an increase of £5. The elderly richly deserve to be looked after and the caring Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has ensured that carers, who spend time looking after these people who contributed so much to society, will receive a small increase. This will give them some comfort and it acknowledges their excellent work.  Nobody mentioned that pensioners over the age of 75 will receive a free companion pass.  All Members who deal with the elderly are aware that a stage comes when old people are unable to travel alone.  The caring Minister for Finance has ensured that somebody can travel with them at no extra cost.</P>
    <P>It is important to consider other aspects of the Bill.  Child benefit, family income supplement and the widow's and widower's pensions have been increased by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance. It is important to debunk the myths and to counter the electioneering campaign that has been run by the Opposition.  Democratic Left criticised the budget but it should be remembered that Deputy De Rossa when he was Minister for Social Welfare gave the elderly the price of a box of matches a week in his first budget.  That is the caring attitude Democratic Left and the rest of the Opposition show towards the elderly.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned the reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent. A reduction to 20 per cent will regenerate activity and ensure that an increasing number of people will be willing to trade up and provide a continuing stimulus to the economy.  The more activity that exists, the more the Exchequer will gain. Unfortunately, Democratic Left, the Labour Party and Fine Gael have long forgotten about checks and balances.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of land for the development of houses and Opposition Members said much about the rezoning of land.  However, everybody must admit now that not enough land was rezoned.  This shows the ingenuity Members can display when in Opposition.  Labour Party, Democratic Left and Fine Gael Deputies said in the past that the rezoning of land was wrong. However, they must admit now that not enough land has been rezoned and young people cannot afford the price of new homes.  This is the type of backward thinking shown by these parties.  They were never any good for the country anyway and they never showed any forward thinking.</P>
    <P>Families have a difficulty when their land is rezoned for development.  For example, if a family has owned land for the past 30 years, it should not be regarded as development land because <Col N="1081" /> they are not speculators.  They have owned and worked the land over many years.  Many of these people are not willing to pay 40 per cent of the money they receive in capital gains tax.  We must look at this issue and give some acknowledgement to people who have owned land for so long.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Foley for sharing his time.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on his first Finance Bill.  The budget was well received by most sectors of society.  It was one of the most innovative budgets of modern times and I look forward to the next four budgets which the Minister will introduce.</P>
      <P>I welcome the £500 million given in personal tax reliefs.  We will all feel the benefits of these in little over a month.  Despite the ongoing debate about whether it is better to widen the tax bands, increase the tax free allowances or reduce the level of taxation, the man on the street has given a warm welcome to these reliefs.  The reductions will benefit all levels, including the lower paid and the elderly.  It has been stated that the reductions will also benefit those on higher pay, but what is higher pay?  Is it £30,000, £40,000 or £50,000?  In our tax regime, one does not need to receive a massive income to be regarded as earning higher pay.  Anyone on higher pay and in compliance with the tax system is entitled to share in these reliefs.  A distinction has to be made between the higher paid and the super rich. The Minister addressed this issue in his Budget Statement, with the aim of ensuring that the super rich pay an equitable proportion of tax.</P>
      <P>No party or person can claim an absolute right to represent the poorest sections of society. However, the evidence shows that Fianna Fáil always cared for the less well off.  It will continue to look after these people.  My party aims to represent all sections of society and the all-inclusive approach adopted in the Finance Bill is the fundamental principle on which it and the Government are built.  We would all like the lower paid to benefit more but this cannot be achieved without a fundamental reform of the tax and social welfare systems.  I urge the Minister to progress the review of these systems as rapidly as possible as the existing anomalies are a major contributor to poverty, social alienation and discrimination. We are fortunate to have a Minister for Finance of the calibre and ability of Deputy McCreevy. If anyone is capable of leading and driving this necessary reform then it is he.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has come in for some criticism for reducing the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  It has also been accused of being soft on the rich.  This is a smokescreen erected by the Opposition parties to hide the good in this change.  The ordinary man on the street who has a few pounds to invest will benefit from this change.  Companies which accrue large capital gains from the disposal of shares or from property transactions are subject to corporation tax rates, not the 20 per cent rate.  It is misleading <Col N="1082" /> to say that the Government is giving in to the super rich by introducing this change.</P>
    <P>The elderly will benefit from an important provision which is not usually commented on.  I am referring to section 17 which introduces enhanced capital allowances for the construction, extension or refurbishment of approved nursing homes. Those involved in community affairs and members of health boards are aware of the lack of proper care facilities for the elderly.  We talk about care for the elderly but in Limerick Regional Hospital male and female patients are required to share the geriatric ward.  This is not right and it must be rectified in the near future.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Health and Children.  The problems in this sector are causing enormous worry and pressure for those requiring nursing care and their families and relatives. The increasing age profile of our society and other issues such as changes in family structures, security, etc., have fuelled the demand for nursing homes.  The provisions in section 17 should go a long way towards ensuring that more places are available and that the quality and standard of accommodation and care are acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed enthusiastically on many occasions the £5 increase given to old age pensioners. I look forward to the increases in the next four budgets which will bring the rate up to £100 per week.  Many of my constituents who have benefited from the increase have expressed their appreciation to me, and I pass this on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have received representations about the housing problem.  Deputy Durkan referred to the housing crisis.  I do not know where this crisis is because if one visits east or west Limerick one will see large numbers of people buying houses. Deputy Durkan also referred to the stamp duty paid on second hand houses by first time buyers. The statement released by auctioneers and valuers last week does not support the points made by him.</P>
    <P>I have also received representations on the extension of the opening hours of betting shops. The Minister has a grá for this industry and I ask him to look again at this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Farrelly.  During the debate on the Book of Estimates I said that the thumb prints of the four Progressive Democrats Deputies were all over it.  Their thumb prints are also all over the Finance Bill and the budget.  The tax reliefs given in the budget will benefit the well to do and those who have gained most from the booming economy. The underclass, the underbelly, have not got their fair share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day the Minister had £520 million to hand out, yet the weakest and most vulnerable in society were once again told they would not get their fair share.  If one looks at the proportional increases in incomes in the budget one will see that the well to do supporters of the Progressive Democrats did very well.  The Government will <Col N="1083" /> rue the day it introduced the budget and the Finance Bill which have the thumb prints of the four Progressive Democrats members of Government.</P>
    <P>There is now a clear choice in this House between one set of parties which supports changing tax rates to reform the tax system and another set of parties which wants to widen the tax basis and in particular change the tax allowances. There is a clear choice of tax policy for the electorate not only in elections which will come in the next few weeks but also in a general election in the next few years.  More fundamentally, the social partnership which has been developed in recent times will be severely challenged in the years ahead as a result of this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Debate on the budget and the Finance Bill were, in two areas, taken over by the mistakes which the Minister made in trying to tax the old age pensioners on the few pounds they had saved in the credit unions.  It is ironic to think that only a year ago the Members opposite were complaining about the then Government only giving pensioners an increase of £1.50 per week and now they want to take away pensioners' savings.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague that the lower paid received very small allowances in the budget. When one considers that people on £12,000 and £15,000 gained by about £3 per week and people on £30,000 gained by £15 or £18 per week, this is an unfair division of the spoils of the Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not addressed in the Finance Bill an item which we raised here at the time of the budget, that is the exclusion of certain areas from allowances for hotel development, especially areas in counties which do not have hotels for the tourism industry. That would have benefited a substantial number of people who want employment.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed also to hear that a report is being undertaken about the price of houses.  I could tell the Minister a thing or two about the price of houses and why they are so expensive, if anybody on the Government benches cares to ask those of us who are involved in the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply annoyed that there is no proposal to give 50 per cent of the increased capital gains tax receipts on land which the Government is receiving from development land to a fund for local areas to avoid a shortage of facilities, particularly children who will grow up in these estates. There is a need to concentrate one's efforts in trying to ensure that, along with rearing their children, the people in these estates do not spend all their lives looking for lottery money for facilities from the Government of the day.  There is so much money being collected in capital gains tax in these developments that 50 per cent of it should be left in a kitty and returned to the local authorities to provide services.  If such a policy was implemented, we might save substantial moneys in the long-term on other services which might have to be provided later because children <Col N="1084" /> did not have the facilities they required as they grew up.</P>
    <P>The proposal my party tabled in connection with stamp duty on second hand houses is a worthwhile one, despite what some of the professional auctioneers have said in recent days. Their statement referred to house prices of over £200,000.  The reality is that no first time buyers will be purchasing houses at such prices.  There would be a very positive response from first time buyers who want to buy houses between £75,000 and £85,000.  If research was undertaken, it would prove that proposal would be very beneficial to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for sharing his time with me.  It will be interesting to see if the Minister intends making any changes to the Finance Bill other than those made prior to his coming into the House following its publication.  There were plenty of gaps which still need to be filled.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on one matter, the allowances for hotels in Border areas.  Unlike my colleague, Deputy Farrelly, the measure suits the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and me.  Our constituencies will get some benefit from it.</P>
      <P>What happened on Saturday night in the Hotel Hillgrove, where a bomb scare put all the people out on the streets, shows that we can do good in this House but those who want to ruin our country can do so with bombs and the threat of bombs. That can do a great deal of damage.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's U-turn on the credit union issue.  I would hope he would do the same on the issue of bringing forward the date for auditors, which will cause problems in the audit area and with the self-employed.  I ask the Minister to look at that issue closely.</P>
      <P>The other matter I would ask the Minister to look at even at this late stage is carers for the elderly and the carer's allowance.  There has been some movement in recent years in that area, but there is not enough available for those groups. Incentives must be given to allow us to build better homes for the elderly in the private or public sector because it is a growing problem with which we, as public representatives, must deal.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in some areas of agriculture due to a shortage of staff.  I want to make sure that the Department of Finance does whatever it can to alleviate that, and allows schemes and other issues to be dealt with in a prompt and proper manner.</P>

      <P>I am most grateful for the many contributions which have been made on Second Stage.  Most of those have concentrated on a selected number of themes or points in the Bill.  There have also been comments and reports on the Bill by several interested bodies outside the House.  Some of these comments have been measured; others, unfortunately, have not been so.  I will come to these later.  I am used to robust discussion, to a fair amount of give and take, and to reasoned argument.  I would hope in my reply to redress the balance in the discussion of a number of items in the Bill and to show that there are two sides to every argument, not just the one which is promoted the loudest or without challenge in the media.</P>
      <P>The main spokesmen opposite have characterised the 1998 budget as a budget for the rich, as a lost opportunity and inappropriately focused on cutting rates rather than bands or allowances.  All this depends on what one terms &ldquo;rich&rdquo;, as pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, in his remarks.  A cut in the top rate of tax cannot be characterised as a sop to the rich. Single people on £14,000 per annum pay at the top rate.  Married couples on £27,000 and over are on the top rate.  Are these rich?  On the other hand, l have cut back on tax shelters which allow high income professionals to reduce their tax bills substantially by investing in certain tax-favoured properties.</P>
      <P>For income earners such as these the extent of some tax breaks makes talk of reducing tax rates versus increases in bands and allowances somewhat academic.  When we talk about rates versus bands, etc.  we are often talking about whether someone on £12,000 per annum will gain a little more at the expense of someone on £15,000 per annum.  That is hardly the great debate on rich versus poor.  I do not suggest the Opposition spokesmen are not motivated by a genuine wish to seek a greater equity in the tax system, but let us keep things in perspective.  I welcome Deputy McDowell's comments on the generosity of some tax relief schemes, and the support of Deputies Noonan and Rabbitte for the moves to close off tax shelters.  I do not suggest that they wish to do other than what I want to do &mdash; to ensure that all taxpayers pay a fair amount of tax based on their level of income.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte warmed to the theme of a budget for the rich and quoted at length from the comments of the Conference of Religious of Ireland on the 1998 budget.  On the 1997 budget CORI stated:</P>
      <P>There is something profoundly wrong with a society where resources are growing dramatically yet it refuses to give priority to tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion. This is exactly what the Government has done in its Budget for 1997.</P>
      <P>Budget 1997 marks the triumph of greed over need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> This Budget aggravates the widening of the poverty gap.</P>
    <P>It further stated:</P>
    <P>A golden opportunity has been lost.  The divisions in Irish society will deepen as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>This year's budget raises serious questions about the commitment of Government to the Common Good.</P>

      <P>In case the Deputy has forgotten, budget 1997 was his Government's budget and that of the three parties opposite, but perhaps I should not be too hard on him.  CORI rarely compliments the budget unless it falls in with its view of what the budget should do.</P>
      <P>Taxation policy is a matter of political choice. The people ultimately decide in the ballot box how they will be taxed.  This Government had a mandate for its tax proposals in the budget which it got from the people last June.  I can hardly be faulted for doing what was promised at the election. I would have thought that keeping one's promises was something to be desired.  We can debate at length what is the correct tax policy but any such policy has to pass the test of public acceptability.</P>
      <P>One area of tax policy which has been sharply criticised is the cut in capital gains tax.  Deputy McDowell wanted to know who requested or lobbied for that change and asked me to provide a list of all those who made submissions for a change.  The main groups asking for a cut in capital gains tax were Forfás, the Institute of Taxation, IBEC and the Irish Stock Exchange. Deputy McDowell stated: &ldquo;It is a matter of public record that representatives of the Dunnes trust met officials of the Department some years ago and argued for changes in capital taxation&rdquo;.  He went on to ask if I or any of my officials met with or received submissions from representatives of the Dunnes trust.  I have not met representatives of the firm referred to in this matter.  Furthermore, there have been no discussions with officials since those that were held when Deputy Quinn was Minister.  Indeed, the then Minister for Finance gave an extensive reply to a question on these discussions which I put down on 8 December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general point touched on by some speakers opposite that I seemed to be following my own logic some people both inside and outside the House are of the view that Ministers for Finance, or any Ministers, should reflect the views of a great body of people or groups.  If that is what people believe a parliamentary democracy is all about, count me out.  I do not subscribe to the theory that the Minister of the day is a type of gigantic Hoover of all people's opinions and <Col N="1087" /> that he or she cannot take any initiative of their own.  Some Members of the House do not subscribe to that view.  They have displayed individual tendencies over a period of years, but if the new <i>raison d'e tre</i> of Irish political life is that Ministers should not take any initiatives of their own or put anything they believe in into effect, I do not subscribe to that view.  I did not subscribe to it in the past in any other Ministry or when I was on the back benches.  If politicians are elected to this House just to put forward everybody else's ideas, or those of lobby groups, without giving matters any analytical thought, I will not subscribe to that.  If Deputy Rabbitte wants to make a brief contribution I will listen to him, as I always do.</P>

      <P>I stated clearly that a number of bodies, including Forfás, have lobbied for a reduction in capital gains taxation.  As the Deputy knows, various bodies have lobbied over the years for reductions in capital gains taxation.  In the context of this budget, Forfás has lobbied for a reduction in capital gains taxation and it is the job of the Minister for Finance to make up his mind on that issue.  If the Deputy had read even a cursory note of what I said over the years he would know I have been of the view for a long time that a high rate of capital gains tax is ridiculous and that more money will be collected by the Exchequer in the long term by a lower rate of capital gains tax.  I am not saying that just because I am Minister for Finance.  That has always been my view and I have expressed it many times.</P>

      <P>I do not subscribe to the suggestion from the Deputy or anybody else that Ministers should be swayed by other people's views and do as they wish.  That is not my belief nor do I suggest is the belief of the majority of Irish people, and I make no apologies for saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of what was said in the Second Stage debate centred round the proposals on credit union savings.  I have no wish to open old wounds but it is important to be clear on this issue.  The point the Irish League of Credit Unions had difficulty with was the reporting of dividends over £500 to Revenue.  These dividends have been subject to tax for many years.  What they pressed for was complete exemption from income tax of the return from any shareholding less than £15,000 in a credit union.  This latter demand I refused to concede.  On dividend reporting, the measure I proposed would have affected only a very small number of account holders in a credit union.  To <Col N="1088" /> a large extent, I was doing what the credit unions asked for in proposing to introduce DIRT on deposit interest.  I was not, as Deputy McDowell sought to insinuate, reacting to pressure from the banking sector.</P>
    <P>Not all credit unions took exception to my proposals. The Honorary Secretary of one of the largest credit unions in the State has written to me thanking me for the proposals and stating that his credit union disassociated themselves &ldquo;from the vitriolic campaign orchestrated by the Irish League of Credit Unions against the changes proposed in the Bill on the taxation of credit union dividend/interest&rdquo;.  My proposals were described by the credit union in question as fair and reasonable given the current taxation position of individual credit union members and taking into account the new limits on credit union savings introduced in the Credit Union Act, 1997.  One might say that is a lone voice but I have reason to believe other credit union members share this view.</P>

      <P>The most loudly proclaimed view is not always the only view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has a great deal of experience of credit unions but if I had asked him for advice before I met the credit unions, I know the advice he would have given me at that time.  I am sorry I did not consult him before I agreed to meet them. Despite my invitation to Deputy Rabbitte on Second Stage to give his views, he declined to do so.  I take it from his silence on the matter, that would have been his advice.</P>
      <P>I plan to say no more on this issue but to proceed with setting up the working group I promised in my statement last week.  I share the views expressed by all Deputies on the great good done by credit unions for many people in the State and on the need for legislators to take that into account as appropriate in framing our laws on a fair basis.</P>
      <P>I had thought the proposed unification of preliminary tax payment and accounts filing dates, had been addressed by my commitment last Tuesday to include a commencement order to allow the proposal to go ahead when the practical difficulties expressed by some of the professional bodies had been ironed out.  I have received expressions of support for my proposal, which is seen as a progressive simplification of the tax system and the over-reaction it provoked in some quarters has been deplored.</P>
      <P>I was surprised, therefore, that the Institute of Taxation was still unhappy and claimed the proposal would lead to the collapse of the self-assessment system.  I regard this as alarmist and unwarranted. Let us keep matters in true perspective. We are speaking of moving forward by two months a deadline for submission of final accounts to Revenue.  A payment date is not being brought forward &mdash; the preliminary tax payment date would be put back by one month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1089" /> I am prepared to discuss this matter with the professional bodies to ensure any practical difficulties can be dealt with as smoothly as possible. If changes to the proposal are needed for this purpose, the commencement order approach will allow these to be made before the new provisions come into force.</P>
    <P>My attention was particularly drawn to one sentence in the statement by the Institute of Taxation as follows: &ldquo;No other issue has caused such concern amongst tax practitioners in living memory&rdquo;. I do not know if they have forgotten section 153 in 1995 and the upset that caused.  I would have thought, judging from the reaction then, that was a far more lively issue than self-assessment filing dates.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the proposal to extend the opening hours of betting shops.  I recognise the genuine concerns expressed by many Deputies on both sides of the House about the ramifications of this proposal.  In particular, I note the concerns expressed by Deputies Noonan, Power, Lenihan, Carey, Ring and others on the need for consultation with staff who will have to cover the extra hours.  I recently met representatives of the trade who asked that the section in the Bill should not come into effect until April 1999 and I will be happy to accommodate that request on Committee Stage.  What I am seeking to do is put the trading conditions of betting shops on a modern footing and to review the conditions on opening hours laid down 67 years ago in an entirely different era and society.</P>
    <P>A number of other specific issues were raised by Deputies in their contributions.  Deputy Noonan indicated that his party would put forward an amendment under which first time buyers of second hand houses up to a value of £100,000 would be exempt from stamp duty.  This, it was claimed, would be economically and socially desirable and would knock some steam out of the new house market.  No doubt we will discuss this suggestion on Committee Stage, but I note that the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute has come out against it and that the proposal attributed to Fine Gael was described by one property consultant in the media at the weekend as badly thought out and economically disastrous. The article went on to say that the proposal &ldquo;if implemented, would actually contribute to even more mayhem than usual at the very heated lower end of the second hand residential market&rdquo;. <Col N="1090" /> Perhaps the way to take the heat out of the market is to follow Deputy McDowell's proposal to apply stamp duty to new houses for everyone other than first time buyers.  This would, however, increase new house prices for those affected by anything from 6 to 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan proposed an increase in the tax free 15 per cent of income which taxpayers may invest in pension schemes and said that 15 per cent is not sufficient for a person at 30 years of age who wants to retire at 60 or 65.  The maximum amount of contribution that is tax deductible for a retirement annuity contribution is 15 per cent per annum or 20 per cent from age 55 onwards.  This is an issue in which I too am interested.  I am aware the Pensions Board will bring forward shortly a comprehensive report on private pension funding.  I will carefully study this report when it is finalised, but we must be careful in the action we take.  There is no absolute cash limit on the amount which one can put aside in any one year for a pension once the 15 or 20 per cent limit is not breached.  As pointed out in an article by a pension consultant in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of last Sunday, were it not that many self-employed cannot afford to make a contribution of 15 per cent of income in the early stages of their lifetime, such a limitation of 15 per cent might not inhibit the self-employed from providing for an adequate pension.  My aim would be to encourage and facilitate real pension provision and to plug the gaps which arise due to the new conditions in the labour market.  I am not in the business of allowing very generous amounts of tax free income to be put away under the cover of personal pension provision and, I am sure, neither is Deputy Noonan or any other Member of the House.  This matter was referred to in my budget speech.  It is an issue in which I am particularly interested and I will come back to it again. There are other matters with which I had hoped to deal, but I am sure we will have ample opportunity on Committee Stage to debate them further.</P>

      <P>Deputy Owen put the Fine Gael position on this Bill admirably in her contribution and I support what she said.  It is depressing, to say the least, that we have a need to discuss this matter in 1998.  Industrial relations should not require a Bill such as this.  Employers and employees should be capable of conducting their relationships as partners, each benefiting by the progressive action of the other.  The majority of the trade union movement must receive our praise.  It has progressed, responding to the changes in industrial relations which have occurred over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>The primary issue which has given rise to the presentation of this Bill is the dispute at Ryanair in which a number of employees are seeking the right to representation by a trade union.  We must congratulate Ryanair and its staff who have revolutionised air travel with competitive pricing which benefits the public.  Ryanair is one of the great successes in aviation.  It is sad to see this dispute dragging on.  Given the contribution of the staff to the company's success, are they not entitled to share in the fruits of that success?</P>
      <P>The chief executive of Ryanair appeared to reject the challenge of meeting with the professional negotiators, opting instead to carry baggage. All industrial and other relationships are a balance between the needs and desires of different agendas.  The executives of this high-flying company tell us their employees already have the benefit of the negotiation skills of SIPTU as Ryanair always pays a little more than union negotiated rates.  Is it the case that this is a good employer which pays more than its competitors and which is concerned that its employees do not squander the financial rewards of their labour on unnecessary expenditure such as union dues?  Is it the case that some employees of Ryanair do not realise how paternal their employer is?  We can only look on from the outside.</P>
      <P>The company seems to have an autocratic style. This is the same company which decided without consultation to reduce the level of commission paid to travel agents on the sale of Ryanair tickets, thereby undermining the business of every local travel agent and its employees and putting jobs at risk by reducing the viability of the travel agents' trade.  In short, it wanted to reduce the pay level while increasing the workload.  For what purpose was this done if not to increase the salary of the chief executive and to drive up the share price?</P>
      <P>I understand why Ryanair employees seek the comfort and protection of skilled negotiators.  The employees have a right to expect respect, a fair wage, reasonable rosters, some training and development to allow for progression and security of employment.  However, the Ryanair employees do not seem happy and I wonder why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Broughan for presenting this Bill.  Trade unions have made a major contribution to the country's economic progress, especially since the late 1970s when social partnership was developed.  Trade union members have made many sacrifices through difficult times and have often borne the brunt of pay restrictions, cut-backs, difficult working conditions and employment embargoes.</P>
      <P>The history of trade unionism from James Connolly to the present indicates that every trade union leader has gone through difficulties to enhance workers' pay and working conditions.  It is wrong to deny the right of trade union representation and membership, but it is equally wrong to have a compulsory trade union requirement. The Bill's timing is significant, coming as it does when baggage handlers at Ryanair have been denied their wish to be represented at the Labour Court by SIPTU.  It is unacceptable that Ryanair will not attend a Labour Court hearing to resolve these difficulties.  Ryanair's management is walking an industrial relations tightrope and, unfortunately, it is walking away from the mechanisms provided by successive Governments over many years.</P>
      <P>Why does Ryanair refuse to discuss the dispute in the Labour Court?  Does it intend to wreck the progress of the past 20 years whereby employers, workers and trade unions have worked in harmony? Ryanair is out of step with all other major employers and its actions will inevitably lead to its own destruction, unfortunately self-inflicted. Ryanair has been a good employer and has done much for air transport but it is important to note that over the past decade or so most other similar cases concerning trade union recognition were in the low pay sector, very often in the private sector. There is a lesson to be learned for all concerned. The voluntary nature of industrial relations and union membership must continue if social partnership is to survive.  If the Ryanair dispute and others about trade union recognition are not settled quickly, we will start down a road of confrontation and unrest.  Few employers, trade unions or workers want to follow it.</P>
      <P>The progress of the past decade cannot be lost because of the intransigence of a few insensitive employers, such as Ryanair.  Partnership has led to great success and if there is to be full involvement in maintaining progress in future, trade union recognition is necessary but it must be voluntary and acceptable to all parties.  It must never be forgotten that trade union involvement in the economic plans of the past decade was responsible for much of current day economic progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great need for an integrated contribution from workers, Government and employers.  Compulsory input into such a partnership makes it impossible to work.  Management requires skilled workers to produce quality output and support from all parties is essential for this success.  We cannot have a situation whereby the voluntary aspect of trade union membership is a disincentive to employers and we must be <Col N="1095" /> conscious of unemployed people and the possibility of future employment potential.</P>
    <P>The economy must always be competitive as multinationals in the past have left a very sour taste because of their sudden withdrawal from Ireland.  For example, Digital in Galway &mdash; we know what happened in the wake of its departure &mdash; and others put forward lack of competitiveness in Ireland as the reason for leaving for other low cost labour countries.</P>
    <P>Mandatory recognition will not help and could drive away possible investment, lose jobs and bring resentment to the fore.  Suspicion would replace partnership.  There are many good aspects to the Bill, but trade union membership must be voluntary and not compulsory at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Broughan, on introducing this legislation which is extremely timely and welcome in the context of the Ryanair dispute.  There are many contributory factors for which credit could be taken for the remarkable performance of the economy in the past decade.  However, there is a consensus that the single most important factor in transforming the economy and creating the much vaunted Celtic tiger has been the establishment of social partnership at national level.  It is a model being looked at by economies across the globe.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 is being enjoyed currently, the most recent in a series of consensus built programmes involving all elements and participants in the economy to work together with common objectives.  The common aim of social partnership is the advancement of the country but each component must advance so that it can turn to its membership and say social partnership is good for us.  The day that one partner feels the people it represents are not getting their fair share is the day social partnership will crumble.  This means putting workers and their legitimate representatives, the trade union movement, on an equal footing with the other sectors involved in negotiating partnership.  There must be equality of treatment and that basically is all that is required of the Bill.  It seeks to vindicate and establish in law the basic and vital reality that underpins our current economy, the right of workers to associate and have professional representation.</P>
      <P>There is much talk also of increased globalization in terms of capital and technology.  The social dimension of it has not been as advanced as economic developments over the past decade. I had the honour of representing the previous Government at a conference on world trade and its effect on the marginalised.  While the free movement of goods and services and the globalization of markets has huge benefit for those best able to participate, it can be very negative for those who are marginalised and not equipped to participate fully in the transformation of an economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> That can happen at two levels.  At international level, countries are beggared because they are not part of the evolving global economy and are even more marginalised than they were.  Within countries, sectors of the population can be marginalised and excluded from full participation in the fruits of economic growth and development. Social inequalities and injustices at national and international level must be addressed, but first they must be recognised.  There must be a champion or a representative to argue the case of those who are not getting their share of economic growth.</P>
    <P>The gravest threat to social partnership in Ireland is the ongoing assault on the trade union movement by Ryanair.  It is an assault not only on the rights of trade unions and individual workers over a principle which we thought was established decades ago &mdash; the right to associate and to be professionally represented &mdash; but also on the continued well-being of the nation, and every worker, organisation and business in it.  I am delighted the Tánaiste is present to participate in the debate but she should take seriously the increasingly voiced concerns of the trade union movement that assaults on its very right to exist undermine fundamentally the future of social partnership and, indeed, the very existence of the current framework, Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The attitude presented by Ryanair management is closer to the thinking of the 1920s than the declining years of the twentieth century. Much has been said about the management of Ryanair.  I do not intend to dwell on that.  I am more concerned about the principles of this Bill which mean the Government cannot be a disinterested bystander.  It must defend consensus and dialogue, the hallmarks of labour relations in recent times.  I read with concern the comments made in the House last week by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who said he was at one with the Taoiseach in regard to Ryanair.  What will he do about it?  It is all very fine to decry the inflexibility of that company, to laud the rights of workers to be represented and to encourage people to participate in the industrial relations mechanism aimed at dispute resolution, but a Government must do more than exhort.  It must be prepared to take specific and concrete action. According to the Minister of State's comments last week, the Bill introduces sanctions and is, therefore, unacceptable.  What can be done about a recalcitrant company that will not accept the basic rights of people?  It has always been the case that we should take sanctions against those who are out of step with the norm or the broad thrust of public opinion and policy.  Of course it is proper to take sanctions against those whose policies undermine the consensus upon which the common good is based.  The Minister of State said the Bill was ill-timed.  I cannot think of a better time to introduce it.  In the case of the Ryanair dispute, the will of the Oireachtas, the attitude of the Government and the resolution of all of us to <Col N="1097" /> maintain the partnership process upon which our well-being is based should be clearly displayed.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, gave a dissertation, an historic lecture about the origins of trade union recognition.  From my experience the single most significant political event that happened in Wexford this century was the 1911 lock-out, the repercussions of which are alive for the citizens of my home town and county to this day.  That dispute was about the right of workers to associate and negotiate, to be represented by a trade union.  It was a bitter and awful dispute and after six months of hunger the workers were forced to climb down and could not join the transport union.  They were beaten through starvation and went back to work. However, they overcame that dispute and founded their own local union which was a shadow branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union.  The resonance of that early struggle of workers to have rights is real in people's thoughts today, but they believed it was something they had left behind decades ago.  It is incomprehensible that a similar dispute could be faced today.</P>
    <P>From his comments in a press release rather than in the House last week, apparently the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, regards the Bill as oldfashioned, old rather than new Labour policy. When it comes to recognising the importance of partnership with the trade union movement and the role of workers in building and sustaining this economy, the Labour Party is, as always, consistently on the side of workers.  There is nothing about the Bill that represents old Labour.  It is a modern Bill that seeks to maintain consensus and does not force anybody to do anything.  It simply requires people to go through a just process and seeks to ensure that basic rights are not denied by any person using a dominant position to bully others.  We have come a long way from the days of the bullying employer who told workers how high they should jump and they obeyed.</P>
    <P>I am gravely disappointed at the attitude of Government Ministers and spokespersons on this matter.  The Tánaiste is in the House tonight. Since she has had a week to reflect on this matter, I hope the line taken by the Minister of State in her Department has shifted.  However, I am more hopeful than optimistic about that because the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Minister of State will probably be hardened by the Progressive Democrats senior Minister in the Department.</P>
    <P>Much depends on the outcome of the Ryanair dispute.  The Bill certainly addresses the issues involved in that dispute, but it applies to all disputes and not merely one that seriously threatens to undermine the partnership approach to growing our economy.  I do not want to hear the usual comments that the Bill is flawed or badly drafted. Flaws and drafting can be addressed.  We are talking about principles.  If the Tánaiste rejects the Bill, I want her to put forward her ideas on how to address the issue.  I do not want exhortation, I want to hear what measures the Tánaiste and <Col N="1098" /> Government propose to put in place to ensure the management of Ryanair accepts the normal working conditions of any business that operates within our economy.  I want to hear a rational and measured proposal to address this long-standing and bitter industrial dispute.  We cannot have it both ways.  It cannot be argued that what the Labour Party suggests is wrong but the objective of the Bill is right unless the Government has alternative proposals.</P>
    <P>This extremely important issue includes a number of fundamental concerns for workers.  There was a fair degree of resistance within the broad membership of the trade union movement to the last partnership deal.  That resistance will harden unless the Government shows itself to be fair.  In another agenda on another issue, the question of fairness and equality of treatment regarding participants in discussions is stressed again and again. On this issue there should be no equivocation. The rights of workers are clearly and deliberately being undermined.  The Government can neither be neutral nor a bystander, it must be involved.  I want to hear how the Tánaiste proposes to address this issue so that the trade union movement continues to be engaged in partnership.</P>
    <P>We brought two Bills before the House since the current Administration came to office, the legislation dealing with Sunday trading and the measure being discussed tonight.  On the first, the Government did a double somersault and voted down measures which the major component of Fianna Fáil proposed in the last Dáil.  The Government has an opportunity to redeem itself somewhat tonight by addressing the issues so well put by Deputy Broughan.  If not crafted to the degree the Tánaiste would accept, it is incumbent on her to bring forward her own clear concise proposals to deal with this important issue.</P>

      <P>The issue of trade union recognition is complex, difficult and sensitive.  If it was not, Deputy Broughan and his colleagues in the Labour Party would have introduced this Bill during their time in Government over the last five years.  It would be remarkable if Deputy Quinn, as Leader of the Labour Party, was to support legislation now which he refused to bring forward when he had ministerial responsibility for this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Labour was in office for 15 out of the past 25 years and on no occasion did it seek to promote this legislation.  Labour and Democratic Left Ministers held office at the Department of Enterprise and Employment during the last five years and did not seek to promote this legislation. There was no mention of trade union recognition <Col N="1099" /> in the Labour Party election manifesto at the last election.</P>
    <P>It is not as if the issue of trade union recognition arose only with the Ryanair dispute; it has been around for many years, but no Irish Government, of any stripe, has sought to deal with the problem by way of legislation.  It is an issue that has given rise to much passionate debate particularly in the past few years.  There is one important conclusion which can be drawn from this debate, namely, that legislation is not the answer.  It is contrary to all our traditions of voluntarism and free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Bill provides an appropriate or workable solution for industrial relations disputes.  If enacted, the Bill could lead to a deterioration in industrial relations.  Put at its simplest, legislation is not the way to resolve industrial relations disputes.  However, the Bill has served the useful purpose of allowing this House to air, in a frank debate, all the issues involved.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Broughan recognises the difficulties involved here.  In his contribution last Tuesday introducing the Bill he said: &ldquo;there is a long tradition of voluntarism in Irish industrial relations and a reluctance to resort to legislative solutions&rdquo;.  I fully agree.</P>

      <P>We must endeavour to maintain the voluntary approach which has served us well during the past 50 years.  We need to reflect long and hard before changing that system in the very fundamental way the Bill seeks to do.  There are many who doubt that the Bill is capable of resolving union recognition disputes.</P>
      <P>It is clear, in the context of our voluntary approach, any solution to industrial relations disputes must have the support of the social partners. The discussions in the high level group on trade union recognition, set up on foot of a commitment in Partnership 2000, offer the best prospect of finding a solution.  The group is representative of all the interests involved and has established some important principles.  For example, the primary focus should be on the resolution of disputes rather than on advancing any particular mechanism and we must find a solution within the present voluntary system of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The group submitted a report to me before the end of last year, as required under Partnership 2000.  However, more time is needed for reflection on the relevant issues and a further meeting of the group may be necessary.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation and the Government have agreed to finalise the work of the high level group.  It is essential to await the outcome of these discussions rather than take precipitate action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> We must not underestimate the difficulty involved in arriving at a solution that will be acceptable to the social partners as well as Government.  Many in the trade union movement recognise the enormity of the task.  This point was made within the trade union movement during the debate on the matter at the ICTU biennial conference last summer in Belfast.  Whatever about the study of this issue in the past months, it is fair to say that this Bill is being promoted now because of the dispute in Ryanair.</P>

      <P>Certainly they seem to have changed in the past six months.  I believe the Bill is being promoted because of the dispute in Ryanair.  However, we need to keep a sense of perspective and it must be appreciated that responding in this manner to situations such as the Ryanair dispute is not necessarily the best way forward.  For voluntarism to work it is essential that all the parties to the employment relationship abide by certain ground rules, even if these rules are not explicitly stated or have the force of law.  The essence of voluntarism is that where disputes cannot be resolved directly between workers and their representatives on the one hand and management on the other, the dispute is referred to a third party for conciliation or adjudication.  In practice, this means the dispute settling agencies &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Certainly in the case of Ryanair, all the labour relations machinery of the State is at the disposal of the parties involved.  It is a great pity that this machinery has not been availed of in this case.  If I thought that further third party intervention would be helpful, I would be prepared to look at the possibility of an independent inquiry under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>I have discussed the matter with the employers representatives, IBEC, and with the ICTU and the management of the company and if I believed it would resolve the dispute I would be pleased to act under the provisions of section 38(2).  I do not think we need always to look for a political decision as a means of resolving disputes of this sort.  There is no point in going down a particular road unless we are reasonably certain it will be helpful in terms of finding a solution.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and other speakers on the Government side have dealt in detail with the various flaws in the Bill.  I do not intend to rehash all the arguments, but I wish to mention some of the chief reasons I cannot support the Bill.  If enacted, the Bill would entail a radical change to the legislative framework in which our industrial relations machinery is conducted.  It would have serious implications for the functioning of the industrial relations agencies, the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>The Bill would diminish the effectiveness of the Labour Court by giving the court a quasi-judicial role which would almost certainly lead to litigation in industrial disputes.  The functions of the Labour Court have been firmly rooted in the voluntary approach and the principle of free collective bargaining.  The court has served us well for the past 50 years.  It enjoys the respect of employers and unions alike.  For instance, a survey conducted by the court in 1995 found that 84 per cent of its recommendations were accepted by the parties.  This is a measure of the stature of the court.  It is a position we should try to preserve and enhance, not jeopardise as this Bill seeks to do.</P>
      <P>The Bill would serve to bring the law into aspects of industrial relations where it has hitherto been largely absent.  It would introduce a degree of compulsion within the industrial relations systems which would represent a major departure from its essential voluntary nature.  It is likely to involve the Labour Court in litigation, which it has up to now largely avoided when dealing with industrial disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is likely to lead to mandatory procedures in other areas of industrial relations, something which neither employers nor trade unions would welcome.  Expert commentators have identified several difficulties associated with statutory union recognition procedures.  For example, Professor Beaumont of Glasgow University has highlighted the fact that we must acknowledge that mandatory recognition could be a double edged sword.  By this he meant that if we were to provide for mandatory recognition where the majority of employees in a company <Col N="1102" /> wish for it, we would also have to provide for the opposite where a majority of employees do not want to be part of a union.  Furthermore, the professor points to the fact that highly legislative and adversarial procedures will pose operational difficulties for the responsible administrative bodies and will risk the creation of adversarial collective bargaining relationships from the outset.</P>
      <P>A very important consideration to be taken into account when considering the union recognition issue is the impact any form of compulsion would have on foreign direct investment in Ireland.  We are heavily dependent on foreign investment.  Some 50 per cent of all of those employed in manufacturing and internationally traded services work in the foreign direct investment sector.  This is an aspect we cannot afford to ignore because too many jobs depend on this investment.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that changes in our current practices which might be perceived as moves towards mandatory trade union recognition would impact adversely and substantially on inward investment and consequently on employment throughout the country.  In particular, the consequences that mandatory recognition would have with regard to this country's primary standing in such key areas as electronics would be very damaging.  Most multinational companies chose not to recognise trade unions, yet they are among the best employers in the country.</P>

      <P>There is no hue and cry among employees in these companies for union recognition. This is the best example of the advantages of a voluntary approach on this issue.  When he was Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn did an excellent job in terms of attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland.  He would be the first to appreciate the effects this Bill would have on the national effort in this respect.  Over the past couple of months this has been one of the most frequent issues raised with me in my dealings with foreign companies.  The publicity generated by this debate has caused concern because American companies do not understand our culture.</P>

      <P>In this debate about union recognition we must not lose sight of the fact that Ireland has one of the highest levels of unionisation <Col N="1103" /> in the West.  We have not experienced the catastrophic decline in membership levels which some countries have experienced in the past 25 years.  At the end of 1996 total trade union membership was in the region of 540,000 representing approximately 53 per cent of all employees at work.  This is a very high density level by international standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>According to data published by the International Labour Office last year only 14 of 92 countries surveyed had trade union density rates in excess of 50 per cent.  Some countries, despite having statutory provisions for trade union recognition, have experienced long-term decline in union membership levels.  In the US, for example, which has had statutory recognition procedures since the 1930s, only 14 per cent of workers were union members in 1995.</P>
      <P>The voluntary approach to industrial relations represents a culture that has developed in this country, especially in the past 50 years.  It has served us very well and the social partnership of the past decade, which has contributed so much to the economic boom of recent years, is a product of that system.  It is a system we must maintain and develop and not fundamentally alter as this Bill would do.  We must find another solution to industrial relations disputes, one which is consistent with the voluntary approach.  The best prospect of finding that solution lies with the high level group established under Partnership 2000. We must await the outcome of its deliberations.</P>
      <P>The Deputies supporting this legislation, especially those in the Labour Party and Democratic Left, should not underestimate the damage this legislation can do to the reputation of this country.  I welcome the responsible approach adopted by the Fine Gael Party and by Deputy Owen, the Fine Gael spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment.</P>

      <P>They may think it is good politics, but many would not agree and I do not believe they will be thanked by anybody.  I have not heard anyone say that a solution can be achieved by prolonging a dispute that has been marked at times by bitter verbal confrontation.  I support the views of Deputy Quinn when he said that such problems must be resolved by both sides in dispute. He takes the logical viewpoint and recognises that it is impossible to force parties to a dispute to negotiate against the will of either party. I expect him to take this view and I hope his parliamentary colleagues will take a similar view.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an example of hasty and illresearched legislation which can be seen in the vagueness of its proposals.  The Bill proposes that the Labour Court will have the powers of legal enforcement against parties to a dispute.  In its highly successful history it has never needed such powers.  Those who mediate through it do not have to seek expensive legal advice.  The introduction of these legal powers would ensure that employers and would be employers toe the line.</P>

    <P>How would the Bill's proposers react if it were enacted and its powers were used against the trade union which did not accept a court ruling? Would they rush to introduce an amendment to ensure that such powers were to be used only against the employers?  How would parties to a dispute feel if their disagreement were prolonged by lengthy legal debate and, if at the end of such a debate, the ensuing recommendation were the <Col N="1105" /> subject of a counter legal argument?

      <P>We cannot legislate for a solution, we must arrive at one based on consensus and the best place to do that is at the Labour Court which has a defined role.  It has fulfilled its function with great success.  Its findings are based on its vast experience.  The Labour Court was set up by the Government in 1946 to provide a means whereby difficult industrial disputes could be sorted out.  Despite its name the Labour Court is not a court of law and its procedures are informal. The union side or the management side can take a case to the Labour Court and, in most cases, the outcome of a court investigation is a recommendation which is not legally binding. Neither side is compelled to accept the court's ruling but in the majority of cases the parties do accept the decision.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court consists of a chairperson, three deputy chairpersons and eight ordinary members, all of whom are appointed by the Minister for Labour.  Of the eight ordinary members, four are put forward by the employers' organisations and four by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Normally the court operates with three people, the chairperson or deputy chairperson, an employers' representative and a union representative.</P>
      <P>On the subject of trade union membership, page 69 of &ldquo;Understanding Trade Unions Yesterday and Today&rdquo; published in 1988 by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Will I have to join a trade union?</P>
    <P>Most workers have the right to join a trade union if they wish and the majority of them do.</P>
    <P>The right to join a trade union is protected by law and as a consequence you cannot be harassed or sacked from your employment just because you become a union member. Although it is in your interest to join a union, you are not compelled to do so except where a &lsquo;closed shop&rsquo; arrangement exists.  In such cases union membership is a condition of employment. This means that an agreement has been made with the employer that all workers in a particular place of employment will join a union.</P>
    <P>That approach has worked successfully for many years.  I do not see the urgent need for change that drives the Labour Party.  It did not show the same urgency while in power only seven months ago.  I can only assume it is seeking political opportunism.  As a new Member of this House, I want to say that will not wash.  I fully support the Minister's stand on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Flynn on his speech.  I have not heard him speak in the House before and I will address some of the comments he made.  I will disagree with him, but I hope to do so in a constructive manner.  We have different views, but we have a similar mandate. We have been elected by the people of this republic to this assembly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the Labour Court of which I have some knowledge.  He said it is the best forum in which disputes of this kind could be resolved.  I agree.  The wisdom and judgment of the members of the Labour Court and the jurisprudence it has accumulated since 1946 make it the best place in which a final decision should be made.  Am I correct in assuming that is the point the Deputy made?  I gather the nod from Deputy O'Flynn that he is arguing that case, that ultimately the decision should be made not by the Supreme Court, adversarial lawyers or head butting between employer and trade union representatives but by the accumulated wisdom of the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was set up by Seán Lemass in 1946 after a period of regulation and control of wages because of the war.  That tripartite body was appointed by the Minister on the nomination of employers' organisations and what was then two but is now one trade union organisation.  That body comes to a conclusion as to whether, given the circumstances, it should make an employment order under the 1946 Act.  That is not something we are proposing now, it is a statute that has existed since 1946, the year of my birth.  With 51 years of accumulated wisdom that body ultimately decides whether an employment order should be made in a particular case through the process Deputy Broughan outlined on behalf of our party.  This is not some knee-jerk political reaction but a studied <Col N="1108" /> and measured analysis of a problem that has been bubbling for some time.  The Labour Court and not the Labour Party, this House or the Supreme Court would determine whether to make an employment order.  In those circumstances what would it decide?  It would decide that, in respect of pay and conditions, a group of workers have the right to nominate a professional set of negotiators called a trade union to argue on their behalf.  That is the issue.</P>
    <P>Many people in this House on occasions need to defend their interests but they do not consider they have the necessary expertise.  I suspect Deputy O'Flynn can relate to that.  When sometimes faced with complex financial or legal difficulties, people require professional advice.  They are good at what they do.  They are good fitters, turners or aircraft manufacturers, but they may not be good at high finance or pension matters. Many business people who are good at property development, retailing or tourism may not be good on tax advice and other complex matters. What do they do?  They get professional advice from lawyers, accountants, tax consultants or human resource management assistance.</P>
    <P>What are the baggage handlers in Ryanair looking for today?  They are looking for professionals to advise them.  They want to know if they are getting the right deal.  We live in the world of the market economy.  We accept market society.  There is not a single businessman who would go into that market economy today without getting the best advice in negotiating or advisory terms on what he has to sell.  If one is a baggage handler in Ryanair, what is one's ability?  It is the ability to load and unload aeroplanes quickly and efficiently.  That is the commodity a baggage handler brings to the market economy. In this instance that category of worker has the right to appoint professional advisers to get the best deal for them.</P>
    <P>They do not have fancy titles; they are called a trade union.  It is probably not very fashionable today, but it might be more attractive to call them pension and life consultants or the association of the maximisation of market opportunities or any other title that might grace the pages of the advertising columns of <i>The Irish Times</i> business supplement on a Friday or the <i>Sunday Business Post.</i></P>
    <P>Why should business people and professionals have the right to get advice to ensure they are not selling themselves short, that they are looking over the ditch to the fourth field ahead, whereas workers cannot take advice in order to maximise the only thing in their possession to sell, their ability to work, to load and unload planes?  They want the right to be professionally recognised in order to do so.  That is what is at issue.  In response to Deputy O'Flynn, this was at issue in August 1913 when working men walked off trams across this city because they were refused precisely the same right.  In those days things went further &mdash; if one <Col N="1109" /> tried to have that right asserted on one's behalf one summarily lost one's job.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to give any support to the Labour Party's Trade Union Recognition Bill is disappointing but not surprising. Almost every decision taken by this Government since coming to office has benefited the wealthy in our society rather than workers.  This Government will go down in history as an Administration which clocked up a record number of U-turns during its short-term of office.  In a week when we have seen Fianna Fáil Ministers &mdash; from Deputy O'Rourke to Deputy Kitt, even the Taoiseach himself &mdash; criticise Ryanair management, it is pitiful that they cannot bring themselves to support the balanced measure before the House.  I emphasise that it is balanced because I am aware of the concerns expressed on the other side of the House and will address them.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, picking up on Deputy O'Flynn's comments, tonight's vote comes at a critical time.  We know the future of social partnership is in danger.  Even a cursory look at <i>Newsline</i>, SIPTU's in-house publication, reveals the depth of anger in that union at the behaviour of Ryanair management.  Contrary to the snide remarks of the Minister, Deputy Kitt, last week, that union fully supports this Bill and issued a statement refuting his suggestions.</P>
    <P>While serving in recent Governments as Minister for Finance and Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I never witnessed such a gross undermining of social partnership as I have in recent months.  Every couple of weeks, trade unions warn of frustration among members over the Government's inability to act decisively on the commitments made in Partnership 2000.  The December budget was a case in point.  Even though trade unions, members of voluntary and community sector groups and even some employers called for tax reform targeted at low and middle income earners, the Government ignored all this measured advice and did precisely the opposite by awarding the benefits of tax reform to those on the highest incomes.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that patience is wearing thin among workers but I am disappointed because I am fearful for the future.  The Government has shown contempt for Partnership 2000 by skewing tax relief towards the well off instead of directing it towards low and middle income earners.  It would do well to heed the warnings made by one of the social partners, otherwise Partnership 2000 will be seriously undermined if not destroyed &mdash; I say that reluctantly.</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises that workers have helped to create our booming economy.  Others have played their part also &mdash; risk takers in our society, the administrators in our public service and the international regime of low interest rates from which we have benefited considerably.  Everyone together has made sacrifices and compromises in the past and the workers deserve the chance to say how their workplace should be managed.  It is a payback of a different kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Contrary to what some Ministers have tried to state, this is not a mandatory Bill.  &ldquo;Mandatory&rdquo; is fast becoming a word the Government cannot handle.  It first wanted mandatory reporting of child abuse, then it did not want it, and now wants it again, but it does not want mandatory union recognition.  I am pleased to inform the Government that it is off the hook &mdash; the Bill does not include a mandatory recognition clause because to do so would be unconstitutional.  Whoever wrote Deputy O'Flynn's script missed that point. This Bill does not concern mandatory recognition, rather it provides a mechanism to allow for effective recognition of a union to represent workers' concerns on issues relating to pay and conditions.  If that is the only point on which the Government opposes this necessary legislation, the way is free for it to support it and, if it wishes, to amend any of its offensive sections on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, spoke on behalf of the Government in this debate.  This is the same Minister of State whose views are so respected by his colleagues that they were prepared to vote down his Bill.  Perhaps he is mistaken on this occasion.  Could it be that the Government intends to accept this Bill but has failed to inform the unfortunate Minister of State?  It appears, having regard to the Minister's comments, that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's speech opposing the Bill was a model of bureaucratic waffle.  Each of his points was wholly misconceived.  For instance, he claimed the Bill proposes mandatory recognition and compulsion whereas it encourages voluntary trade union recognition.  This is different to the position in the United States &mdash; a place of much concern to the Minister, Deputy Harney &mdash; where, if 51 per cent of workers in a plant so wish, they can demand and have redress under federal law to have unions recognised.  We are not proposing such a mechanistic approach to union recognition.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed the proposed role for the Labour Court would be quasi-judicial but it would be anything but that.  We would give the court two powers.  The first would be to make recommendations.  Is that quasi-judicial?  I would not have thought so.  The second would be to make an employment regulation order.  The court already has that power and has made such orders, where it sees fit or deems such an order is necessary, since 1946.  This Bill is the child of the late Seán Lemass, one of the vaunted heroes of the present Leader of Fianna Fáil.  If he is offside, where does that leave Fianna Fáil today?  The present Taoiseach was much in evidence at the launch of a celebrated and much respected biography of Seán Lemass, written by a former Labour Party colleague of mine, Mr. John Horgan.</P>
    <P>This is what we are attempting to do.  In one instance the Labour Court, at the end of a long, voluntary process of conciliation and discussion, can make a recommendation &mdash; hardly quasi-judicial. <Col N="1111" /> In the other, it can make an employment regulation order, which power it already possesses. Will that cause a crisis on Wall Street or close the IDA's operations in North America? Let us be realistic.  The hysteria from the Government beggars belief, especially since it is likely that more workers vote for Fianna Fáil than for Labour.  As Leader of the Labour Party, it is sad for me to put that on the record but it is a fact nonetheless.</P>
    <P>Where are the serried ranks of Fianna Fáil Deputies who receive trade union votes in general elections?  How out of touch can one get in seven months?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, said the Bill is ill-timed and tried the usual trick of querying what this side of the House did while in Government, to which I will return in due course.  He should know that as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and subsequently as Minister for Finance, I proposed or supported a wide range of labour legislation, including the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Protection of Young Persons Act and other legislation. However, much as I would have liked to, one cannot do everything in a five year Dáil period and the task of reform and change must go on.  In regard to the Minister of State's accusation, the Bill comes at exactly the right time.  It was drafted long before the Ryanair dispute hit the runway, let alone took off.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said the Bill will encourage litigation and that its provisions are vague and uncertain.  He clearly has not read the Bill. The reality is that the provisions to which he refers, and which determine whether a union is representative, are neither more nor less vague than many other Acts which deal with trade union consultation in specific contexts.  Many of those Acts were brought in by the Minister of State's colleagues.  Does he also accuse them of encouraging litigation?</P>
    <P>The Minister of State's selective and misleading account of the ballot provisions also takes no account of the related provisions in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, which have been in operation for a number of years.</P>
    <P>Sadly, I do not need to say much about Deputy Owen's analysis of the Bill because it was even more superficial than that of the Minister of State.  She queried section 8(2) and seems to be unaware this type of provision is common in labour law statutes.  She should read up on labour law before making facetious comments about the drafting of the Bill, which she repeated on Network 2 last Saturday.</P>
    <P>There is a timely obligation on this House to move forward on the issue of trade union recognition. I firmly reject the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on this Bill last week.  His selective references pulled from the days of my tenure as Minister for Enterprise and Employment do not hold any significance for this <Col N="1112" /> debate.  This Bill is a well researched document which was prepared by Deputy Broughan over some time, and in the full knowledge of the ongoing work between congress and other parties to the high level working group.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record my understanding of the history of events.  As we know, history is a very partial activity in which all of the participants to the same act have a slightly different view of the event.  My recollection and knowledge of the history is as follows.</P>
    <P>As we moved towards the end of the negotiations on the third partnership programme, the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, known as the PCW, one of the key trade union negotiators came to me &mdash; I was then the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, which Department is now known as Enterprise, Trade and Employment &mdash; with a proposal.  It was suggested that congress would put on the table a proposition whereby in return for some resolution of the thorny issue of trade union statutory recognition in certain cases, which were and are exclusively domestic disputes, such as the Nolan dispute, the Pat the Baker dispute and the legacy of Hanlon's ambulances in Longford, congress was prepared to offer, through the mechanism of what became known as the PCW, a no strike industrial peace clause for the duration of the programme.</P>
    <P>That proposal had my full support.  I was not a key negotiator in that programme because most of the negotiations were conducted out of the Department of Finance.  I encouraged the person involved whom I will not name.  That person has since moved on to other things.  The case was made quite convincingly.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day, IBEC, which was the key player in this regard as the CIF did not have the same role, was not prepared to offer because it could not deliver its own members, which is not an unreasonable position in which to find oneself in negotiations.  Therefore, congress was unable to push the issue.</P>
    <P>That proposal to place trade union recognition on a statutory basis was made towards the end of 1994 when the PCW was being negotiated, although I would have to check the precise date. Therefore, according to my recollection of the history of events, the proposal for the legal recognition of the right of a union to represent workers being underpinned by a statutory provision originates from that time.</P>
    <P>The proposal did not emerge in the agreed negotiations on the PCW.  However, it did not disappear because when negotiations for Partnership 2000 commenced at the end of the PCW the same proposal surfaced again as it had become a real issue.  We are aware of the ongoing constitutional case in that regard.</P>
    <P>I wish to place this historical recollection on the record to refute any suggestion that this is an opportunistic Bill, with the Labour Party in Opposition motivated by the difficulties being experienced in Dublin Airport.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <Col N="1113" /> I had difficulties with some aspects of the PCW negotiations.  However, this issue arose during the course of those negotiations.  This time IBEC could not kick it off the table &mdash; it had to be kicked into touch, so to speak.  It was kicked into the arms of the high level working group.  Deputy Broughan can correct me in his summing up if I do not recall matters accurately.  The high level working group, which is still extant, reached the point where it could agree a process, starting with the origination of the difficulty and ending with the Labour Court, going through the exact flow chart indicated by Deputy Broughan in the documentation he has put on the record for public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I do not know what position is taken by Government representatives on this, nor should I necessarily.  However, the sole difference between the congress representatives and IBEC representatives is whether the Labour Court should make a definitive recommendation or an employment regulation order.  These are not fundamentally new powers, although I concede they may be the adaptation of existing powers for new purposes. That is all we are proposing.</P>
    <P>I left the Department of Enterprise and Employment in 1994.  If I had, as Minister, been presented at that time with the current impasse between the congress representatives and IBEC, I would have supported such a measure.  I wish to refute, not in any acrimonious sense, the suggestion made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, that I am advocating something in Opposition which I would not have advocated when I was in Government.  That is not the case.</P>
    <P>The voluntary process was still travelling on at that time and I wished it well.  I would still prefer IBEC and congress to arrive at a voluntary agreement on the proposals set out in our Bill.  A voluntary agreement in any set of circumstances or human relationships is manifestly preferable to something which smacks of imposition or requires the underpinning of statutory law to give it effect. If I had been presented with such a Bill when I was in Government, I am sure it would have received the treatment it deserves.  However, unfortunately, the then Opposition did not propose such a Bill.</P>
    <P>Without the work on the ground of trade unions, many more disputes would go to the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission and rights commissioners than is currently the case. Collective agreements as a mechanism to prevent industrial unrest have been of crucial importance to the economy.  We have always upheld the importance of collective agreements as a vital element of our industrial relations machinery. However, their importance is being increasingly eroded through trade union derecognition in some industries and a failure of other industries to recognise trade unions at all.  Before we reach a stage where this vital element of industrial machinery is diminished completely, we must face up to the issue of trade union recognition.</P>
    <P>I wish to address a number of remaining issues. <Col N="1114" /> The first is that the Taoiseach cannot have it both ways.  He travelled to the vaulted building of City Hall in Cork and addressed the merchant princes of the city in their full finery at the chamber of commerce dinner.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, attended this event on many occasions in the past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a great welcome; it was a better welcome than Deputy Reynolds received.  It is a great occasion on which the second city of the Republic celebrates the success of commerce. Many great employers attend, several of whom created many jobs and weathered numerable storms.  They recognise and deal with trade unions, but that does not mean they do not also have problems.</P>
      <P>At that gathering I understand the Taoiseach denounced tooth and claw capitalism and he referred directly to the fact that Ryanair represents this untamed beast.  Does the Taoiseach wish to talk to one of the people sitting on the back of this beast?  I refer to a former Member of the House who was a key strategist in the recent partial electoral success of the Fianna Fáil Party. It was partial because it did not obtain an overall majority or even a working majority with the Progressive Democrats.  The Taoiseach attempted to suggest that he is against tooth and claw capitalism, but, at the same time, the former Member of the House, Fianna Fáil Minister and European Commissioner, Mr. Ray MacSharry, who is a director of Ryanair, defended the right of the company to behave as it did.  This is a contradiction and I wish to pose a question to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and other Fianna Fáil Members.  Is Mr. MacSharry still a key strategist of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Does his advice on strategy include advice on industrial relations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to a commentator in the public domain, but I accept the Chair's admonition.</P>
      <P>An overly cautious and conservative view has been expressed that foreign direct investment, which is critical to the success of the economy, will run away in droves if this type of legislation is enacted.  This is the other leg to the argument advanced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. She made a number of points which I wish to address.  I disagree fundamentally with the Tánaiste in political terms, but I believe she is sincere about this matter.  She mentioned the difficulty of persuading investors to locate in Ireland if this type of legislation was on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with these concerns and I could understand the fears if it were a case of mandatory recognition in all plants.  However, that is not proposed in the Bill.  When I had the honour of holding the office now occupied by the Tánaiste and I was asked about this matter by inward investors, I told them they did not have to have a trade union.  That is the case now and it would be position in the future if the Bill is enacted.  I told the investors it was a matter of choice but I advised them that they would have a better system of human resource management if they had a union.  However, the people who decide whether there will be a union are the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers in Seagate chose not to be represented by a union and that was their right.  Digital, because of the value system of the founder of that successful company, was prepared to pay above union rates in whatever area he operated so that he would not have to deal with unions. In addition, when it was a major manufacturing company in Galway city, Digital had an extensive and generous social programme.  It could afford it, but it was excessively generous despite the profits it generated.  However, when the crisis arose in Digital and there was a serious message to be relayed about the restructuring of the company and the closure of the entire manufacturing unit, there was no mechanism through which management could talk to the workers.  I can relate to this problem because I was caught in the eye of the storm at that time.  The type of system which Digital operated was incapable of dealing with the crisis which arose.  Digital was leaving Galway, but the absence of a union made the job to <Col N="1116" /> be confronted by the task force even more difficult in terms of dealing with people.</P>
    <P>The sequel to that story is happy, but foreign direct investment companies cannot overlook the performance of the economy, the emerging labour market shortage in terms of skills, the history of industrial relations and the extraordinary stability which enables companies in Ireland to forward plan wage rates and labour costs more than any other country in the OECD group.  I invite the Minister's advisers to consider the point that there is no other country in the European Union that can project labour costs and rates with the same degree of certainty as Ireland.  No other country can provide the same level of industrial relations peace and security.  They are not only promises.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a track record which is convincing in terms of telling an investor who is considering locating in Europe, which is effectively a choice between investing in Ireland or Wales, Scotland or the Netherlands, to look at the comparative records in terms of industrial relations stability, labour market costs and flexibility and trade union co-operation where they exist in companies. They should contrast that with the position in American companies in the main which must already deal with federal regulations on mandatory union recognition.  It is proposed that a Labour Court with 51 years of jurisprudence, of making sensible, sane and balanced decisions, shall decide whether a significant number of workers in a section of a company have the right to be professionally represented by skilled negotiators in terms of advising them on the best price they can get for the only commodity they have to sell, their ability to work.  Because of the responsibility the trade union movement has demonstrated over the past ten to 15 years, the kind of scare implicit in that assertion would simply disappear like snow off a ditch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is irritating to again have to raise in the House the hassle caused to a large number of my constituents by the so-called crime of joyriding which should more appropriately be called &ldquo;deathriding&rdquo;.  Every night in five or six parishes in my constituency mayhem is caused by joyriders.  Very often three or four stolen cars are driven in an erratic way by joyriders who endanger the lives of pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.  A few months ago when I was driving along Tonglegee Road one of these drivers narrowly missed my car.  He was being pursued by gardaí who were trying to apprehend him.  Prior to the general election there was a horrendous accident in which a senior citizen was killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has trumpeted its policy of <Col N="1117" /> zero tolerance while journalists such as Tom Brady have referred to a decrease in the level of crime.  However, this decrease is mainly due to the decision by the victims of joyriding and other crime not to report incidents because they are fed up.  If the hundreds of citizens in the north of my constituency who have been adversely affected by joyriding in recent months reported these incidents to the Garda the crime figures would be very different.  We either have zero tolerance or we do not.  I have raised the matter with the Taoiseach, parts of whose constituency have also been affected by this problem.</P>
    <P>The Garda do not have adequate resources or manpower to deal with this issue.  My constituency, which has a population of approximately 80,000, is policed by 200 gardaí, less than one third the number of gardaí deployed in Limerick. New equipment and vehicles have enabled gardaí to carry out some outstanding work in recent times.  However, complaints have been made about the delay in responding to joyriding incidents. In some cases it can take up to 30 or 40 minutes before an attempt is made to apprehend the drivers of these cars.  Sometimes resources are utilised in dealing with issues which are not of major concern to the public.  I am referring to the use of new jeeps at checkpoints set up to check car insurance and tax, while two and three joyriders are on the rampage in a nearby estate.</P>
    <P>Various measures such as ramps were introduced in the past by Dublin Corporation but it has been very slow to take measures to deal with the renewed outbreak of this crime.  Prior to 1994 we were told that when the Road Traffic Act was implemented this problem would be brought to an end.  While it reduced the problem at the time, the key point is that the Garda had the power to seize stolen cars driven by an under-aged person who did not have a licence.  This provision is not being adequately implemented at present.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the stinger and various other measures, while the Minister has speculated about the possibility of new legislation. If new legislation is necessary my party will support it.  However, serious action must be taken to deal with this problem particularly in the areas I represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express the concern of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and my concern about the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offence commonly referred to as &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; is a criminal offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1995.  The young people who engage in this activity generally cannot control the vehicles and endanger not only the lives of others but their own lives.  I assure the Deputy that no effort is spared by the Garda in trying to deter young people from engaging in this extremely dangerous form of anti-social activity.  The Garda has taken a number of initiatives to combat joyriding.  It is equipped with the <Col N="1118" /> vehicle stopping device known as &ldquo;stinger&rdquo; which can successfully slow down and stop a target vehicle.  There are sufficient members of the Garda, including members attached to north Dublin stations, trained and competent to use this device.  It is available in patrol vehicles in the northern division in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and has proved to be very effective.  Its usage is confined to incidents and circumstances where it can be deployed without risk to the Garda, the occupants of the vehicle and the general public.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has also been assured by the Garda authorities that there are regular Garda patrols and checkpoints which are designed to detect and deter breaches of the Road Traffic Acts.  The Garda authorities keep the situation with regard to the unauthorised taking of vehicles under review and are ready to introduce any measure which will combat this activity, including the purchase of any necessary equipment and reviewing policing on the ground.</P>
    <P>The causes underlying this anti-social activity are complex and varied and there are no rapid or easy solutions to them.  They are part of the problems of urban crime and disorder.  The solutions can only be found by addressing a wide range of socio-economic issues, including urban deprivation, unemployment and the planning and layout of urban areas.  Disadvantage does not excuse criminal activity but it does point to the need for a broad based response to the problem. I am not trying to downplay the importance of the direct law and order response to joyriding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has continued to support community based youth diversion schemes which are designed to divert young people away from crime, including joyriding.  These programmes, which are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are aimed predominantly at young people and involve various activities, sporting and otherwise, including counselling, informal group work, anti-vandalism programmes and other activities deemed appropriate in each of the catchment areas.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area referred to by the Deputy, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform continues to provide funding for youth diversion programmes which target the large young and active population of the area. These projects involve local communities in partnership with the Garda, the probation and welfare service and other appropriate agencies.  The aims of these programmes are to prevent crime, to divert young people away from crime, to improve the quality of life of young people, to provide activities aimed at improving life, communicating skills and personal development and to support and improve Garda/community relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been assured by the Garda authorities that they are taking all possible steps to deter young people from getting involved in joyriding <Col N="1119" /> in north Dublin and elsewhere.  They will continue to work closely with local communities, local authorities and State services to achieve this goal.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Remedial Teachers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I believe the Minister will appoint remedial teachers in the next few weeks.  Ninety per cent of national schoolchildren have access to a remedial teacher while 76 per cent have the services of one. Yet 32 schools in County Mayo have no access to a remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>St. Colmcille national school, the Quay, Westport, No. 13145a, has been looking for a remedial teacher for many years.  Westport is one of the fastest growing towns in the west, if not in the whole country.  A large number of children attend that school, some of whom come from disadvantaged areas.  That school has been looking for a remedial teacher for the past three years.</P>
      <P>We all know that if children who have difficulty with learning, reading or writing are not looked after at national school, they are disadvantaged in secondary school from the outset.  They never seem to be able to pick up what they have lost at national school.  Sometimes one would wonder who is being well looked after by the Celtic tiger. Certainly it is not the people who are disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to appoint a number of remedial teachers to the 32 schools in the county which have no remedial teachers and no access to remedial teachers.  If the Minister could appoint one remedial teacher for Muirisc national school, No. 16832l, St. Colmcille national school and maybe Drummin national school, No. 17039v, at least it would be a start.  I would prefer to see three teachers appointed for those schools, but I hope something will be done for them this year.</P>
      <P>Keenaghbeg national school, No. 14923e, is another school in a disadvantaged area which has been ravaged by emigration and which finds it difficult to attract pupils.  If schools do not have remedial services, parents will not send their children there.  That causes a problem for rural schools because if people have a car and a little money, they will send their children to another school rather than send them to the nearest school.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to make sure County Mayo gets its fair share of remedial teachers, something which did not happen in the past.  The fact that the 32 schools in County Mayo do not have a remedial service is a disgrace and I am sorry the Minister is not present to hear me say so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government appointed 53 remedial teachers in the last school year, yet there are 32 of these schools in County Mayo.  The Minister should look after the people who are disadvantaged. No county is more disadvantaged than County Mayo.  I mentioned some of the schools <Col N="1120" /> but there are many more.  I could continue speaking for ten minutes about the schools which need a remedial service.  In addition to those I mentioned already, Killala national school and Rathbane national school are among those in need of a remedial service.  I hope that when the Minister appoints remedial teachers in the next three weeks he will not forget County Mayo, but if he does I will be back here raising the matter on the Adjournment and I will not be as quiet as I am tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this issue, the need for a remedial teacher in Croagh, Kilfinny, Kilcolman, Coolcappa and Cappagh national schools, County Limerick.  In reply to a question which I tabled to the Minister on 16 December, the Minister stated that there are 38 schools in County Limerick which do not have a remedial teacher, 21 of which are in my constituency, Limerick West.  It is totally unacceptable that 22 years after remedial teaching was first introduced there are children without access to a remedial service.  Parents and teachers are rightly demanding that the neglect of the children requiring the service must not continue beyond this school year and I urge the Minister not to let this neglect continue.</P>
      <P>The appointment of a teacher would be of huge benefit to the children involved.  It will not only benefit those children who are in need of a remedial teacher but also pupils with high potential. Teachers can deal adequately with the middle group, but it is the very bright and those who are a little slower in some subjects who suffer most.  The standard of education, which is high in the schools I mentioned in Croagh, Kilfinny, Kilcolman, Coolcappa and Cappagh, would be further enhanced for all pupils if a remedial teacher were appointed to service the schools.</P>
      <P>They have been looking for a remedial service over a number of years and they are now demanding that the Minister address the situation and appoint a remedial teacher.  Children from the schools, whose parents realise they have a difficulty, are almost forced to go to schools where a remedial teacher is available.  Therefore, pupils are being transferred out of the catchment area of those schools.  It is a rural area and the schools need all their pupils to retain the current number of teachers.  It is depressing to see pupils who are in need of a remedial teacher being moved out. It is most unjust and it is discriminating against the children who are most vulnerable.</P>
      <P>An assumption is made that students requiring the services of a remedial teacher are underachievers or not as gifted academically as others.  This is not necessarily so.  Many who come through professional remedial teaching have been successful academically.  One must never make an assumption that those who are in need of remedial teaching are not capable of the highest level of achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should treat all children equally.  Children in small rural schools should have the same facilities <Col N="1121" /> and opportunities as those in large urban areas.  However, the children requiring remedial help to which I am referring in Croagh, Kilfinny, Kilcolman, Coolcappa and Cappagh national schools are being deprived of it.  This is unfair and discriminatory.  The situation should be corrected and a remedial teacher should be appointed within the next three weeks when the Minister is making his appointments.  It is important that a child in need of remedial teaching receives it at primary level.</P>
    <P>The problem of education of the disadvantaged must be addressed at primary level and it is important that the identification of problems is made at an early stage in a child's school life. Children who are unable to cope with school must be professionally assisted.  The inability of schools to deal with such children must be addressed.  Children with problems in the schools to which I have referred do not have a remedial teacher and are being discriminated against by the Department.</P>
    <P>Underachievement in school is not unique.  It exists in all communities.  With the exceptional pressures placed on children to perform, it is essential that remedial teaching is available to all who require it.  Learning difficulty is viewed as the gap between attainment of pupils and their potential.  Remedial teaching aims to close the gap by providing additional specialised teaching on an individual or group basis.  In the schools under discussion, there are children in need of the assistance and until it is available the education system is failing them.</P>
    <P>The absence of the remedial teacher is clearly identified in the transition of pupils from primary to secondary school.  Such pupils experience extreme difficulties.  Many do not complete their secondary education.  Children in need of remedial teaching who do not receive it are more likely to find themselves among the long-term unemployed because of the failure in the education system to provide a remedial service which would enable them to reach their potential.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister on behalf of the parents, teachers and the children of these schools to examine this issue and appoint a remedial teacher forthwith.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising these matters as it affords me an opportunity to inform the House on the provision which is being made to <Col N="1122" /> address the needs in this area.  We are currently not in a position to make remedial teacher posts available to the primary school sector.</P>
    <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
    <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September last.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a remedial teaching service.</P>
    <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers. The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.  However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.</P>
    <P>Of the 187 ordinary national schools in County Mayo, 112 now have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes ten schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent redistribution of posts.  This means that approximately 73 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Mayo currently have access to a remedial service.</P>
    <P>Of the 146 ordinary national schools in County Limerick, 119 now have the services of a remedial teacher either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes seven schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that approximately 89 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Limerick currently have access to a remedial service.</P>
    <P>We are reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of all schools, including those in County Mayo and Croagh, Kilfinny, Kilcolman, Coolcappa and Cappagh national schools in County Limerick will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken later this year by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 February 1998.</P>

      <P>There are two competitions currently under way on the development of alternative energy sources.  The Aer III competition aims to secure an additional 100 megawatts of electricity generating capacity from renewable energy sources, wind, hydro, waste, biomass and wave.  The closing date for receipt of commercial bids for the competition was 13 February 1998.</P>
      <P>An independent agency, ETSU, appointed to conduct the competition on behalf of my Department, is currently assessing the commercial bids received and I expect to be in a position to announce the results early in the coming month. The Aer IV competition, which I launched on 22 September 1997, aims to secure an additional 25 megawatts of newly installed electricity generating capacity from high efficiency combined heat and power systems.  Furthermore, it will seek to contract up to ten megawatts of electricity generating capacity from existing similar systems.</P>
      <P>The Aer IV competition closed for technical bids on Friday, 23 January 1998.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the guaranteed electricity market access for Irish renewable energy projects successful in securing Thermie grants has been continued for the 1998 round.  It has also been broadened to include combined heat and power projects.  For successful biomass projects, a special enhanced tariff structure has been negotiated.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 30 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer to Question No. 50 of 16 December 1997.</P>
      <P>The Government remains concerned about BNFL's plans to increase the production of MOX fuel at its plant in Sellafield.  Indeed, these concerns have been conveyed directly to the UK authorities on a number of occasions.</P>
      <P>Early last year the UK's environment agency launched a public consultation process to decide whether the MOX plant was justified, that is, the perceived benefits and detrimental effects of the project would have to be assessed by the agency. As part of that consultation, my Department forwarded a submission to the agency detailing the Government's concerns about BNFL's proposal. More recently, I raised this issue when I met the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, last November.  A second consultation process has now been launched by the environment agency to consider an independent assessment report on the MOX plant.  This report was commissioned by the environment agency following its initial public consultation held early last year.  At that time BNFL was criticised for failing to provide an economic case for the MOX plant in its application.  My Department, as an interested party, will be forwarding a further submission to the environment agency in the coming weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Forfás year-end review issued on 15 January 1998.</P>
      <P>The powers of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation are being extended to include the promotion of competition and to protect the interests of all customers, including business customers, through the transposition into Irish law of relevant EU directives.</P>
      <P>In particular, over the last number of months, this has been done though the transposition of Directive 95/62 on the application of the open network provision to voice telephony and Directive 97/33 in relation to interconnection.  The transposition on 31 October 1997 of EU Directive 95/62 on the application of the open network provision in relation to voice telephony has provided for a framework of consumer rights for telephone users, including business users, when dealing with Telecom Éireann.  The regulations extend both the obligations on Telecom Éireann as monopoly provider of voice telephony services and the powers of the director in regard to a range of matters relating to the services offered by the company.</P>
      <P>Among the obligations imposed on Telecom Éireann are those covering the publication of details of the services offered, minimum standards of service to be delivered and those to ensure that voice telephony tariffs are cost-oriented and transparently set.  The director's powers include those in relation to the monitoring of Telecom Éireann's compliance with its obligations and supervising any special tariff schemes introduced by the company.</P>
      <P>The regulations transposing EU Directive 97/33 on interconnection which I signed into force on 22 January 1998 have enhanced the director's powers further to include specific powers to oversee the terms of interconnection agreements between operators and to resolve any disputes that arise in this regard.  These regulations are significant in that they give rights of interconnection with the Telecom Éireann network to the many emerging and new operators in the Irish telecommunications sector.  The regulations establish strict rules of pricing and should have a significant downward effect on the costs involved in this area which can account for about 40 per cent of the total costs of new operators.</P>
      <P>These developments are part of an ongoing process of enhancing the powers of the director and of ensuring that effective competition exists in the marketplace.  Further measures will be put in place before the introduction of full competition into the Irish telecommunciations market on 1 January 2000, including, in particular, in the course of transposition of Directive 97/13 which deals with the licensing of telecommunications operators and requires national regulatory authorities to be duly empowered to ensure compliance with licence conditions of operators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33, 34, 45, 47, 50, 65, 66, 71 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>I first outlined my position in regard to the campaign for retention of duty free to the House on 30 September last and have done so on many subsequent occasions.</P>
      <P>As recently as Monday, 9 February, I addressed the Airports Council International conference in Dublin on the subject of duty free. The conference brought together several hundred delegates from airports all over Europe and further afield.  I availed of the opportunity to impress on the delegates the need for their own Governments to contribute to a concerted effort, by all the member states, if we are to get a positive result in Europe on duty free.</P>
      <P>The subject of duty free was also raised under Private Members' business a fortnight ago.  We extensively debated the issue over two days, Tuesday and Wednesday, 10 and 11 February.  In that debate, I set out fully my plans on the campaign to retain duty free.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, stated clearly what the procedural requirements were in order to reverse the decision of the European Council to abolish the duty free concession, or to obtain a deferral of the date set for that abolition, that is, July 1999.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, 12 February, this House held a full debate on aviation policy.  Again, I took the opportunity to advise the House, in the course of that debate, of my plans in relation to the duty free campaign which is of such particular importance for the aviation sector.</P>
      <P>I announced during those debates that I intended to raise the issue of retaining duty free in person with both the British and German transport ministers.  Yesterday, I met the British Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, at a transport conference in London.  I have also arranged a meeting with my German counterpart, Matthias Wissmann, on 3 March and arrangements are in hand to meet Jean Claude Gayssot, my French counterpart.</P>
      <P>The House will understand that both Germany and Britain play key roles in the EU.  The British currently hold the Presidency of Europe and Germany's size and significance in economic and political terms assures it a pivotal position on the European stage.  I will be taking the opportunity presented by these meetings with my European colleagues to underline the need for the EU Commission to carry out its own study into the effects of abolition of duty free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> As the Deputy knows, reversal of the present decision requires a proposal from the Commission and unanimous agreement of the ECOFIN council.  Pending the completion of a Commission sponsored study of the effects of the abolition of duty free and the examination of its findings by the member states, the Commission must now be persuaded to make a proposal for the deferral of the abolition of duty free sales for travel within the EU.</P>
    <P>I have raised this matter at both Councils of Transport Ministers which were held under the Luxembourg Presidency in October and December last.  I will continue to raise it at every appropriate opportunity.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my response to earlier parliamentary questions, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is currently awaiting the report of a study, commissioned by his Department, to establish the impact of the loss of duty free sales on Irish employment, transport and Government revenues.  This independent study will be completed shortly and will provide a clearer picture of the likely effects on employment and other important areas such as transport and tourism.</P>
    <P>I believe it is quite clear that I and my colleagues in Government are availing of every possible opportunity to further the campaign for the deferral of the decision to abolish duty free sales in 1999.  It is not possible at present to give a definite response as to whether or not our campaign for the deferral of the duty free decision will be successful.  However, I am optimistic that if pressure can be brought to bear on the European Commission to conduct an EU-wide study, the results will speak for themselves and the Commission will be persuaded to make a proposal. Indeed, I believe that my contacts with my British, German and French counterparts in the next few weeks will prove fruitful and should help to increase the pressure on the Commission considerably.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 38, 46, 52, 57, 61, 75, 77, 78 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>As far as forms of assistance to Ryanair are concerned, other than reduced or rebated airport charges, from inquiries which my Department has made of the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I understand that Ryanair up to the end of 1994 had received tourism marketing grants totalling £1.062 million under the Operational Programmes for Tourism, 1989-93 and 1994-99.  These were European Regional Development Fund funds from programmes which were generally available for tourism promotion purposes and as such did not constitute State aid.</P>
      <P>I also understand that FÁS provided £45,600 to Ryanair in the years 1991-93 under the FÁS training support scheme and a further £120,900 in the years 1993 and 1994 under the FÁS job training scheme.  Such moneys were generally available from FÁS to industry for training support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> Finally, I understand it was announced in late 1996 that Ryanair, in the form of its subsidiary Ryanair Direct, will receive assistance of £2.2 million over the years 1997-99 from Forbairt for the establishment of a new teleservice-telemarketing business in Dublin.  This type of support to industry is widely available and I understand that it generally comes under an exemption, agreed with the European Commission, from the State aids rules.  In line with this exemption, the assistance to Ryanair Direct was not required to be reported to the Commission.</P>
    <P>As regards the allocation of routes to Ryanair and Aer Lingus in 1989, the position is as follows. The then Minister for Tourism and Transport announced in September 1989 a Government policy for Irish aviation.  The Minister granted exclusive rights to Ryanair in 1989 on routes from Dublin to Luton, Stansted, Liverpool and Munich. It should be noted that at the same time, it was decided to grant Aer Lingus sole rights on the routes from Ireland to Heathrow and Gatwick and from Dublin to Manchester and to Paris.  The decision applied for a period of three years up to the end of 1992.</P>

      <P>Some 4,979 farmers benefited under the farm electrification scheme between 1990 and the end of 1997.  The Exchequer contribution under the scheme during that period was £3,748,839.  Under standard terms ESB normally bears 50 per cent of the cost of new connections but the board make an additional 10 per cent contribution under this scheme, which amounted to approximately £1,874,420 in the period in question.</P>
      <P>The principle of uniform charging for services set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium is a long established practice in the case of ESB tariffs and electricity customers are not discriminated against in the unit price they are charged because of their location.</P>
      <P>In regard to connection charges, however, rural customers can suffer significant variations in charges depending on their location and distance from the network.  ESB are currently reviewing their connection charges policy with a view to introducing a standard connection charge for a guaranteed level and quality of supply for the vast majority of rural customers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 128 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that there are 1,634 railway crossings accessing private lands and property, while the number of manual level crossings on private and public roads is 580.  In addition, there are 19 level crossings which are fully automated.  I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that an examination of records available from January 1988 to December 1997 indicates that only 20 per cent of accidents at level crossings involved trains.  The remaining 80 per cent were road traffic accidents involving road vehicles colliding with level crossings. The accident data includes minor incidents as well as serious accidents and it is important that accident statistics should be considered in this context.  The specific information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>

    <P>On 9 December last I announced my intention to appoint independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of rail safety, covering all relevant aspects including infrastructure, policy and practice.  The terms of reference for the review specifically require the consultants to consider level crossings.  Proposals from prospective consultants were received on 3 February 1998.  A number of candidates who submitted proposals for the consultancy were interviewed by officials from my Department on 18 February and I expect to appoint the successful applicants very shortly once the contractual arrangements have been agreed and the necessary approvals have been obtained.  The study will take six months to complete.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> As I indicated in this House on 9 December last, I intend to publish the report when it is finalised.</P>

      <P>The detailed compliance with the price cap is, of course, a day to day matter for Telecom Éireann, but it is subject to verification by the Director of Telecommunications Regulaton.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in an intensive series of negotiations with the union coalition in Telecom Éireann on an employee share ownership plan for employees.  While good progress is being made in the discussions, the negotiations have not yet reached a stage where final agreement has been reached.  I remain confident that agreement will be reached soon.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is prepared to make available up to 5 per cent of the company's equity to the employees in return for the verified implementation of restructuring, specified cost reduction and change within the company.  The Government is also open to practical and feasible proposals by the employees to bring their shareholding in the company up to 14.9 per cent in return for cash payment to the Exchequer on transfer at a fair price when it is satisfied that this will assist the future development of the company and that the conditions relating to the initial shareholding of up to 5 per cent are satisfactory.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that shares wil be made available to employees through employee share ownership programme involving trust schemes and structures which offer employees favourable tax treatment for the purchase of shares in their company and which ensure that shares are allocated to employees in a tax efficient way.</P>
      <P>The fair price to be paid by the employees for the shareholding of up to 9.9 per cent will have regard to a current market valuation of the company, an exercise which is currently being undertaken by Morgan Stanley, the financial advisers engaged on the project by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> My colleague, the Minister for Finance, and I in conjunction with our financial advisers, are working with the union coalition in identifying an efficient financing structure to fund the acquisition of shares by the employees.</P>
    <P>Aside from valuation and price issues, there are a number of other matters of a complex nature which are being addressed in the negotiations, including the legal architecture of trust arrangements for holding the employees' shareholding and how to deal with new employees joining the company and employees who retire.  A mechanism is needed also to verify that company transformation is being implemented.  It is not intended that the scheme will apply to persons who have already retired from the company as employee share ownership programmes are designed to incentivise existing employees.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated previously to the House, the sale of any shareholding beyond 5 per cent to the employees will require the consent of KPN/Telia, the strategic partners in Telecom Éireann and they are being kept fully up to date with developments in the discussions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, as I have indicated to the House in replying to previous questions on this subject, any decision on the future of Cablelink must be taken in consultation with Telecom Éireann's strategic partners, KPN/Telia.

      <P>In the context of the Government's overall policy on the information society, it is vital that the correct decision is made in terms of Cablelink's future development, particularly given the enhanced capability of cable networks to deliver interactive multimedia services, voice telephony and digital TV.

In this regard I would like to commend Aer Rianta Cork management and staff for their excellent contribution towards this growth.</P>
    <P>Because of this dramatic growth Aer Rianta has accelerated their forward development programme at Cork Airport.  The expansion programme now under way at Cork Airport up to 2001 will involve capital expenditure of £18 million on upgrading runway and passenger terminal facilities.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some concerns have been expressed about the adequacy of flights to and from Cork airport to service the needs of the tourism and business sectors in the Cork region. I am also very conscious of the infrastructural needs of the regions in terms of promoting balanced economic development of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I note that a consultant has been engaged by IDA-Forfás to analyse possible solutions to the perceived air travel needs of the business community in the Cork and Shannon regions and to identify ways of improving the adequacy of air services, for example, through schedule changes or provision of increased or new services.  It is intended that the consultant will, in association with Aer Rianta, make presentations to air carriers including, of course, Aer Lingus on the scope for improved commercial air services.  I look forward to the outcome of this study.</P>

      <P>The question of developing Baldonnel <Col N="1140" /> as a second commercial airport for Dublin was thoroughly investigated under the previous Government.  On 24 January 1996, the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications announced that, having consulted with his Cabinet colleagues, he had reached the conclusion that the project would not be in the interests of the aviation sector and the economy generally.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> As to contingency plans to deal with an emergency, my Department has the capacity to respond to potential oil supply disruptions whether such supply difficulties arose from external events such as conflict in the Middle East or circumstances originating locally such as a bottleneck at one of our main oil terminals.  In so far as external emergencies are concerned, the emergency response capacity of my Department would complement those which have been established under the auspices of the International Energy Agency, IEA.  In essence, any shortage of supply in world oil markets would require an international response under mechanisms agreed within the IEA.  Our national contingency arrangements would enable us to respond as necessary to the particular disruption concerned and would include measures to restrain demand or to draw down stocks if necessary.</P>
    <P>Any emergency response, whatever the cause, will rely upon close co-operation and consultation between my Department, INPC, the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA and the oil importers to deal with the range of problems that can arise. Recent experience of the aftermath of the <i>Sea Empress</i> incident at Milford Haven and the blockade of Dublin port last year confirm that these arrangements work effectively.  However, my Department is currently reviewing its contingency arrangements to ensure that we continue to be in a healthy state of readiness in the event of an oil supply disruption.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the needs of the Dublin suburban rail network and in particular the Maynooth line.  Indeed, I have already advised the Deputy in my reply to his question of 28 January 1998 that the specific requirements of the Maynooth suburban rail service are being evaluated as part of the review of Dublin's suburban rail development needs which is being undertaken by CIE at present.</P>
      <P>Earlier proposals from CIE had concentrated on the doubling of the line.  However, it became clear during an independent evaluation of these proposals that doubling the railway line from Clonsilla to Maynooth would not in itself bring about any material improvement in suburban rail services on that line.  A wider range of development constraints including signalling, rolling stock and the capacity of the city centre rail network to cater for additional services are, therefore, being examined with a view to identifying clear investment priorities.</P>
      <P>This study, which CIE will finalise shortly, will provide the basis for discussions with the European Commission on investment priorities and funding aspects.</P>

      <P>Partnership 2000 provided for the setting up of the National Centre for Partnership whose mission is to foster, directly and indirectly, partnership arrangements, involving the acceptance of employees as stakeholders, which will secure the competitiveness, viability and prosperity of enterprises and the modernisation of the public service.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 has, as a key objective, the promotion of enterprise in both the private and public sectors.  This is crucial for the achievement of sustainable growth.  If partnership is to be successful it must work at the level of each workplace, where the players can work in harmony towards commonly agreed objectives.  This inclusiveness will help to secure competitiveness, viability and prosperity in enterprise.  It will also facilitate the modernisation of the public service so that it can continue to contribute to national growth and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Successful partnership in both the private and public sectors will give this country a sound platform on which to build for the new millennium as a competitive, dynamic and results-driven economy.  The work of the National Centre for Partnership is designed to support this approach and I am confident that the centre is progressing well towards the achievement of its overall aims of facilitating trust and partnership between employers, employees and unions in both the private and public sectors at the level of the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following immediate work programme was agreed at the first meeting of the board on 24 September 1997: the dissemination of &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; through the identification and study of those organisations where successful partnership is in operation and where the lessons learned can be promulgated in both the private and public sectors; the monitoring of developments on partnership, <Col N="1147" /> including the putting in place of a national benchmarking survey; and supporting partnership through training and development, in conjunction with IBEC, ICTU and other relevant organisations.</P>
    <P>Two joint directors have been appointed and advertisements have now been placed for staff at executive level.  The staff of the centre are implementing the work programme and the budget for the centre for 1998 is £500,000.</P>
    <P>As regards regional centres, it is not envisaged at this point that separate centres will be established.</P>

      <P>Neither my Department nor the Irish Insurance <Col N="1148" /> Federation has received representations or complaints regarding the non availability of permanent and total disablement insurance cover for retained firemen.  I understand that occupational cover for both full-time and retained firemen is underwritten on behalf of local authorities by Irish Public Bodies Insurance Limited.  Life and occupational insurance cover is available on an optional basis to all full-time firemen through the offices of Allied Insurance Consultants and most full-time firemen are covered under the scheme. The same broker offered a life assurance package to retained firemen, but, despite extensive advertising, the response was very poor and it was not feasible to implement the scheme.</P>

      <P>The EU negotiating position in advance of the Kyoto conference proposed that developing country parties, individually or jointly, reduce emission levels for carbon dioxide &mdash; CO 2, methane &mdash; CH 4 and nitrous oxide &mdash; N 2O together by at least 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2005 and 2010 respectively.  The EU proposal was not a unilateral commitment and was subject to acceptance of comparable commitments by other developed countries.  As part of the preparation of the EU negotiating position, the Government <Col N="1149" /> adopted an indicative national target of limiting the increase in the emissions of these gases together to 15 per cent above the 1990 level by the year 2010.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, adopted on 11 December 1997, sets, <i>inter alia,</i> a legally binding target for the member states of the EU to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouses gases &mdash; CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, hydrofluorocarbons &mdash; HFCs, perfluorocarbons &mdash; PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride &mdash; SF 6, &mdash; by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.  It is intended that the EU will meet the target using provisions in the protocol concerning joint fulfilment and on the basis of agreed internal burden sharing.</P>
      <P>The internal burden sharing arrangement to which the indicative national target relates is now subject to review in the light of the Kyoto outcome, with particular regard to the inclusion of three additional gases &mdash; HFCs, PFCs and SF 6, the different timeframe involved and the provisions regarding the use of sinks to absorb CO 2. It is expected that the review will be finalised by June this year.</P>
      <P>A consultancy study commissioned by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Public Enterprise to identify and evalute the scope for intensifying existing, and developing additional, policies and measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be completed shortly.  It will be necessary for future policy development in all relevant sectors, including the industrial sector, to have regard to climate change considerations, including the obligations in the Kyoto Protocol and developments at EU level. The conclusions of the consultancy study to which I have referred will assist in this regard.</P>
      <P>Until agreement is reached on burden sharing arrangements, it will not be possible to determine the implications for all economic sectors, including industry.  However, I assure the Deputy that I will keep in regular contact with my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and other interested parties regarding this important issue.</P>

      <P>In December 1997, Seagate Technology Ireland Limited announced its intention to close the company's Clonmel operation in early 1998.  A task force was immediately established in response to this announcement.  The IDA Ireland focus for the <Col N="1150" /> immediate future will clearly be to actively participate with the task force with a view to getting replacement industry as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of winning new overseas investment, I am informed that IDA Ireland is operating a three point strategy.  First is the promotion of the Seagate facility and site for one or more new high-tech industries.  A brochure has been prepared on the facility and has been circulated to all IDA Ireland overseas offices.  Second, in response to the focused promotion of Clonmel generally, there have been six site visits by potential overseas investors to Clonmel in 1998.  Two of these were to the Seagate facility and four were to another site in Clonmel.  As the Deputy will appreciate, contacts between IDA Ireland and the promoters of potential projects are conducted on a confidential basis and, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of such contacts.  Third, IDA Ireland is also focusing on a number of existing overseas companies in the Clonmel area to encourage and support them to expand their operations there.</P>
      <P>The task force has adopted a positive and constructive approach and the local management of Seagate are extending support to the employees in seeking alternative employment.  IDA Ireland will continue to work closely with the county's local authorities and chambers of commerce in addition to playing a highly active role within the task force.</P>

I further understand that a sub-committee of the Clonmel task force has considered the position of these students in relation to the continuation of their studies and I am informed that the task force is to make recommendations shortly in this regard.</P>
      <P>While the issues in this case may not be for consideration by my Department, I will ensure that immediately on receipt of the task force's report, they will be referred to the appropriate Government Departments for consideration.</P>

      <P>Investment decisions made by the high technology sectors, including the information technology and communication sectors, will always be influenced by the availability of the necessary physical infrastructure together with skill requirements, particularly language skills for telemarketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> It is one of my priority policy objectives, together with my Government colleagues, to ensure that the infrastructure and skills which are necessary to attract investment and jobs in those sectors become more widely available across the country, with a competitive cost structure which enables IDA Ireland to market locations such as the west and north west for teleservices business. I do not believe, therefore, that the comments to which the Deputy refers could in any sense be taken to have an undermining effect on the excellent efforts of Údarás na Gaeltachta in securing projects in these sectors, efforts which I strongly support.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to pursue a policy of encouraging and facilitating the most equitable regional distribution of jobs throughout the country. The result of this proactive approach was reflected in 1997 in several announcements for areas outside the larger urban centres.</P>
    <P>The figures for the west region for 1997 are encouraging in that they show an increase of 9.5 per cent on the previous years.  While the corresponding figures for the north-west region are disappointing, IDA Ireland is firm in its commitment to attracting more investment to that region.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that both the west and the north-west areas will continue to be actively promoted during 1998.</P>

      <P>The further roll out of the LES is being considered in the context of a broad review of labour market policy issues, including the need for a strengthening of the employment service role generally and for improved institutional coherence between the various agencies involved in this area.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 111 together.</P>
      <P>I set out in detail the Government's position as regards Algeria in my reply to parliamentary questions answered on 19 February 1998.</P>
      <P>In brief, the Government has stressed its close solidarity with the Algerian people in all contacts which we have had with the Algerian authorities.  I emphasised this issue in my discussions with Algerian Government leaders during my visit to that country last December. On that occasion I pressed for the admittance of UN special human rights rapporteurs to Algeria.  I also indicated that together with my EU colleagues, I was at the disposal of the protagonists should the EU be requested to help facilitate a political solution.</P>
      <P>The Government has also been active at the level of the EU in urging greater efforts by the Union towards the ending of violence in Algeria. We were particularly supportive of the offer made during the recent visit of the ministerial level EU Troika when the EU side offered to provide humanitarian assistance to the survivors of massacres in Algeria &mdash; an offer which the Algerian Government declined.</P>
      <P>I will continue to pursue a policy of active diplomacy and urge my colleagues in the Union to do so individually and collectively as I believe therein lies the best hope of success in this tragic situation.</P>

      <P>The Joint Aviation Authorities &mdash; JAA &mdash; are an associate body of the European Civil Aviation Conference &mdash; ECAC <Col N="1159" />&mdash; representing the civil aviation safety regulatory authorities of a number of European states who have agreed to co-operate in developing and implementing common safety regulatory standards and procedures.  This co-operation is intended to provide high and consistent standards of safety.  The JAA is a pan-European body with a broader base than the EU but does not have a formal legal status.</P>
      <P>The EU Council adopted in 1991 EU Regulation 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation.  The idea behind this regulation is that the rules developed within the JAA system can be presented to the EU Council for adoption.  This procedure formally legalises, within the EU, the common standards adopted within the JAA system.</P>
      <P>The rules adopted by the JAA have no legal status unless they are either adopted within the EU system or are implemented by the national aviation authorities into national law.  In this regard the Irish Aviation Authority is the responsible authority.</P>
      <P>The general experience amongst EU member states is that EU Regulation 3922/91 has not proved to be effective.  This has led to calls for a more formally and legally structured safety authority with Europe.  Discussions are ongoing within the EU Council regarding the possible establishment of such an authority.  It is too early to say what form such an authority would take and therefore its accountability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there is a natural gas interconnector pipeline in operation between Moffat in Scotland and Loughshinny in north County Dublin.  The interconnector was constructed by Bord Gáis Éireann to provide for the growing demand for natural gas and to provide security of supply in the event of a disruption in gas supplies from the Kinsale Head-Ballycotton field.  This year it is expected that some 50 per cent of our natural gas requirements will be imported through the interconnector. The reserves at Kinsale Head-Ballycotton are depleting and are likely to be exhausted in about five years time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A bilateral agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom dated 30 April 1993 facilitates the operation of the interconnector.  The agreement provides for a free flow of information <Col N="1160" /> between the two Governments about matters relating to the operation of the interconnector and the current and projected utilisation of its capacity.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the terms of the bilateral agreement, a connecting sub-sea pipeline to Northern Irealnd from the interconnector has been constructed by the Northern Ireland Authorities to provide natural gas to that area.  That pipeline runs from Tynholme in Scotland to Ballylumford, County Antrim.</P>
    <P>There is a high degree of cross-Border co-operation on natural gas issues.  There are frequent contacts between my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development in that regard.  For example, a joint North-South study of the feasibility of the provision of a natural gas interconnector between Dublin and Belfast was completed last year.  That report showed that a natural gas interconnector is technically feasible and represents the most costeffective means of the potential solutions considered in relation to gas supply issues for both sides of the Border.  The estimated cost of the interconnector is £80 million.</P>
    <P>A major study of natural gas demand to the year 2025 is currently being carried out by my Department and Bord Gáis Éireann.  The purpose of the study is to ensure that all necessary gas infrastructural improvements and additions, both within and to the State, are carried out in good time.  The report of the North-South feasibility study is being considered as part of the gas demand study.</P>
    <P>The electricity systems on both sides of the Border are interconnected via 275/220kV double circuit line between Dundalk station, County Louth and Tandragee station, County Armagh. This interconnector was out of commission for many years but has become fully operational again since March 1995 following the ceasefire in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This interconnector was supplemented in 1991 by the construction of two 110kv standby interconnectors from Letterkenny to Strabane and Swanlinbar to Enniskillen for which EU funding under the INTERREG programme was sought and received.  These two interconnectors are used by ESB and Northern Ireland Electricity &mdash; NIE &mdash; to provide emergency back-up supply to Enniskillen and Letterkenny respectively.</P>
    <P>A recent joint ESB-NIE feasibility study on cross-Border interconnection indicated that further interconnectors are dependent on reinforcement of the networks, particularly on NIE's side of the Border.  The precise timing of this reinforcement is a matter for NIE but is unlikely to occur until after the year 2000.</P>
    <P>ESB and NIE will be undertaking further studies to determine the future optimum and complementary network investments on both sides of the Border so as to maximise the benefits of interconnection.  The question of an undersea electricity link with Wales is examined on a regular basis but at the moment it is not an economic <Col N="1161" /> proposition.  The capital cost is very high and it is much cheaper to build a gas fired generating plant here in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Noise penalties are generally only applied at airports which are noise constrained due to the existence of extensive residential development in their immediate environs.  At Dublin Airport, long-term planning and the co-operation of the local planning authority and other State agencies has meant that new residential developments have generally only been confined to those areas where aircraft noise is less significant.</P>
      <P>The regulations which apply in Ireland to aircraft noise levels are contained in the European Communities (Restriction of Civil subsonic Jet Aeroplane Operations) Regulations, 1993 (S.  I. No. 130 of 1993).  These regulations give effect to the provisions of EU Council Directive No. 92/14/EEC affecting the operation of certain categories of subsonic jet aeroplanes within the territories of the member states.</P>
      <P>Council Directive No. 92/14/EEC applies to all member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of the Council directive and the regulations means that aircraft shall not be operated at an airport within the State as from 1 April 1995, unless there is in force in respect of that aircraft a noise certificate, certifying that the noise made by that aircraft is not greater than the noise levels specified in Part II, Chapter 3, volume 1 of Annex 16 (2nd Edition, 1988) to the Chicago Convention.  I should add that there are provisions in the regulations which enable me to grant exemptions or to recognise other member states' exemptions for certain stated purposes.</P>

      <P>Mullinahone Co-op commenced distribution of the current automatic supply of eartags to farmers from early in January.  As was the case of supply in 1996 and 1997, farmers in the main dairying counties in the southern part of the country received tags first.  All farmers who under the predictive system used were deemed to require supplies of tags will have received tags by now.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department made a special arrangement with Mullinahone Co-op whereby they produced an emergency supply of tags on their premises in Mullinahone.  Under this arrangement, tags were supplied to farmers who demonstrated an urgent need to move calves born on the holding to sale or on animal health/welfare grounds.  This arrangement worked well and enabled prompt supply of tags to farmers to meet their immediate needs.</P>

      <P>The blind person's pension is taxable under section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  Treating the blind person's pension as income for tax purposes is merely to treat it in the same way as <Col N="1175" /> other social welfare pensions.  Unemployment assistance is not chargeable to tax under current income tax legislation.  I would remind the Deputy that in the recent budget I announced an increase in the blind person's income tax allowance of £300 to £1,000 for a single person or married couple where one spouse is blind and an increase of £400 to £2,000 for a married couple where both spouses are blind.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 192 of 10 February 1998, form P21 (Balancing Statement) issued to the taxpayer in advance of receipt of a return of income.  I am further informed by the Commissioners that the last return of income completed in the particular case was at least ten years ago.  The inspector of taxes did not have current information for the case other than the fact that the taxpayer had an employment subject to PAYE.  In the particular circumstances, the inspector had no option but to endorse the P21 accordingly.</P>
      <P>On receipt of a return of income and supporting documentation (which would normaly include the P60) a final balancing statement, if required, will be issued immediately.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a properly completed self-assessed inheritance tax return in respect of the benefit taken by the person in question has not to date been delivered to <Col N="1176" /> them.  It is not possible therefore to comment on the tax liability, if any, arising in this case at this stage.  However, the Commissioners have informed me that while the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, does not allow for the waiver or reduction of tax due, provision does exist for flexible methods of payment and for the postponement of payment of tax in certain circumstances including hardships cases.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners have informed me that if payment of any tax due in this case would cause excessive hardship for the beneficiary, they will consider the matter sympathetically.  In this context the beneficiary or the agent acting on the beneficiary's behalf, should outline the grounds on which such hardship is being claimed together with supporting information regarding the personal and financial circumstances of the person in question when they are submitting the tax return.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Irish Migraine Association has formally requested the establishment of a headache-migraine clinic at Beaumont Hospital.  The association is currently fundraising for this clinic.  Beaumont Hospital's management has confirmed that it supports the establishment of this clinic.  However, it must fall to be considered within the context of the hospital's overall priorities, and the many competing development demands for its acute services.  In this regard, the hospital's management has indicated that such a clinic is not included in its priorities for development in 1998.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concerns expressed regarding a possible link between emissions from the Sellafield plant in Cumbria and the incidence of cancer in County Louth.  However, to date there is no statistically significant evidence of deaths from those cancers, such as certain forms of leukaemia, which are normally associated with ionising radiation. The North-Eastern Health Board has advised that it is developing a range of public health research projects aimed at identifying and addressing the causes of premature morbidity and mortality in County Louth.  The types of study the board are proposing to carry out are as follows: a surveillance system for congenital malformations which would be linked with a similar system in the Eastern Health Board region and would <Col N="1184" /> become part of the EU surveillance system, EUROCAT register; development of small area statistics coded to electoral district level to identify clusters of diseases and blackspots; a lifestyle survey to provide baseline information on various risk factors, and research on the socio-economic factors which prevail in the county.</P>
      <P>Research will be carried out under the overall direction of the health boards' public health department headed by the director of public health.  A variety of risk factors will be taken into account in the studies.</P>
      <P>Regarding the dumping of abestos material referred to by the Deputy, this is primarily a matter for the local authority and the Environmental Protection Agency, who are dealing with the sites in question.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is refering to the means test for the medical card scheme which a person would receive prostheses free of charge.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>The income guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he or she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.  In view of these special provisions, I feel that it is not justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eurocat Register, which includes information on children born with limb defects, began operation in 1980 in the Eastern Health Board area and in Galway.  Eurocat is a birth defect register using a standard approach to coding of information.  It uses population based statistics and multiple sources for its database and produces reports on children born with congenital defects including limb defects.  The register was extended last year to include the Southern Health Board and discussions are advanced in relation to its implementation in the North-Eastern Health Board this year.  Reports are produced by the Central Eurocat Register in Brussels every two years and these show, <i>inter alia,</i> a comparison of limb reductions across Europe.  The most recent figures indicate that while the European average for limb reduction is 6.1 children per <Col N="1187" /> 10,000 births, the figure in Ireland is 4.3 children per 10,000 births.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any research in this country regarding children born with limb defects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208, 219 and 220 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of services to persons with a mental handicap in the Ballinasloe area, County Galway is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  Recently I approved an allocation of £742,000 to the Western Health Board region for the provision of a new residential/respite and day care places in 1998.  A further £270,000 has also been allocated in 1998 to the Western Health Board region to meet identified needs in existing services of which £150,000 was allocated in respect of increased staffing levels at Áras Attracta, Swinford, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board region, including the Galway area, will also benefit from the £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Western Health Board region and the individuals who will benefit from these services have been agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee in line with the priority needs which were identified for the region.  Proposals for the expenditure of this additional funding, as agreed by the regional co-ordinating committee, have now been submitted to my Department and are being examined.  One of the <Col N="1188" /> proposals is an allocation of £122,000 for the development of services for clients with a mental handicap and challenging behaviour at Áras Attracta.  The question of restoring this amount to the Western Health Board does not arise.</P>
    <P>I recently met with the Ballinasloe Advocate for the Mentally Handicapped to discuss their local needs.  These needs are incorporated in the Western Health Board's five year plan for the development of services in the region.  The proposals for new developments in 1998 submitted by the Western Health Board included provision for new residential places in Ballinasloe.</P>
    <P>No further revenue funding can be made available to the Western Health Board region this year.  The need to develop services for clients with challenging behaviour at Áras Attracta was taken into account in allocating the overall amount of additional funding to the Western Health Board region in 1998.  While my Department recognises the need to further develop services at Áras Attracta, any allocation for this purpose from the 1998 additional development funding was solely a matter for decision by the Western Health Board Regional Co-Ordinating Committee, and was not the subject of any instruction from my Department.</P>
    <P>As outlined in both Partnership 2000 for Inclusion, Employment and Competitiveness and An Action Plan for the Millennium, the Government is committed to the ongoing development of services to persons with a mental handicap in line with the needs outlined in the Assessment of Needs.  I am not however in a position to comment on the overall level of revenue funding which may be available for any particular service in future years.</P>

      <P>The arrangements governing entry, which have been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation are designed to ensure that successful applicants are able to provide the high and professional level of service required under the scheme.  In that regard, they provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for guidelines on such matters as assessing the viability of posts, the establishment of interview boards and a marking system for evaluating candidates.  They also provide for prior consultation between the health boards and the IMO in advance of any decision being taken on the matter of whether a post is to be filled.  I am satisfied that the present procedures for GMS entry are equitable and have no plans, at present, to amend them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a report from the North-Eastern Health Board in relation to the matter referred to by the Deputy.  The report states that a schoolchild who was admitted to hospital on Thursday, 5 February was investigated and treated as a case of meningococcal meningitis.  A second child, from the same school but from a different class, who was admitted to hospital on Monday, 9 February was also investigated and treated as a case of meningococcal meningitis.  Both children responded well to treatment.  Household and other close contacts were offered advice and chemoprophylaxis, as recommended in the report of the Working Group on Bacterial Meningitis and Related Conditions.</P>
      <P>Both children were subsequently confirmed as definite cases of meningococcal meningitis group C. In keeping with the recommendations of the Working Group on Bacterial Meningitis and Related Conditions, and with international public health practice, vaccination was then offered to all pupils and staff in the school.  Vaccination is not offered to all pupils in a class or school after a single case of group C infection, or where there are two cases of different strains.</P>
      <P>The health board's report states that, after discussion with the principal of the school, it was decided to circulate letters to parents, informing them of the cases in children who were pupils at the school.  An information meeting was also held in the school, addressed by the Acting Director of Community Care-Medical Officer of Health for County Louth, by a specialist in public health medicine and by an education officer of the Meningitis Research Foundation who had been invited to attend by the board.  The purpose of the letters and the meeting was to inform parents of the situation, to provide information on meningococcal meningitis and to inform them of the board's plans in relation to the cases in the school.  The health board has indicated that, as part of an awareness campaign, in January 1998 it arranged through all schools in its area, for the distribution to parents of an information leaflet about meningitis.</P>
      <P>The Working Group on Bacterial Meningitis, which produced its report in January 1997, made detailed recommendations relating to improved procedures for the diagnosis, surveillance and treatment of meningitis.  The report of the working group does not recommend closure of a school as a measure to deal with occurrences of meningitis.  The working group has continued in existence to monitor the situation and to provide advice on the surveillance and control of meningitis as required.  I have asked the working group to meet again shortly to consider whether there are any further measures or procedures required in the light of recent experience.</P>

      <P>The assessment of entitlement to a blind welfare allowance in any individual case is a matter for the relevant health board.  Accordingly, I have requested the chief executive officer, Eastern Health Board to write directly to the Deputy about this particular case.</P>

      <P>My Department has established that 25 3M Capital Hip System implants, manufactured in the United Kingdom by 3M Healthcare Limited, were distributed in Ireland.  Of these, only nine were actually implanted.  Arrangements have been made with the hospitals involved to have the nine patients who received the implant contacted immediately for review and, where necessary, follow up.  This action has been taken following the receipt of notification from the UK Medical Devices Agency of poor short-term performance associated with the femoral component of this product.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Sligo who was a pensionable officer in the North-Western Health Board has not received her pension rate of pay since February 1996 as medical certification is still provided; the entitlements, if any, she is eligible for under the superannuation scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the North-Western Health Board that the officer concerned had exhausted her entitlement to sick leave on full and half pay. My Department approved payment to her of pension rate of pay for a total period of one year from 7 February 1995.  Such approval is generally only given for a period not exceeding six months; in the case of this officer an extended period of 12 months was approved subject to the condition that the North-Western Health Board was satisfied that there was a reasonable expectation that the officer would be in a position to return to duty and that she had given the board a probable date of return.  My Department has not received any further application from the health board for an extension of this period.</P>
      <P>As time on pension rate of pay is not reckonable as service for superannuation purposes, no superannuation contributions were deducted.  At the date of commencement of pension rate of pay I understand that the officer had total pensionable service of 20 years, including actual service and added years in the event of permanent infirmity.</P>
      <P>Should she be permanently unfit for duty, the officer concerned may apply for retirement on the grounds of permanent infirmity in accordance with the terms of the local government superannuation scheme, which would include both lump sum and pension calculated on the basis of her service.  Her application should be accompanied by a statement from a medical consultant setting out her condition, stating that she is permanently unfit or infirm and that she is incapable of discharging the duties of her post by reason of this permanent condition.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>Roadworthiness testing currently applies to heavy goods vehicles, large trailers, buses and ambulances over one year old and light goods vehicles over four years old and is carried out by authorised testers, generally private garages appointed and supervised by the main local authorities. Vehicles are required to be tested every year with the exception of light goods vehicles which are tested every two years.  Testing is carried out in accordance with detailed requirements laid down in my Department's vehicle testers' manuals.</P>
      <P>The current test fees, exclusive of VAT, are £57 for heavy goods vehicles and buses, £45 for large trailers and ambulances and £30 for light goods vehicles.  These fees also apply where a full retest is carried out.</P>
      <P>It is intended that car testing will be brought into operation early next year.  The selection of a national franchisee to operate the car testing scheme will be the subject of an EU-wide competitive tendering process and the test fee will be one of the key criteria in the assessment of tender proposals.  The costs of compliance with the test standards cannot be precisely estimated and, in the individual case, will vary with the condition of each vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, the standard of roadworthiness required under the car testing scheme will reflect <Col N="1198" /> the current requirements of the Road Traffic Lighting-Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles Regulations, 1963 to 1997.  However, for certain requirements including brakes and emissions, further standards may be specified in regulations or administrative measures relating to the new testing scheme.</P>

      <P>The group mentioned by the Deputy submitted an application for funding under the 1997 scheme of grants for lone parents administered by my Department.</P>

    <P>The purpose of this scheme was to provide funding for initiatives to assist lone parents to <Col N="1204" /> return to work or to take up second chance education and training opportunities.</P>
    <P>Grants were payable under the scheme for: personal development courses; outreach and support initiatives; foundation and pre-vocational skills courses, and childminding and cre che facilities. The emphasis of the scheme is on making relatively small grants to a large number of local groups and the maximum grant available under the scheme is 90 per cent of the cost of the initiative.</P>

    <P>Funding for counselling services was outside the remit of the scheme of grants for lone parents or of any of the other grant schemes administered by my Department in 1997.  Consequently it was not possible to fund the group in 1997.</P>

      <P>From October 1994, the widow's contributory pension scheme was replaced by a new scheme which provides a contributory pension to both widows and widowers on the same terms and conditions.</P>
      <P>While it was not possible to identify the precise number of eligible widowers, initial estimates were that up to 9,000 widowers would qualify for a payment under the new pension scheme.  This excluded widowers who did not have a reckonable PRSI record as well as others already in receipt of a comparable social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this month, a total of 7,898 people were in receipt of a contributory widowers pension.  An extensive advertising campaign was undertaken to ensure that people were informed of the new scheme and advised and assisted in relation to the preparation and submission of application forms.  This included the use of television, radio as well as the national and provincial press and other selected publications.  Details were also displayed on the AERTEL service. This advertising campaign was also supported by the distribution of detailed information leaflets through the Department's network of local offices and through the National Social Service Board and their Citizens Information centres.</P>
      <P>This comprehensive promotion campaign has proved to be successful in informing people of their entitlements under the widow's and widower's contributory pension scheme and my Department will, of course, continue to promote this scheme in the context of its overall information services.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) recommended that all personal rates of social welfare payment should be increased to a minimum adequate level &mdash; £50 in 1985 terms, £70.10 in 1998 terms.</P>
      <P>The following table sets out the various increased payment rates, which were announced in the 1998 budget, as a percentage of the CSW's minimum recommended rate.  As will be seen, all weekly social welfare payment rates, with the exception of two, will be above the CSW's recommended rate, ranging between 101 per cent and 118 per cent.  This means that approximately 833,000 recipients, 94 per cent, will be in receipt of weekly payments which will be above the CSW's recommended rate.  The two payments which will not have reached the CSW's recommended rate are short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, which will move to £68.40 (98 per cent of the CSW's recommended rate).  These payments account for some 57,000 recipients (6 per cent). The full year cost of increasing these rates by £1.70 to £70.10, i.e. the minimum level recommended by the CSW, is approximately £5 million.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the Government is committed to fulfilling the terms of Partnership 2000, which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the minimum rates recommended by the CSW will be implemented before the end of the partnership (1999).</P>

      <P>As announced in the budget last December, the area enterprise allowance under which long-term unemployed persons in designated Partnership areas taking up self-employment can retain 100 per cent of their unemployment assistance payment for a year, has, with effect from 1 January 1998, been extended to the entire country.  The effect of this extension is to remove a long standing anomaly which existed between Partnership areas and non-Partnership areas, thus providing all self-employed applicants coming on to the area allowance with the same level of support irrespective of where they live.</P>
      <P>The practice generally is that people on the area allowance of 100 per cent for a year then move on to back-to-work allowance at 75 per cent of their payment, reducing to 50 per cent and 25 per cent in succeeding years.  There is therefore, in effect, a four year cycle of support for people in this situation.</P>
      <P>The issue referred to in the Deputy's question concerns people outside partnership areas who were already on the 75 per cent rate of support when the extension came into effect, and in particular, whether they should now qualify for payment at the 100 per cent rate.  The issue is whether this is justified, since the people concerned have already taken up self-employment without requiring this high level of support.  This issue is under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that some 1,500 people from non-Partnership areas commenced self-employment in 1997 with the support of the back-to-work allowance at the 75 per cent rate.  The cost of transferring these people to the area enterprise allowance is of the order of £2 million.</P>

      <P>In addition to satisfying a means test, the conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance require that an applicant must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work.  As the Deputy will appreciate, these are statutory conditions which cannot be changed without the relevant legislation being amended.</P>
      <P>Many smallholders supplement their farm income, either themselves or through other members of the household, through employment outside the farm and put themselves outside the limits for entitlement to unemployment assistance as a consequence of that.  In the case of smallholders on unemployment assistance the scheme is in effect a form of income support which tops up the actual net income from working the farm to the appropriate level of unemployment assistance for the particular family circumstances.  People in this category must also fulfil the conditions of being available for and seeking work and are generally able to do so.  There are currently 7,752 smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance under these arrangements.  Other persons claiming unemployment assistance are also subject to a reduction in payment consequent on an increase in means where derived from economic activity.  As the Deputy is aware there is a variety of schemes of support for farming operated by different Departments and there is an ongoing need for co-ordination between the schemes concerned.  It is my view, however, that the smallholders unemployment assistance scheme continues to have an important role in meeting the basic income maintenance needs of this group and I will be seeking to ensure that it operates in a complementary way with the other supports which are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I recently announced, with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, improvements in the method of assessing compensation payments under the rural environment protection scheme (REPS), designed to improve take-up under that scheme, especially by smallholders on social assistance payments.  Under the existing arrangements farmers claiming unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and the old age non-contributory pension can have the first £2,000 of REPS payments disregarded for means test purposes.  Under the revised arrangements, the first £2,000 will continue to be disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50 per cent, rather than on a full pound for pound basis as at present.  This means, for example, that a farmer who receives a REPS payment of £4,000 will now <Col N="1209" /> be £1,000 better off.  This represents a significant improvement in income support for those involved.  I will continue to keep this scheme under review to ensure it operates in an effective way in meeting the income support needs of this group.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to 17 February 1998.  On 21 January 1998 as part of a review of his entitlement he was requested to submit a rent receipt and a letter from his landlord confirming his present address but to date he has failed to forward the required documentation. Payment was disallowed by a deciding officer with effect from 18 February 1998 on the grounds that the claimant had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for entitlement.  When the claimant submits the required documentation the matter will be reviewed.  It is open to him to appeal this decision.</P>

      <P>Under the existing <Col N="1210" /> arrangements farmers claiming unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and the old age non-contributory pension can have the first £2,000 of REPS payments disregarded for means test purposes.  In addition, any costs incurred by farmers in implementing the agri-environmental plan, as provided for under the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, are also offset against other income from farming activities in assessing means.</P>
      <P>The recently published 1998 Social Welfare Bill provides for an extension of this disregard to the new scheme of compensation for compliance with special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs &mdash; conditions, which will be operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  I am pleased to let the Deputy know that the Government has agreed to an additional proposal to further ease the assessment of these compensation payments to farmers.  Under the revised arrangements, the first £2,000 will continue to be disregarded, with the balance being assessed at 50 per cent, rather than on a full pound for pound basis as at present.  This will be of particular importance in areas which contain SACs where farmers will receive higher REPS payments or compensation payments from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in recognition of measures taken to protect these important areas.</P>
      <P>The improvements being made will apply to all farmers on smallholders unemployment assistance throughout the country who participate in REPS or claim compensation from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It is not possible to estimate the number of farmers in County Donegal who will benefit under the revised arrangements.  However, there are currently in the region of 1,200 recipients of smallholders unemployment assistance in County Donegal who could benefit if they opt to participate in REPS or claim compensation for compliance with SAC conditions.</P>
      <P>The improved assessment arrangements will mean, for example, that a farmer on smallholders unemployment assistance who is already in receipt of a REPS payment of £4,000, will now be £1,000 better off.  In addition, a farmer on smallholders unemployment assistance who opts to joint REPS and receives a REPS payment of £4,000 will be £3,000 better off in terms of his overall income position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the High Court judgment in the Griffith case in 1992, the Department treated share fishermen as self-employed contributors for social insurance purposes.</P>
      <P>Following representations from fishermen, their families and other interested parties, a review of the issue was initiated.  In the course of the review it became clear that not all share fishermen worked on the same basis as considered in the High Court case.  As a result new arrangements in relation to social insurance for share fishermen were announced by my predecessor in April 1997.</P>
      <P>These new arrangements are based on the premise that not all share fishermen work on the same basis as applied in the High Court case. Share fishermen working on the basis as considered by the High Court will continue to be liable for social insurance at the self-employed rate.  The new arrangements apply only to those share fishermen employed under a contract of service, that is, where an employer-employee relationship exists.  In the case of such persons the social insurance provisions for employees will apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boat owners, skippers and the people working in the industry are at liberty to negotiate and operate their own work contracts.  Whether these contracts give rise to self-employment or employment depends on work contract negotiated between the indviduals concerned.  In the event of a disagreement on the matter, my Department will investigate the nature of the contract and a deciding officer will decide the nature of the contract on the basis of the facts as presented.  If any <Col N="1212" /> party is dissatisfied with the decision there is a right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.</P>
    <P>Where a share fisherman has worked as an employee since the 1992 judgment and paid social insurance as a self-employed conributor, the Department will treat such contributions as employment contributions on confirmation that he was employed as an employee in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements mean that people in the share fishing industry now have the ability to arrange their work contracts in order to avail of a wide range of social insurance benefits.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence to suggest that the intermittent flooding experienced in the Chapelizod area, which I understand usually occurs during periods of heavy rain, is attributable to drainage in the Phoenix Park.</P>
      <P>However, in late 1996 in an endeavour to reduce the potential for flooding both inside and outside the park, works were carried out to a number of culverts which outfall from the Phoenix Park through Martin's Row and Chapelizod to the Liffey.  Furthermore, a sustained programme of drainage and maintenance is in place in the Phoenix Park to reduce the potential for flooding and ensure that the gulleys are functioning correctly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is referring to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill, 1997, <Col N="1213" /> which passed all Stages in this House on 19 February, 1998, and now goes to Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>That Bill, <i>inter alia,</i> clarifies and extends the powers and functions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in relation to inland waterways.  It defines an &ldquo;inland waterway&rdquo; as meaning any river or lake, including canalised sections of a river or lake, navigation or canal specified in the Schedule to the Bill.  The inland waterways specified in the Schedule are the Grand Canal, including the Barrow navigation, the Royal Canal, the Shannon navigation, the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation, the Erne and Lough Oughtar navigation and that part of the Ulster Canal located in the State, Both the Grand Canal, including the Barrow navigation, and the stretch of the Royal Canal from Dublin to Mullingar are open to navigation, but they are currently temporarily closed to navigation to enable works to be carried out.  The Grand Canal will be re-opened by April 1998. The stretch of the Royal Canal from Mullingar to the Shannon is not navigable, but it is currently being restored and it is hoped to have it fully open to navigation by the year 2001.</P>
      <P>The main navigation channel on the Shannon River is fully open from Lough Allen to Killaloe, as is the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  New projects include the extension of the Shannon navigation to Ballinasloe via the River Suck which will be navigable in early 1999 and the extension of the Shannon navigation to Boyle which should be completed in the year 2000.  Another major project is taking place at Limerick to improve navigation south of Killaloe.  The Ulster Canal is not navigable, but it is currently the subject of a cross-Border joint study in relation to the feasibility of its restoration. The question of possible restoration of that navigation will be considered in the light of the findings of the feasibility study.</P>

      <P>A report entitled, The Conservation of the Natural Heritage of North West Mayo, which was jointly commissioned by Mayo County Council and my Department examined several possible locations, including Ballycroy, as sites for a visitor centre.  I am at present considering this report and I hope to make a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is, however, unrealistic at this stage to expect that the proposed visitor centre will be provided before the end of 1999, that is the deadline for completion of projects funded under the current tourism operational programme for 1994-99.  It has been decided, therefore, to proceed with the necessary planning of the building at a location to be decided on with a view to implementing the project under the next tranche of European Regional Development Fund funds.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed national park, I hope that a meeting between officials of Dúchas &mdash; the heritage service of my Department &mdash; and the Ballycroy Community Council to discuss progress in relation to the proposed national park will take place shortly.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the lands of the person in question have attracted large numbers of Greenland white fronted geese and whooper swans for a number of years because of the high quality grass.  Geese and swans are strictly protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and are included in Annex 1 of the Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds.  As Annex 1 species, member states are required to take particular measures to ensure the protection of these species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> There is no provision for the payment of compensation under the Wildlife Act, 1976, for damage done by wild animals on birds.  However, there is provision under section 42 of the Act that where protected wild birds are causing damage to, <i>inter alia,</i> livestock, poultry or agricultural crops either on pasture or on cultivated land, permission may be given to the owner or occupier of the property to take such steps as necessary to prevent the damage.  A permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, was issued by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, on 16 October 1997 valid to 30 April 1998 enabling the person concerned to scare away the protected geese and swans on these lands by the use of bangers.</P>
    <P>The boundary of Lough Iron special protection area, which lies adjacent to the lands in question is being reviewed as part of an ongoing overall review of SPA sites by Dúchas, the heritage service. Given the level of use of these lands by geese and swans, these lands would most likely be proposed for inclusion in the SPA.  The inclusion of these lands within the SPA would entitle the landowner to additional payments under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, REPS, operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>

      <P>The person concerned wrote to me last August complaining about various matters arising out of legal proceedings in which he was involved.  In the course of a lengthy reply, which issued to him on 3 October 1997, certain courses of action were suggested that might be open to him in the pursuit of his complaints.  It would appear from a recent letter he sent to me that he was not happy with that reply.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court, in its judgment of 19 June 1997, found two aspects of the Equal Status Bill, 1997, to be repugnant to the Constitution.  These were section 43 (3) which related to the admission as evidence in a criminal prosecution of facts in a document certified by the Director of Equality Investigations and section 71, which provided, <i>inter alia</i>, for vicarious liability of employers in relation to criminal offences.  Both sections were identical to provisions of the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, which had earlier been found to be unconstitutional and a finding of unconstitutionality in respect of the Equal Status Bill was, therefore, inevitable.  The Supreme Court declined to consider the constitutionality of any other provisions of the Equal Status Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, which is currently before the Seanad, the provisions which correspond to sections 43 (3) and 71 of the Equal Status Bill, 1997, have been redrafted to meet the Supreme Court's requirements and it is <Col N="1222" /> intended that similar revisions will be made to the equal status legislation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, legal advice has been sought on all constitutional issues raised following the referral of the Equal Status Bill, 1997, to the Supreme Court.  The revised equal status legislation, which it is intended to publish later this year, will be developed in accordance with that advice.</P>
    <P>The implications, including benefits that would accrue to people with a disability, of any constitutional change required to facilitate the rights of such people, are being considered in my Department and decisions in this regard will be taken by Government as necessary following the enactment of the Employment Equality Bill and Equal Status Bill.</P>

I do not propose to make an exception to that practice in this instance.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that each application for temporary release is given due consideration having regard to a number of factors including the purpose for which the release is sought, the nature of the offence committed by the prisoner and the amount of the sentence served.  I can confirm also that good behaviour is something that is expected of all prisoners who are granted temporary release but that it is not something which, on its own, would necessarily ground a case for full early release of a prisoner.</P>

      <P>It has been policy for some time not to provide support for tourist accommodation projects on the basis of the proven ability of the commercial accommodation sector to respond, without grant assistance, to growth in visitor numbers.</P>
      <P>This approach was incorporated into the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993, agreed with the European Commission and, by and large, carried forward into the current operational programme.  The current programme did make an exception in the case of a number of specific market segments by providing for limited grant aid for certain specialist accommodation where the quality of existing accommodation was recognised to be deficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1228" /> However, already, all funds in this regard under the programme are fully committed.  Under the mid-term review of the programme no additional funding became available for the product development sub-programme.</P>
    <P>Other EU-funded programmes which provide support for smaller tourism initiatives, including accommodation, are the programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry and the Leader II programme administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  There is also the local, urban and rural development operational programme under which, <i>inter alia</i>, the county enterprise boards operate.  In the Border counties, limited assistance is also available under the IFI and INTERREG programmes and the Programmes for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Additionally, all registered and approved tourism accommodation was eligible for low interest loans under the access to finance scheme launched in September 1995 under the small business operational programme.  Since £52 million of this £208 million fund was specially earmarked for tourism projects throughout the country but the target was actually exceeded with the allocation of over £56 million &mdash; 27 per cent of the fund &mdash; to tourism.  A similar scheme especially for the Border counties was introduced under the Peace and Reconciliation Fund and all of it has now been committed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, investment in registered or approved tourist accommodation in any of the resort areas designated under the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas may also qualify for generous tax reliefs under the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teaching posts to primary schools.  In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.  A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need and within available resources.  There is no set enrolment figure which automatically attracts a remedial teacher post. The main criterion applied in the selection process is the number of children who have been assessed as being at or below the 10th percentile on appropriate standardised tests of attainment.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools in question will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 320, 330 and 331 together.</P>
      <P>The Universities Act, 1997 was commenced with effect from 16 June, 1997.  In accordance with section 23 of the Act, I appointed commissions for the various universities to determine the composition of the first governing authority of each university.  A statutory deadline of three months applied to the work of the commissions and each commission duly reported to me within this timeframe.</P>
      <P>Section 16 of the Universities Act, 1997 sets out the parameters for the composition of the university governing authorities.  In accordance with these statutory provisions and the deliberations of the individual commissions, I was entitled to nominate three members to the governing authorities in the case of University of Limerick, National University of Ireland, Cork, National University of Ireland, Dublin, Dublin City University and National University of Ireland, Galway and two members in the case of National University of Ireland, Maynooth.  When selecting my nominees, I was required to consult with the chief officer of the relevant university and was also required to ensure that there were at least two nominees from within my nominees and those of the representative organisations, who were nominated by organisations representative of business or industry or who, in my opinion, were representative of business or industry, I was statutorily prohibited from nominating an employee or a student of the individual university and I was also required to ensure a gender balance from within my nominees.  My nominees to the governing authorities of the various universities are set out in the following schedule and I am confident that each nominee will contribute significantly to the work of the various governing authorities.</P>
      <P>The present position is that first meetings of the new governing authorities have been held in the following universities on the following dates:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 325, 344 and 345 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to national schools in County Kerry which do not currently have a remedial service, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 494 of 2 December 1997.</P>
      <P>The additional information requested by the Deputies is not readily available in my Department. However, I have asked my Department to compile the information in question and to forward it to the Deputies as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial or resource teaching posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a remedial teaching service.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial and resource teacher areas, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the areas in question will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial and resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>The planning group for the national educational psychological service is to report to me within the next two months.  It is examining the <Col N="1238" /> current availability of psychological services to children and young people, and will be making recommendations as to the developments which will be necessary in order to ensure effective provision for the future.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that the planning group will recommend the adoption of any one specific ratio of psychologist to children.  This is because the level of need will vary according to circumstances. In assigning psychologists to schools, account will be taken of such factors as the level of socio-economic disadvantage, whether there has previously been a schools' psychological service and the availability of other psychological services provided by health boards and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department provides a psychologocal service to national schools designated as disadvantaged in the city of Cork.  The provisions of psychological assessments for national schools in the county of Cork is a matter for the directors of community care of the regional health board, as is the issue of waiting lists.</P>
      <P>In order to meet the current need for a psychological service in the primary sector, my Department is recruiting, in collaboration with Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick, 15 qualified psychologists to be employed on three year contracts.  These psychologists will be taking up their duties during the current term, and details of the areas to which they will be assigned will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>My Department does not prescribe minimum entry qualifications for PLC programmes. In inviting applications each year to participate in the programme, schools and colleges are reminded that ESF aid towards the cost of these courses is received on the basis that they enhance the employment prospects of young people whose skills are inadequate for the labour market; that priority for admission should therefore be accorded to applicants on the basis of need, and that these courses are suitable for those who have completed senior cycle or a VPT-1 programme or requivalent.</P>
      <P>A special tabulation extracted from the 1995 ESRI annual school leavers survey indicates that 19 per cent of PLC participants achieved less than five Ds at leaving certificate, and a further 33 per cent achieved no honours, while 38 per cent achieved between one and three honours.  The programme therefore attracts a wide variety of participants in terms of attainment levels prior to entry.</P>
      <P>Preparation for interviews and interview techniques are a normal part of senior cycle programmes provided under the guidance service, and as part of transition year, leaving certificate applied and leaving certificate vocational programmes.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any particular difficulties in accessing PLC courses.  However, I will be happy to investigate the matter if details of any problems are made available to my Department by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 338 together.</P>
      <P>The State carries its own insurable risks and does not insure against such risks as a matter of general policy.  These arrangements have been extended to community and comprehensive schools who are relieved of the onus and cost of effecting insurance cover.  These arrangements are from time to time to ensure that the most cost effective insurance arrangements apply in the sector.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this has caused undue delay or increased costs in respect of this school or generally.  My Department has acted swiftly and taken a number of steps to rectify the damage caused by fire at Crescent College Comprehensive School, Dooradoyle, Limerick.</P>
      <P>A senior architect from the planning and building unit of my Department visited the school the day after the fire, consultants were employed and immediate approval was given for the clearance of the fire damaged area and necessary safety works.</P>
      <P>Prefabricated accommodation was put in place. The renovation of home economics rooms and remedial internal works took place during the course of last year.</P>
      <P>The library project which is currently under construction at Crescent College Comprehensive was at an advanced stage of architectural planning at the time the fire occurred and it was considered more appropriate to allow it to proceed to construction and to deal with the works arising as a result of the fire as separate projects.</P>
      <P>The board of management of the school was involved in all decisions made in relation to works at the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of the replacement accommodation requires a very substantial degree of technical <Col N="1241" /> and professional input in order to complete the architectural planning process which is currently at Stage 3, that is developed sketch scheme, of my Department's design team procedures.</P>
    <P>It is intended that this project will progress speedily through the architectural design process and proceed to tender and construction as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the condition of the Rathmore boys national school building is not satisfactory and the existing school site is confined. Among the options which had to be considered were the renovation of the existing school building, the possibility of using the vocational school building which will become surplus to requirements at the end of this school year or the acquisition of a new site and provision of a new school building.  It would appear that renovation of the existing building or the use of the vocational school are not satisfactory options.</P>
      <P>It has proved difficult to identify a suitable site. One site proposed is at distance of 1.5 miles from the current school location.

I will respond directly to the board of management when the review has been completed.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, the supply panel scheme was extended by the provision of a further 30 teachers.  The scheme now operates in 17 locations throughout the country serving a large number of schools.</P>
      <P>In the context of the development of the scheme, it was necessary to redress difficulties which had presented during the pilot phase. Accordingly, a reduction in the number of supply teachers in some locations was deemed appropriate to ensure a more efficient management of the scheme.  A consequence of this action was a reduction in the number of schools in these areas benefiting from the scheme.  I should stress that the reduction in supply teachers in some locations was accompanied by an increase in the number of teachers in other locations.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers was one of the schools excluded following the changes to the pilot scheme.  I should emphasise, however, that the school in question is still entitled to engage substitute teachers when necessary from outside of the panel scheme.</P>
