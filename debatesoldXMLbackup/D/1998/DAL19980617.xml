      <P>I understand the concerns being expressed by the Fine Gael Party.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that in order for this report to be published and enjoy the privilege of the House it has to form part of a report of one of the operating committees of the House of which Deputy Ferris is Chair?  Will he also confirm that what is being done is a device to refer this to the committee so that it can take the matter on board as part of its overall report to enable it to come into the public domain so that its contents can be properly and fully debated, over a succession of meetings if necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, indicated that the Taoiseach would be in contact with us on the question of legislation to give effect to paragraph 4 of the section on prisoners in the British-Irish Agreement.  Could the Taoiseach inform the House what the position is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to correct an inaccurate statement which I made on radio this morning.  I was in fact briefed by telephone late last night by one of the senior officials in the Taoiseach's Department, but I incorrectly stated that I had not been briefed. <Col N="1003" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I told the leaders of the Opposition parties that they would be briefed late last week.  Yesterday evening I realised that they had not been briefed.  I regret that.  They should have received the briefing late last week. They will have received it by now or will get it during the day.</P>
      <P>What the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, said yesterday was on advice received by the Government on the Offences Against the State Act, l939, and the Criminal Justice Act, l960, in particular, which covers temporary releases and capital and repatriation cases.  The matter has not yet been brought to Government and I have not made a final decision.  I am conscious of the wording of paragraph 4 and of how it could be interpreted. The leaders of the Opposition will be briefed and we will see then what is the best way to proceed. I do not want to create difficulties regarding the paragraph.  I want the Agreement dealt with in the full course of time in a proper way, and that includes paragraph 40.  Even though the law covers this matter &mdash; I have checked it a number of times, as others probably have &mdash; there is more to it than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has said.  On the basis of what I have been informed, and our own analysis, notwithstanding that the law in its current format probably does provide for the release of prisoners, there is a net political point here and this Oireachtas is honour bound to introduce specific legislation to give full effect to paragraph 4 of the section on prisoners. However, we will await the full briefing and the correspondence from the Taoiseach and we will then move more formally on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the 1960 legislation was passed to deal with entirely different circumstances?  Presumably the briefing now available would also have been available to the Government when it negotiated the British-Irish Agreement and the commitment it gave to legislation.  Will the Taoiseach agree that in any event, whether by legislation, motion or some other method, the precise grounds for distinguishing between those prisoners who will be released early and those who will not, who have committed the same offences but with different organisational links, should be explicitly approved in this House so that it will be seen that matters of this nature involving human liberty are decided on the basis of clearly transparent rules, approved democratically, and not on the basis of administrative discretion by a Minister in a way that is not accountable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that on the basis of the Agreement there is a need for legislation if only to confirm that we are complying with what we agreed to.  While the 1939 Offences Against the State Act and the 1960 Criminal Justice Act provide some powers to Government, <Col N="1004" /> they may not be sufficient or adequate for the commitment we made in the Agreement.  We need to examine the precise powers more closely because my recollection is that there were some difficulties under the last Administration in relation to the release of prisoners subsequent to the IRA and loyalist ceasefires.  The matter is not as clear-cut as may be presented by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to consult with the Opposition leaders in this matter, and that process is under way.  Paragraph 4 refers to &ldquo;Governments&rdquo; and, at the time, the discussion in Belfast was primarily about the way the British Government would deal with this issue.  The question of what would happen did not arise.  It was stated at the time that we had legislation in place to cover this but, to be frank, anyone reading paragraph 4 would be of the view that both Governments would introduce legislation.  The advice on this matter is strong.  I do not want to debate the legislation but the powers exist in legislation to do what we have agreed to do.  However, there is a political point, as Deputy Quinn stated, and I am conscious of following a consistent line in regard to paragraph 4 and every other section of the Agreement.  If we go down that road I would ask for the co-operation of the House to allow us deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but we normally do not introduce legislation in this House when legislation is already on the Statute Book.  We do not introduce legislation for fun but for a reason.  In this case I have outlined the reason we would do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach made a remark <i>vis-à-vis</i> myself and I should have the right to <Col N="1005" /> reply.  It is important that matters concerning the liberty of individuals &mdash; keeping some people in jail and letting others out &mdash; should be approved in this House and should not be a matter for private administrative discretion.  The Taoiseach knew that when he agreed in Belfast legislation would be introduced.  That it is not necessary does not mean it cannot be done.  There are many instances of consolidating legislation that repeats existing provisions, so there is no problem with fulfilling this commitment even if, in some respects, it repeats the 1960 legislation.  I would like to know why the Taoiseach is so angry about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my suggestion.  This is not being put on a private administrative basis.  It is legally underpinned by two legislative measures.  I am trying to adhere to the letter of the law and ensure that an agreement to which I signed my name is properly upheld.  That is all I am trying to do.  I am not trying to find a way out of it.  There are two existing legislative measures. The Attorney General and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform do not believe legislation is required but I am anxious that we act properly in regard to what is contained in paragraph 4.  I am not getting annoyed about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a promise in the programme for Government to publish legislation to provide a social services inspectorate and to introduce legislation in relation to mandatory reporting.  Both of these matters have been put on the long finger by the Government.  In the light of what we now know of the recommendations contained in Dr. Murphy's report, which will be available to this House this evening but which <Col N="1006" /> have been published in some of our newspapers this morning, does the Government intend to give priority of any nature to either of these two legislative measures?  In the context of the social services inspectorate, will the Taoiseach explain why, having given a commitment to this House at the beginning of the year that the inspectorate would be formed on an administrative basis in advance of the legislation being published, nobody has yet been recruited and we currently do not have any such inspectorate?  Will he explain also whether the matter is being held up by the Government, the Department of Finance or whether the Minister for Health and Children has gone to sleep on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of child protection legislation, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is giving priority to that matter.  On the inspectorate, the child care services inquiries Bill was removed from the legislative programme in view of the urgency of establishing a social services inspectorate.  It has been decided to proceed with that on an administrative basis.  It is envisaged that the inspectorate will be located in the Department of Health and Children.  The general powers of the Minister for Health and Children, and specific powers provided in section 69 of the Child Care Act, will underpin its administrative guarantees and arrangements.  In the longer term, it is accepted that the inspectorate will need to be established on a statutory basis and the drafting of the legislation will be informed by the practical experience of the inspectorate.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why a commitment was first given to this House last November, and repeated upon the reconvening of the House after the Christmas vacation, that the social services inspectorate would be established as a matter of priority on an administrative basis?

A promise to publish the Bill in this session does not mean it will become an Act of Parliament. Why has the commitment in this regard not been fulfilled?  That should be a priority, as should the issue raised by Deputy Shatter.  The Bill should be on the Statute Book to give effect to our international obligations in terms of the protection of children.

      <P>Local consultative committees will comprise representatives of the members and officials of the appointing authority and representatives of local travellers and traveller bodies.  The proposed parameters for the representation of each group are intended to ensure a balance of representation and reflect experience of a number of different approaches followed by some local authorities in recent years.</P>
      <P>The purpose for which the committees are being set up is to improve participation of travellers in the planning, design and management of their accommodation.  The question of involvement by other local and community groups was considered carefully.  On the basis that other channels are now available to local communities to express their views &mdash; for example, the opportunity for the public to have an input to an accommodation programme and the ending of the exemption of halting sites from the planning consultation procedures which apply to local authority developments in their own functional areas &mdash; it was decided that community groups have an adequate input at the general policy levels and to individual projects.  The strategic policy committees being established by local authorities will provide a further mechanism for consulting community groups about housing issues, including traveller accommodation.  I look forward to hearing the views of other Members on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III sets out some miscellaneous but important provisions, including a provision to <Col N="1011" /> strengthen the powers of housing authorities to control unauthorised temporary dwellings and to deal with serious anti-social behaviour on halting sites.  Sections 25 and 26 provide for the inclusion in development plans of appropriate objectives for the provision of accommodation for travellers and the use of particular areas for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I want the voluntary sector to play a greater role in the provision of purpose built accommodation for travellers.  That sector already has a track record in the provision of standard housing and the allocation of such units to travellers. There is scope for their becoming involved in other types of accommodation. The assistance to approved voluntary bodies under the capital assistance scheme is also available at the maximum rates in respect of halting sites.  To date, however, no proposal for such a site has been developed, but we will continue to encourage voluntary bodies to become involved in this area.</P>
    <P>The basic power of local authorities to provide, improve, manage and control sites for caravans is contained in section 13 of the Housing Act, 1988. Some further clarification of the provisions in that section is required.  Section 28 of the Bill, therefore, provides that a housing authority has power to provide sites with different levels of services related to their intended use, including permanent residential sites, temporary sites pending the provision of permanent accommodation, alternative sites during periods of redevelopment of existing sites, basic services in the absence of proper accommodation and transient halting sites.</P>
    <P>A new provision is being inserted which will enable the Minister to issue guidelines on services and facilities to be provided on sites.  Details of the level of services to be provided will be fleshed out in these guidelines.  Revised guidelines on permanent residential caravan parks were issued last October following consultation with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group.  Preparation of further guidelines in the series is well advanced, again in consultation with the group.</P>
    <P>Unauthorised encampments continue to be a source of concern and complaint from the public. I recognise and accept the problem of unauthorised encampments is largely related to the lack of suitable permanent accommodation.  The efforts of local authorities, in line with the general thrust of the Bill, must continue to be concentrated on meeting the needs for permanent accommodation. However, there are, and will continue to be, circumstances in which local authorities cannot tolerate unauthorised encampments on health, safety and environmental grounds.  Effective powers to deal with such situations must be available to the authorities and are contained in section 3.  The improvements proposed introduce a greater degree of flexibility in operating the existing controls which are set out in section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, <Col N="1012" /> 1992.  Under its provisions housing authorities will be able to take action where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is located within five miles of a serviced site provided by any housing authority or voluntary body and where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is in poor condition or interferes with amenities or is, or is likely to be, a risk to personal or public health or safety.  In these circumstances no maximum distance is specified as to where the alternative accommodation should be.  Housing authorities will also be able to take action where an unauthorised temporary dwelling is within one mile of any traveller accommodation provided by the housing authority or approved voluntary body.</P>
    <P>Powers of local authorities under the planning Acts in relation to unauthorised development, under the roads Acts in relation to safety aspects, and other controls under environmental and public health legislation will remain.  Proper management of residential caravan parks and halting sites is necessary in the interests of gaining public acceptance for sites and the quality of life of the residents on the site and in the immediate vicinity. A number of important initiatives have already been taken to promote the use of best practice in estate management in local authority housing schemes.  A scheme of financial assistance for housing authorities in respect of the management and maintenance costs for traveller specific accommodation has been introduced. Under this scheme the development of partnership arrangements between local authorities and travellers is being encouraged.  These proactive initiatives need to be underpinned by adequate statutory backing in relation to problems of an anti-social nature which may arise on sites.  Therefore, relevant powers under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, in relation to anti-social behaviour on housing estates are being extended to sites for caravans, including permanent residential parks for caravans, transient sites and temporary facilities.  The anti-social behaviour provisions already apply to group housing schemes.</P>
    <P>I have set out in some detail the provisions of the Bill and its background.  It represents a comprehensive and balanced response by the Government to the difficulties experienced over a long period in seeking to meet the accommodation needs of travellers.  The Bill provides housing authorities with a clear legal framework for addressing their accommodation needs.  It clarifies their obligations and strengthens their powers as housing authorities.  It provides for consultation with travellers and the general public.  The Bill, together with the changes in the planning consultation process, ensures that the planning, design and management of traveller accommodation proposals will be the subject of extensive consultation.  This is essential if we are to address concerns on the part of travellers and the settled community and to overcome the long delays experienced by housing authorities in seeking to provide accommodation.  I am pleased, therefore, <Col N="1013" /> to commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to strong support for the Bill and the objectives it seeks to achieve.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael welcomes the publication of this Bill and will support the Second Stage.  I congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Wallace.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will pass on my congratulations to the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy &mdash; I am sure he will regard it as a first.  I congratulate him and his Department on finalising the content of this legislation which has been the source of much discussion in recent years.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said in the Seanad last month, the Bill seeks to implement the broad range of recommendations announced in the national strategy for traveller accommodation adopted by the previous Government.  Many sections also relate directly to proposals put forward by the task force on the travelling community which reported to Government in 1995.</P>
      <P>I also pay tribute to Deputy McManus for her work in this area of policy during our time in Government from 1994 to 1997.  It is not an exaggeration to say this Bill has been in a state of gestation for some time.  While Fine Gael will support the Second Reading, we will seek to make a number of commonsense amendments to the legislation when it comes before the Select Committee on Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The problem of providing traveller accommodation represents one of the most significant challenges facing local government.  One would be foolish not to recognise that when a local authority attempts to provide accommodation for travellers, it will invariably come face to face with a clash of cultures.  How local authorities can provide much needed accommodation while, at the same time, attempting to address the genuine fears of the settled community is best described as a circle which is virtually impossible to square. Those of us who make law in this House must be mindful of the huge difficulties which face local authorities and county and corporation councillors throughout the country.  We seem to forget that locally elected councillors receive an unfair share of criticism from all sides of this debate.  It is crucial, therefore, that when this Bill is enacted, its provisions are watertight, the responsibilities it places on officials and councillors are clear and, most importantly, it will not end up in the courts on a point of interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that much of the legislation in this area to date has been poorly drafted and that, as a result, millions of pounds of taxpayers' money has been frittered away in seeking to give force to the law through the courts.  That needless waste of resources will only cease when the law <Col N="1014" /> we enact is clear and to the point.  The Government should make time on Committee Stage to analyse the Bill in detail because of the importance of the point of interpretation in the courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to implement a nationally designed policy for the provision of traveller accommodation.  It seeks to put in place a five year accommodation programme in each of the relevant housing authorities.  While there has been some progress in the provision of halting sites, group housing schemes and standard accommodation for travellers, the pace of the accommodation programme and the general range of accommodation provided have not followed a systematic national trend.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities, particularly in the Dublin area, have provided a range of accommodation to facilitate some people within the travelling community.  However, there are countless examples of local authorities which have refused to address in any meaningful way their responsibility to house the travelling community.  This can be seen in the latest figures on the number of traveller families who live in unofficial encampments. It is a sad reflection on the pace of progress in this area and an indictment on us all that between November 1996 and November 1997 the number of traveller families living in unofficial encampments increased from 1,040 to 1,127 families.</P>
    <P>According to the 1996 census, the total traveller population is just over 10,000 persons.  This represents a small fraction of the total population. How can a small proportion of our people be the subject of such a sustained and contested debate on providing basic accommodation and shelter? The traveller population does not represent a significant proportion of the population, nor does it undermine the position of the settled community.</P>
    <P>How has the relationship between the traveller and the settled person become such an issue of conflict and discord?  There is much misunderstanding and prejudice between both communities which have contributed to a deterioration in their relationship.  It is our job as politicians to show leadership.  That will require making difficult choices and setting out clearly to both communities the fears and apprehensions of the other.  I am greatly concerned that the complete lack of communication between the traveller and settled community has helped to create more fear and misunderstanding, particularly among younger members of both communities.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the settled community looked out for the traveller, when it provided clothes for traveller children who were making their First Holy Communion or Confirmation, when it expected a weekly or monthly call from a local traveller in the area and when both communities worked together.  However, that is no longer the case.  The proliferation of housing estates and the intense urbanisation which has occurred have allowed many members of the settled community to feel that the traveller is an outcast or someone who is so undesirable they <Col N="1015" /> do not want to come in contact with them.  It is inevitable, therefore, that prejudice and intolerance will flourish.</P>
    <P>It is important to see this Bill as an attempt to change mindsets and to actively encourage both communities to engage in dialogue with each other.  If we are serious about bringing both communities closer together, we must provide in law an inclusive framework which will encourage and facilitate that.  I use the term &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; because there are sections of this Bill which are distinctly exclusive.  This State must not attempt to create new divisions between the traveller and settled community.  I refer specifically to the provisions of section 21 which allow for the establishment of local traveller consultative committees.  By specifically excluding the settled community from membership of such committees, the Minister is giving it an opportunity to opt out of its responsibilities.</P>
    <P>This process must be inclusive if we want it to work.  We cannot offer a hiding place for people who wish to opt out of the proposed legislation. It is imperative that we seek maximum agreement and co-operation.  If that cannot be achieved, section 14 gives the county manager power to implement the programme.  My advice to the Minister and the Government is to involve as many groups as possible in the process to increase potential understanding between both communities.</P>
    <P>I want to dwell on the issue of prejudice and to put on record the work of a former lecturer of mine, Fr. Micheál Mac Gréil, who, in his recent publication, <i>Prejudice in Ireland Revisited</i>, looked at inter-group relations in Ireland.  Through exhaustive questioning and survey work, Fr. Mac Gréil found that only one in seven of the national sample would welcome a traveller into the family through marriage.  In a statistic which is of relevance to the issue of traveller accommodation, he found that 59 per cent of the national sample would not welcome travellers as their next door neighbours.  I found it astonishing that over three quarters of the national sample would hesitate to seek the company of travellers, while 56 per cent would avoid a traveller in social situations.</P>
    <P>Weber said that &ldquo;prejudice was an attitude, usually negative, about people based on their membership of a group&rdquo;.  That is a good definition of the term.  If we want to change inter-group relations we must provide in law a place for all groups in society, whether they are travellers or settled people, so they can share in the consultation and decision-making process.  We will not eliminate prejudice if we exclude any group from that process.</P>
    <P>It is important to outline a number of facts about the traveller population.  Some 50 per cent of the total traveller population is under 14 years of age, compared to 24 per cent of the population generally.  It is a scandal that only 1.3 per cent of the total traveller population is over 65 years of age.  Compare this to 12 per cent of the settled <Col N="1016" /> population who are 65 and over.  The average age of a traveller in 1996 was 14 years and the average age in the general population was 31 years.  The average household size for travellers is 4.9 persons compared to 3.1 persons nationally.  Traveller families have 3.5 children compared to 1.8 children for the population at large.</P>
    <P>It is clear under a number of headings that the traveller population of Ireland suffer high rates of mortality.  It is also the case because of their nomadic lifestyle that health provisions and education facilities are not as available to the traveller as they are to the settled community.  It is interesting to note there has been a move in some sections of the traveller population to seek standard accommodation or group housing schemes from local authorities.  This form of accommodation can obviously promote a more healthy lifestyle that cannot be found on the side of the road. If people choose a nomadic form of existence it follows that the same standards of social service provision &mdash; health, education &mdash; cannot be provided.</P>
    <P>I found it interesting in recent days to discover that in many counties the vast majority of travelling families live in standard accommodation.  For example, in the city of Galway, out of a total of 184 families in its administrative area, 113 families live in standard accommodation.  In the Galway County Council area 189 families live in standard accommodation out of a total of 291 families.  In the Kerry County Council area 171 families, out of a total of 213, live in standard accommodation.  In Longford, out of a total of 137 families, 116 live in standard accommodation. It is not unfair to suggest there has been a trend in recent times for travellers to consciously decide to move into more permanent accommodation, by way of standard accommodation provided by local authorities, or the group housing schemes. Whether that is coming from elements within the traveller community is a matter for debate.  We must recognise it for what it is, that consciously a large section of the traveller community is not choosing the nomadic form of existence, as did their forefathers.  The impression given by some of the travelling community, that the nomadic way of life represents the life of a majority within the total population would not seem to be borne out from the experience of local authorities, particularly in the west.  It would seem that travellers are making a conscious choice to seek standard accommodation from local authorities, for most of the year at least.</P>
    <P>It is important in this Bill to say we are not just referring to halting sites in the context of accommodation programmes.  Traveller accommodation can take many shapes and forms and if the experience in the west is anything to go on, it would seem that more and more travellers are availing of the option of taking standard accommodation.</P>
    <P>The experience of attempting to deal with the problem of finding halting sites in the Dublin area has been severely hampered by the actions of <Col N="1017" /> some groups which have incurred colossal legal costs through court injunctions on Dublin local authorities.  In my local authority of south Dublin, more than £250,000 has been spent by that authority dealing with actions taken by some representatives of the traveller community.  We will not make progress together as long as local authorities have to shell out huge sums of money on legal fees.  It is wasted expenditure and it is completely unnecessary.  When one considers that the total budget in south Dublin is some £80 million, that the legal costs involved in cases were £175 million in 1997, and the cost involved in dealing with unauthorised sites is in excess of £300,000, one can see it is a huge drain on local authorities. That sum of money cannot be recouped from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <P>If a traveller moves from Galway to South Dublin County Council I regard that as a national issue but my local authority cannot seek recoupment from the Department of the Environment and Local Government of the costs associated with unofficial sites in my council area.  This is of great concern to local authorities.  It is a drain on their expenditure.  It is now the case that within community departments throughout most Dublin authorities a considerable period is wasted on court injunctions.  Is it in the common good that those injunctions be taken, particularly when we require people to work together?</P>
    <P>Respect is a two-way process.  There has been an obvious lack of respect among the settled community for the traveller community in recent times.  That is clear from the work completed by Fr. Mac Gréil on the social distance between the two groups.  There has also been a lack of respect among travellers for the settled community. There are norms within the settled community that have to be respected.  It is a point of considerable discord for residents throughout the Dublin area and other parts of the country that public spaces are destroyed, as a result of unofficial sites. This does not help to engender good relations between both communities.  Respect is a two-way process.  We have to work on this together.  I hope, in the course of Committee Stage through the various amendments proposed by my party, we will enshrine in the legislation that respect and mutual understanding which is a two-way process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  I congratulate and thank also Deputy Liz McManus for her work in this area as chairperson of the task force prior to becoming a Minister of State.  I will hone in on a number of matters but will not cover the entire Bill.  It is unfortunate that a number of local authorities have to be forced to live up to their responsibilities.  That is the reality we have to face.  Without the legislation and without being forced to do so they will not live up to their responsibilities.  I hope the Bill has no loophole which would enable any council to avoid its responsibilities.  I had thought the number <Col N="1018" /> of travelling families on the roadside was decreasing because of the provision of accommodation in recent years.  On reading the Seanad debate I was surprised to find this is not the case. In the past five years, while an additional 849 families have been provided with accommodation, in the same period the number of traveller families on the roadside has fallen by only 53 from 1,180 to 1,127 families.  That was a source of some surprise to me.  I am not sure I fully understand the reasons and perhaps the Minister in his reply will explain the situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes referred to the health problems of the travelling community.  This is a matter to which too much attention cannot be paid.  He has elaborated on some of their specific problems, for example, that only two out of every 100 travellers live to 65 years of age.  The infant mortality rate is nearly three times the national average.  Sixty-five years of age was the life expectancy level which people had as far back as the 1940s.  These statistics make depressing reading.  We cannot fudge the issue.  We have got to deal with the health problems of the travelling community.  I am particularly concerned about the position of children.  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for children I give some thought to this issue on occasions, particularly on cold, wet or frosty mornings, when passing certain encampments where children are running around half naked.  Surely we and the Minister for Health and Children have some responsibility in this matter? Adults can look after themselves as they, in most instances, have made a choice that this is the lifestyle they want but the children have no choice in the matter, the choice is made for them.</P>
      <P>I recognise there is a certain sensitivity here. People say that travellers have a right to their culture. I understand and I accept that.  My experience in the North of Ireland would probably make me realise that more than other people. The necessity to accommodate difference is extremely important.  However, where culture leads to a situation in which young people are deprived, where they do not have a choice in the matter and living the sort of lives which these children are forced to live, then I wonder if the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; deserves to be used in this context.</P>
      <P>I am forced to go back to something which I repeated many times as the Minister of State with responsibility for children, that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration.  That must be our attitude in relation to these matters and we should follow that through.  Why should children of travellers be treated differently from other children when it comes to the conditions in which they live?  Why is there the attitude that these are the children of travellers and travellers choose to live in this manner?  Some of them are forced to live this way but some of them choose to live in this manner.  The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration and we should bear that in mind all of the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> I welcome the commitment in this Bill to improve the conditions in which the travellers live.  That is a priority as far as health is concerned. We all, and particularly the members of local authorities, have a responsibility in this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the consultation with the travellers, but I wonder why there is no reference to consultation with local residents.  I can see circumstances where it might be difficult to have meaningful consultation with some local residents because of their attitudes, but there are other local residents who have a different attitude and wish to be helpful.  I fear that for some the lack of consultation will be an excuse for a negative attitude.  Indeed, it may be a justification for being negative.  I ask the Minister to have another look at this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new measures proposed in sections 31 to 34 relating to unauthorised encampments and anti-social behaviour on sites. There must be legislation to cover a situation where such encampments are a threat to the residents living in them and to other people living close to them on health, safety and environmental grounds.  The public authorities must have the power to deal with these threats.</P>
    <P>In that context, I regret the attitude of one traveller support group in particular &mdash; I am not sure whether this is the traveller support group to which Deputy Hayes referred &mdash; which made representations to me and sought the deletion of section 31.  This is an irresponsible and ostrich like attitude because to delete section 31 is to say that there is no problem here.  It is an attempt to ignore the problem and one will never solve a problem by ignoring the reality.  I am surprised that these people have made representations along these lines.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the proposal that no unauthorised encampments will be allowed within a mile of an official halting site.  This proposal was made by the Task Force on the Travelling Community for the protection of travellers who have been allocated proper accommodation as well as the protection of the residents in the vicinity.  As I understand section 31, there is no obligation to provide alternative accommodation for those who have encamped within a one mile radius of a proper legal site.  They must be removed if necessary to a spot outside the one mile radius.  This represents such a departure from previous legislation and recent court decisions that I must press the Minister on this matter.  Is he sure of his legal position?  Deputy Hayes referred to the number of court cases and the amount of public money which has been spent on them.  What is the advice of the Attorney General in this matter &mdash; I assume the Attorney General has been consulted?  Is the Minister sure a coach and four will not be driven through these provisions?</P>
    <P>Assurances have been given to local residents in the past which have proved to be worthless.  A <Col N="1020" /> letter to an association in my area, the Ballyowen Residents' Association, at a time when a halting site was being located there states that as previously confirmed to the association, the council, which is now South Dublin County Council, guarantees that Ballyowen Lane will be kept free of unauthorised caravans once the site has been opened and that any unauthorised caravans arriving in the lane will be removed within 48 hours. Those assurances have proved not to be worth the paper on which they were written.  I want an assurance from the Minister that the circumstances, which I could outline, at Ballyowen Lane will not happen again.  I want to be absolutely sure that the Minister has the right legal advice in relation to this matter and that these provisions will be implemented.  If we pass this Bill &mdash; there is no reason we will not do so because it will have the support of Fine Gael &mdash; when will this part of the Bill be brought into force?  I want the total, unequivocal assurance and commitment of the Minister that encampments of this nature will not be allowed in future within a mile radius of a halting site.  I ask for that assurance not only in the interests of people who live close to these halting sites but of the inhabitants of the halting sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which the Labour Party will not oppose on Second Stage.  As the Minister of State said, the Bill sets out to implement the national strategy for traveller accommodation which was adopted by the previous Government, of which I had the honour of being a member.  The accommodation strategy was an integral part of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community which presented its report to the previous Government in July 1995.  This task force was established by my friend and colleague, former Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  Since his name has not been mentioned in the House this morning, I want to pay tribute to Mervyn for the wonderful work he did not only in relation to addressing the needs of the travelling community but of so many other minority groups.  The establishment of a Department of Equality and Law Reform and giving the stewardship of that Department at its inception to a person of the calibre of Mervyn Taylor was one of the most important decisions of Government in recent times.  The task force report represents a blueprint for great change across a range of Departments in respect of one of the most serious social issues we must address, namely, how to assimilate, accommodate, recognise the diversity of and provide for the needs of the travelling community.  I salute Mr. Mervyn Taylor for establishing the task force and steering its work and for making great progress in the area of equality and law reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, who chaired the task force until her appointment to ministerial office.  That represented a unique continuum because she moved from being chair of the task force to being <Col N="1021" /> Minister of State with responsibility for housing, which allowed her to bring forward the key proposals on accommodation.  I had the privilege to bring the final proposals for legislation to Government.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute also to former Senator Mary Kelly who, following Deputy McManus' elevation, took up the reins and chaired the latter stages of the task force's work with great effect.</P>
    <P>The task force report maps out a blueprint for action in a range of areas.  It spells out requirements in respect of accommodation, the specific issue addressed in the legislation before the House, in stark terms.  Table D2 &mdash; Estimate of Accommodation Units required 1995 to 2000 &mdash; shows that 3,100 units of accommodation will be needed by the turn of the millennium.  The figures provided show that, in 1995, 1,125 households were living on the roadside, 325 were living on temporary sites and, under the heading &ldquo;General increase&rdquo;, 650 were either housed or living on permanent sites.  The table also includes information pertaining to transient groups and indicates that a total of 3,100 families required accommodation in 1995.  One of the problems the Government will face is the provision of such accommodation.</P>
    <P>Governments have always held the view that resources would be made available where councils were willing to provide for the needs of travellers. However, the task force report indicates that extensive resources will be required to provide the units of accommodation to which I referred.  For example, paragraph 2.2.4 states that the estimated cost of meeting the accommodation needs of the travelling community up to the year 2000 is £218 million in 1994 prices.  Taking inflation into account that figure has probably risen to £250 million, which is a sizeable sum. Table D6 of the report provides a breakdown of the individual components of the £218 million.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about implementing the provisions of the Bill and addressing the comprehensive accommodation needs of travellers between now and the year 2000 in a realistic way, expenditure of the order recommended by the task force must be provided.  I am seeking an assurance from the Minister of State that this money will be provided and that we are not engaged in an academic exercise of merely highlighting the framework of need, stating how we intend to deal with it and hoping that resources will be provided in the timeframe outlined.  Having served as Minister for the Environment, I realise that that scale of funding represents a considerable investment and I am aware that other pressures and demands will be placed on the Minister of State.  However, I hope the publication and probable enactment of the Bill represents a clear and firm signal of the will of the Government &mdash; echoed by the will of the Dáil &mdash; that this expenditure should be made available.  I remind Members that, at the outset of this process, I introduced a substantial increase in the capital provision for traveller accommodation <Col N="1022" /> from an outturn of £6.5 million in 1996 to £11 million in the original Estimate for 1997.</P>
    <P>The details of the strategy include a number of key proposals such as the establishment of a traveller accommodation unit within the Department of the Environment and Local Government to oversee the strategic plan and national policy, the establishment of a traveller accommodation consultative group, which is vital to ensure that all partners in this endeavour can feel they are part of the process, and a range of legislative changes outlined by the Minister of State, the most important of which is the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State indicated, despite the focus of recent times and the expenditure of a considerable sum of money, the number of travellers on the roadside has not been significantly reduced in the past five years.  It was estimated five years ago that 1,180 families were living on the roadside.  At the end of last year, despite the provision of accommodation for 849 traveller families in the past five years, 1,127 were estimated to be living on the roadside.  Why is that? If that volume of accommodation is being provided, why is the net figure of travellers living on the roadside not being reduced?  One of the reasons for this is the increase in the number of British based Irish travellers returning home.  We must take account of that in framing plans to meet future needs.</P>
    <P>A key element of the strategy is the requirement for local authorities to consult travellers in the preparation and adoption of the five year programmes to meet not only the existing need but also the projected need of their functional areas. Other speakers referred to the uneven performance of local authorities to date, a matter upon which we must reflect.  The issue of meeting traveller accommodation needs cannot be left to those who are willing to grasp the nettle in their functional areas.  Other local authorities are prepared to let them do this while taking no such initiative themselves.  If we are to provide for the accommodation needs of travellers to a standard that is acceptable in modern Ireland, it is clear that local authorities must act in concert.</P>
    <P>One of the great problems in the past was that those who considered it right to provide for traveller families resident in their areas believed they were merely attracting additional families because adjoining local authorities were taking no such action, which compounded the difficulties involved.  There seemed to be a penalty on those who acted responsibly.  There must be a clear national programme run by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  We know from our respective roles as legislators and as local authority members that, if we want to find one, there is always a good reason not to propose a halting site, a transient site or proper housing.  Some local authorities have debated this issue for years while others which want to take an initiative feel undermined by that reluctance and attitude.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1023" /> The Department of the Environment and Local Government will have the legal framework to ensure a comprehensive plan is established. There must be no laggards in that regard and it will be up to the Minister to ensure it is put in place.</P>
    <P>With regard to the local consultative committees to be established under the Bill, it is important that tradition is respected.  We all know there are areas where traveller families will not live for cultural reasons, which must be respected. Similarly, there are traditional areas where they have stopped for generations.  This must also be respected.  There must be a clear input of local knowledge and local traveller culture and the inclusion of this local consultative process is a critical element of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the vindication of citizenship. There will be no citizenship for those not entitled to the rights every other citizen enjoys. That includes not only proper accommodation but also the right to expect the same health status as the average citizen, the same educational opportunities and access to places of entertainment and socialisation.  These do not exist now.  It is a crucial issue for us to resolve in the latter part of this millennium.</P>
    <P>It must be a job for the centre and for the Minister ultimately to ensure the sum of all the individual plans meets the total need.  It would be a ludicrous farce if they did not.  Every local authority must play its part in taking its full obligations on board.  If there are gaps it is for the Minister to intervene.  He will have the power under this provision to tell local authorities, county councils and urban authorities they are not meeting the perceived need in their functional areas and they must do better.</P>
    <P>Issues were brought to my attention from the raft of submissions which we all received, especially from travellers and traveller representative groups.  I welcome the process of submission by interested parties to legislation.  Like every Member of the House I read them with care and interest.  Legislation should progress with inputs from all affected parties.  I wish to bring a few of the concerns expressed to me to the attention of the Minister before dealing with them in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The issue of travellers as a distinct ethnic group with their own culture is very important.  Many submissions wanted that properly recognised in the Bill by having the word &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; designated with a capital letter.  The report of the task force on the travelling community has an interesting chapter devoted to the unique culture and language of the travelling community in Ireland.  It deals with the existence of the language, even among Irish-American travellers who emigrated to America more than a century ago. They have more in common with travellers here than with the Irish-American community in the main.  On page 76 of the report the task force recommends: &ldquo;That the distinct culture and identify <Col N="1024" /> of the Traveller community be recognised and taken into account.&rdquo; I ask the Minister to implement this recommendation by replacing &ldquo;traveller&rdquo; with &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; in the Bill and to determine that there is a unique culture that must be respected and reflected in legislation.</P>
    <P>I listened to the comments of Deputy Currie, whose views I respect.  He touched on a very difficult issue for us.  When we deal with cultural diversity does that mean we need to accept norms of behaviour that would not be acceptable in a different culture, such as our own?  That is very hard to address when dealing, for example, with the treatment of children and women.  While I have no great experience of especially bad treatment of women and children by travellers, there are exceptions.  For example, the notion of travellers putting children on the side of the road to beg is worrying and difficult for us all.  It should not be accepted as a cultural issue.  The rights of children transcend those kinds of issues.  They have a right to be protected.</P>
    <P>Equally, the health status of travellers, touched on by Deputy Currie, is profoundly worrying.  As Minister for Health in 1994 I published the national health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future.  All our analyses on the health profiles of the population as a whole showed travellers to have the worst health status by a huge margin. That is reflected in the task force report on the travelling community.  In section E, page 135, paragraph 2.3, it outlines vital statistics of travelling people.  In 1987 the general fertility rate for travellers was 164.2 per thousand compared with 70.1 per thousand for the settled community.  The infant mortality rate for travellers in 1987 was 18.1 per 1,000 live births compared to the national figure of 7.4. This is more than twice the infant mortality rate of the norm and is closer to a third world than a developed world rate.  The report found that male travellers have over twice the risk of dying in a given year than settled males, a profoundly disturbing statistic, whereas traveller women have a threefold greater risk of dying than the average woman in Ireland in any given year. Finally, travellers are only now reaching the life expectancy that settled Irish people achieved in the 1940s.  These are horrendous facts which we as a society have a responsibility to address.  A critical component in addressing and resolving health difficulties is proper accommodation and sanitation.  That is what this Bill is primarily about.</P>
    <P>The travelling community is anxious to seek clarity in the content of the accommodation programme which should specify the implementation arrangements proposed by local authorities.  The programme should be an itemised, detailed one which would set out the number of specific sites for long &mdash; term living, transient travellers and group housing schemes.  It should also state what assistance will be made available to facilitate those buying houses for home ownership and the quantity of standard local authority houses that <Col N="1025" /> will be provided for travellers.  Those matters should be spelt out in detail in the individual reports rather than there being a general aspiration to provide for X number of travellers in a global sense.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to strengthen the role of the national consultative committee to include the right to advise the Minister to use his powers under section 18(2) which requires a local authority to amend or replace an inadequate or unsuitable accommodation programme.  It is important that the national consultative committee should have real clout to advise the Minister that where there is an acute problem he should take action under section 18(2) to advise and instruct a local authority to replace an inadequate programme with a proper one.</P>
    <P>The traveller movement has requested that the balance of membership of the local consultative committees should be changed to ensure that travellers or traveller representatives make up one third rather than one quarter of the members.  That is a reasonable request and I will table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  I invite the Minister to reflect on that.</P>
    <P>Concern was also expressed at the length of time some travellers have been on sites with socalled limited facilities.  Some such temporary and, by definition, inadequate facilities have accommodated travellers for up to 18 years.  We should deal specifically with that matter in this legislation to ensure it will not be an ongoing issue.  The traveller movement reasonably believes there should be a statutory limit on the number of families to be accommodated on each site that has limited facilities.  I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with those two issues.</P>
    <P>Under section 28 the definition of sites with limited facilities is extraordinarily basic.  Sites with limited facilities means just that.  The definition states that sites with limited facilities means sites which, having regard to the temporary nature of such sites or the short duration of periods of use &mdash; which can be up to 18 years &mdash; have sufficient water, facilities for solid and liquid waste disposal and hard surface parking for caravans. They are hardly an extensive range of facilities that any one of us or our families would like to endure for very long.  Perhaps the Minister would reconsider that definition because it is too limited and too basic.</P>
    <P>All the submissions I received from the traveller movement expressed grave concern at the implications of section 31.  I support that section because it is an important part of the Bill, but we need some explanation of it.  I am happy to respond to the representations I received.  That section could benefit travellers because it would ensure the easier establishment of halting sites when there is a clear provision to ensure that there would not be unauthorised encampment around or near them.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the view of the Minister of State that he would like the voluntary housing <Col N="1026" /> sector to have a greater role in the provision of accommodation for travellers.  The voluntary sector is extremely important and it probably could play an even greater role than the local authorities because it could do things they cannot do in this regard.  I encourage the Minister to develop that good idea.</P>
    <P>The proper management of sites is critical.  In recent times we have had experience of estate management and we brought about some improvements, particularly in estate management in the voluntary housing sector.  A scheme was introduced to provide financial assistance for the management of halting sites, but it is a very small step and we have a long way to go.  Well managed halting sites will sell themselves.  This is an issue on which the Minister must be very proactive in addressing.  I underscore that as a critical component of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to go through the Bill line by line in the select committee.  I welcome this extremely important legislation and I hope that the necessary resources will be put in place to ensure it will comprehensively address in the next few years an issue that has been a social disgrace for generations.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Having been a member of a local authority for 18 years, I am delighted that at long last there are firm proposals on traveller accommodation.  I pay tribute to all involved, particularly the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, the former Minister of State, Deputy McManus during her period as chairperson of the task force and the Ministers of State, Deputies Molloy and Dan Wallace.  Many local authorities took an interest in the issue of traveller accommodation but, unfortunately, others did not.  Having read the proposals in the Bill, the Minister's solid commitment under section 14, which deals with county and city managers having the authority to adopt an accommodation plan within a specific time, is very evident.  I sincerely welcome that commitment in the Bill to address this issue because for many years local authorities have put the matter aside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The instrument in the Bill dealing with the difficulty of providing accommodation for the travelling community will ensure that problem will be resolved.  Unfortunately, travellers have been discriminated against over the years, usually because of the misdeeds of quite a few individuals.  Those who were lucky enough to get permanent accommodation and some formal education were able to settle alongside their settled neighbours, but the sad reality is that 1,200 families still live along the roadside.  Unlike the position some years ago, many traveller families have a desire to seek some sort of permanent accommodation, be it on a halting site, a permanent house or some other <Col N="1027" /> form of housing.  I received a letter this morning from a traveller in my constituency who is 80 years of age.  She points out that she made five or six attempts in the past 30 years to find accommodation. This underlines the difficulty with regard to the accommodation of the travelling community. The difficulties of the lady in this case will be resolved over the next few weeks with a housing scheme in my constituency.  There are many traveller families who desire permanent accommodation but in many local authorities, this solution did not find favour most of the time with the elected public representatives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the task force's recommendation for legislation to put housing for travellers on a firm footing.  The Bill will allow housing authorities to tackle the problem in a planned and comprehensive way.  The approval of local authorities has varied over the years and that is why there are 1,200 families living on the roadside.  Some local authorities have shown great interest but others have not.  My local authority, Laois County Council, has been active on this issue.  I pay tribute to Ms Fionnuala Daly who recognised the need to resolve this issue and the county council is working to resolve it.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings into line those local authorities which have fallen short of playing a full part in resolving the national scandal of roadside encampments often without basic sanitation facilities.  The problem will be tackled successfully because every local authority will have to address the same issues in the same timeframe.  A five year plan will be set out and if progress is not made it will be possible to take action to ensure the deadlines are met.</P>
    <P>I welcome the arrangement whereby county and city managers will be able to adopt the housing programme.  While it was suggested that such an arrangement would be undemocratic, the history of the traveller issue shows the need for firm action.  I support the firm action provided for in the Bill.  In the past I have criticised arrangements that give county managers authoritarian powers. However, in this case I welcome it.  In the past local authorities have often failed to address the housing needs within their areas and this has led to frustration for the travelling and the settled communities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions which require local authorities, in consultation with traveller groups, to prepare and adopt by a specified date a five year programme to meet existing and, more importantly, the projected accommodation needs of travellers.  It is important that we cater for the projected needs.  I also welcome the requirement for a periodic statutory assessment of housing and halting sites to be carried out.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for including the transient halting sites option to facilitate the nomadic lifestyle of travellers.  This matter has often caused difficulties for local authorities because they developed their housing stock but did not cater for the needs of transient travellers.  The <Col N="1028" /> new requirements will also serve to assess the need to accommodate the future growth in traveller families in respect of a period to be defined.</P>
    <P>It is important for us to reassure the settled community and to include representatives of the settled community in the working groups.  While the Bill recognises the need to consult at all times with all interests concerned with traveller accommodation, it is important that we amend the legislation to include specifically consultation with the settled community.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 8 that prior notice of the preparation of an accommodation plan must be given.  This measure will help the public to realise that it is part of the process. Another important element is that the housing authority must put the draft programme on public display.  In the past residents of housing estates felt they had been short-changed, so to speak, because such programmes were not made available to them.  The ending of the exemption of halting sites from the normal planning process under Local Government regulations is also welcome.</P>
    <P>It is important for the settled community that the measures will be based on partnership between the local authorities, travellers and, I hope, residents' associations.  If we provide housing, halting sites, group housing and transient halting sites in every local authority area over the next five years there will be no excuse for illegal encampments.  Unauthorised encampments cannot be tolerated, particularly when they exist close to existing traveller accommodation.  I do not agree with the one mile radius provided for in the Bill because it will extend the problem to the outskirts of towns.  It will prove problematic and I ask the Minister to review it.  If we seek to provide accommodation with the full support of the settled community we must assure it that we are taking its fears into account.  No unauthorised encampments should be allowed within five miles of an authorised site.</P>
    <P>Where a local authority fulfils its obligations with regard to traveller accommodation and the families in the estate ignore the accommodation provided the Bill should provide for a sanction. For example, if a family has been offered housing or halting site accommodation but persists in living on the roadside, there must be provision for action by the local authority.  The Bill proposes new powers to deal with illegal parking, particularly adjacent to sites and group housing.  This is a welcome development because it is one of the settled community's greatest fears.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill does not address the difficult issue of the large number of travelling traders who have the resources to look after themselves. We must distinguish the needs of travelling traders from those of other traveller families.  Travelling traders generally travel in large groups and often leave large amounts of refuse and great ill feeling in their wake.  They cause great distress among local people as members of local authorities will confirm.  We should address this matter <Col N="1029" /> in the Bill with effective sanctions, such as the seizure of vehicles.  This may sound draconian but we must establish our commitment to genuine traveller families and separate them in the public mind from the travelling traders.</P>
    <P>The new provisions will deal with the illegal parking of caravans but the method used must be immediate and effective.  There have been problems in the past with having to go to court and the process taking two or three months while ill feeling festers.  The public and the travellers on sites want immediate action, that is, within 24 to 48 hours.  The sanctions must be seen to be effective. Fines are not effective but the confiscation of vehicles would be.</P>
    <P>The extension of the provisions of the Housing Act, 1997, with regard to the control of anti-social behaviour on halting sites provided by local authorities or voluntary groups with the assistance of local authorities is very welcome.  However, the sanctions involved should be effective and other local authorities should not be obliged to accommodate excluded families.  Provision must be made to deal with those who, having been evicted from one area, move to another area.  The Bill will enable local traveller accommodation committees to advise on the management of halting sites.  It should make specific mention of the responsibility of travellers in the upkeep and maintenance of houses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The statistics related to travellers speak volumes and underline my support for traveller accommodation.  Those statistics indicate that 2 per cent of travellers live to the age of 65; the traveller infant mortality rate is three times the national average and the traveller stillbirth rate is twice the national average.  Those are the main reasons I support this legislation.  I always believed travellers were entitled to the same as myself or anybody else under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge Deputy Currie's point that traveller children should not be looked upon differently from those of the settled community.  In the current economic climate we should be prepared to look after those unable to look after themselves. While there has been tremendous criticism over the years from the settled community, it must recognise our job as legislators and public representatives to cater for the needs of genuine people, an example of whom I referred to earlier, waiting 30 years for housing accommodation.  In this family, the husband lives on the side of the road and has a walking aid having suffered a stroke.  The time has come for us to establish our credentials and fully support the Bill.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government <Col N="1030" /> embodied a commitment to give travellers a new deal, which is in line with the national strategy for traveller accommodation.  The thinking behind the Bill was inspired by the harsh living conditions of most travellers, the growth of unofficial roadside encampments and the lack of implementation of a traveller programme by some local authorities.  The Minister placed a strong emphasis on consultation with travellers throughout the Bill and I agree fully as it is the key to its successful implementation.  There must be total openness and the consultation must involve full participation by all interested parties.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will be asked to appoint a consultative committee consisting of members and officials of the appointing authority and, indeed, representatives of the travellers and traveller bodies.  There was no mention of local community representation and this is a serious omission which has been referred to already.  It is imperative that representatives of local communities should be on such bodies.  I wish this to be included in the Bill.  It is vital that local residents have a voice, particularly those in the vicinity of existing and proposed traveller housing accommodation or halting sites.  Local goodwill and understanding cannot be generated in a vacuum and locals must have a voice.  It would be convenient to say council members of the appointing authority are their spokespersons.  I mean no disrespect, but I disagree.  There must be a presence for those who live near official halting sites.</P>
      <P>It would be better to have community views solicited and aired prior to decisions being made. Suggestions and reservations could be expressed at a stage where discussion could lead to agreed solutions.  Agreements reached without the involvement and support of all parties, including local authorities, could prove to be totally meaningless and ineffective.  Anyone who has travelled around the country has seen the many caravans and tents pitched on roadside sites by travellers and the deplorable conditions in which some live. The very existence of those sites poses serious social and health problems and this matter must be addressed.</P>
      <P>On the other hand we have seen an obvious display of wealth and property by certain travellers and traders.  This contrast poses serious credibility problems among many of the settled community, especially those who have been in urgent need of housing for many years.  They also feel they are short-changed by the system and it is obvious to all involved in local bodies that the solution to the problem will not be easy.  There can only be one solution when the issue is addressed openly and honestly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the universal opposition to the housing of travellers by local residents in the areas where they are to be settled.  There is ill-feeling between settled communities and travellers. Much of this attitude can be put down to traditional ingrained beliefs on both sides which have been held sacred through many generations. Many settled people see the settling of travellers <Col N="1031" /> near them as detrimental to themselves, their families and property values.  Many travellers feel they should be housed in adequate accommodation and they are correct.  Unfortunately, some also have the view that they do not share the respect, the values or standards of their settled neighbours and that is not on.</P>
    <P>All local authorities must accept there is an onus on them to accommodate travelling families. Unfortunately, some proceed with the implementation of their responsibilities in a hamfisted manner and this effectively raises the heckles of traveller and settled communities.  Unless honest, open and participative involvement of all bodies is effected under the Bill, it will not work.  It would be easy for all of us to say we support the Bill and not express reservations for fear of offence to some.  We would not do a service to those who will benefit from the Bill if we did not identify and eliminate pitfalls.  We must face our responsibilities.  We cannot succeed if we view the major task ahead through rose coloured spectacles. When areas are short-listed for development for traveller accommodation, the intentions of the local authorities should be made clear from the start.  This will effectively negate the common belief that all such plans are agreed and arrived at in a manner which will keep the general public in the dark.</P>
    <P>I have been on a travellers sub-committee for the past seven years.  I wish to refer to the record of Cork Corporation in terms of the housing of travellers, which is excellent and commendable. A total of 120 families have been housed in the past five years.  There is a travellers sub-committee of the housing committee of which the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, was a member in 1991 and prior to that.  There are representatives from the traveller and settled communities on the committee.  It has worked well and there has been good consultation.  There are four halting sites in Cork, three on the north side of the city in my constituency and one in Deputy Clune's constituency in Mahon.  We are currently in consultation with travellers &mdash; I visited the Spring Lane halting site last week &mdash; to draw up new plans for an improved halting site based on designs sent to us by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Halting sites need to be improved and be taken out of the black holes of Calcutta where they have been for so long, in far away areas where members of the settled community would not have to pass them.  Accommodation should be brought up the standards expected in the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy.  Travellers must realise their aspirations will only succeed if they are willing accept the responsibilities <Col N="1032" /> imposed on them when the Bill becomes law. They must also recognise others have rights and are equally entitled to protection under the law. Settled communities are entitled to enjoy the benefits of laws enacted to protect them and to guarantee them the right to live in peace in their homes.  Both groups must have honest and open discussion with each other.  Each must learn to understand the other's viewpoint and I foresee a totally negative reaction from the communities which will be their new neighbours in settled accommodation if they and the travellers do not make an effort to establish positive relations.</P>
      <P>We must address reality if this Bill is to succeed in its aims.  Both communities have a perception of their rights and must establish an agreed mechanism which will enable them to express their ideas and perceptions.  They must bear in mind the fact that every right conferred on them by the State carries the corresponding responsibility.  I thank the Minister for his obvious determination to ensure the Bill succeeds in its aims.  He has put much time and effort into its presentation. Section 31 states &ldquo;the local authority may serve&rdquo; and I hope the Minister tables an amendment which states that the local authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; serve. I cannot see the section which relates to enforcement working unless that is the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill.  Since last September I have frequently asked on the Order of Business for its publication and I am disappointed that, even though much of the preparatory work was done by the previous Government, it has taken so long for it to be brought before the Oireachtas.  I join the tributes to the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, for establishing the task force, to my colleague, Deputy McManus, who initially chaired the task force and did much of the preparatory work for the legislation, and to the former Senator, Ms Mary Kelly, who subsequently chaired the task force.  It has been accepted by all sides that its report represents a blueprint, not only for the provision of accommodation for travellers, but for dealing with their many interrelated needs in health, education, promotion of their culture and the provision of income and accommodation.</P>
      <P>This issue should not be so difficult.  The Minister said that housing or halting site accommodation has not been provided for about 1,000 traveller families who are living on the side of the road.  In a country which prides itself on being an economic success and one of the most prosperous nations in the world, it is not acceptable that some of our citizens continue to live in shanty villages and encampments, and this is a mark of our failure as a society to provide decent accommodation for them.  I hope and expect that this Bill will provide the framework for the provision of adequate traveller accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before discussing the detail of the Bill I will comment on the plight of travellers.  The task force report has provided a blueprint for the <Col N="1033" /> improvement of conditions of living for travellers, and for their rights.  I hope all Government Departments and agencies and those to whom the report's recommendations are addressed will implement them without delay.</P>
    <P>One must question the way travellers are normally considered, not only by those who are prejudiced against them but also by many of their supporters.  Why, when speaking of travellers' rights, do we speak only in general or generic terms?  Why do we talk of them as if they were a homogenous tribe, rather than as individual citizens with rights?  It is interesting that the task force report, the consultative committee and the Minister, in supplying figures today, refer only to the number of traveller families or households &mdash; I have seen no information as to how many travellers we are talking about.  Why can we not speak of travellers as men, women and children, the same way we speak about every other subset in our society?</P>
    <P>I make this point because, if we continue to count travellers not as individuals but as families or households, to refer to them solely in terms of being a disadvantaged minority or an ethnic group &mdash; and I understand the reason many supporters of the travelling community use that description &mdash; we disguise their individual rights and needs.  It is time we began to think of the needs of travellers in all areas, including accommodation, in terms of individual needs.  The use of generic descriptions of travellers, and the generalisation of their condition and circumstances, invites the type of prejudice we do not want to see.  If those who support travellers and advocate their rights do not ascribe to them their rightful, individual identities, is it any wonder those who are prejudiced against them will ascribe to all travellers the misdeeds of the few?  The use of generic terms to describe travellers makes integration difficult &mdash; Deputy Currie made a number of interesting comments on that point.  It also undermines the self-respect, dignity and sense of individual responsibility which each person should have.  It ultimately encourages a culture of dependence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes spoke of the relationship which existed at another time between the traveller and settled communities.  When such a relationship did exist it had a strong economic dimension &mdash; for example, the skills and crafts pursued by travellers and the trade in horses were part of the interface between individual travellers and members of the settled community, when ours was a more rural society.  It is time we approached the question of travellers not with the patronage and pity which have so often characterised the discussion, but with the encouragement of the sense of pride which travellers have and should have.</P>
    <P>The use of generic terms also disguises the individual differences between travellers, which also exist in all sections of society.  It sometimes absolves the sense of individual responsibility. We must think in terms of the individual and individual rights, and if we do we will arrive much <Col N="1034" /> more quickly to the conclusion that people have certain rights which transcend their cultural background or identity.  No child should have to exist in a caravan or tent parked in a dyke on the side of the road, and any child who has to live in such conditions is inevitably exposed to ill-health and early mortality, as mentioned and statistically shown in the various reports before us.  No woman should be expected to rear and provide for her children, and do all the normal household tasks such as providing clothing and preparing meals, often on her own, in the isolated, inadequate and unsanitary conditions in which travellers exist.  I do not wish to be seen as generalising in making the following point because I am speaking about individual cases &mdash; no father should drink his dole money and expect his wife and family to beg for the basic necessities of life. In discussing the condition of travellers, we must assert individual rights and responsibilities, just as we do for all other sectors of our society.</P>
    <P>The difficulty we must face up to collectively is the failure of society to provide accommodation for travellers.  In addressing the question of accommodation, we must first acknowledge that three quarters of travellers are already settled in local authority housing.  There are 1,817 families in standard housing, 324 in group housing, 102 in private housing, 17 are housed by the voluntary sector and 1,134 are housed on halting sites.  This Bill is addressed at the quarter of the travelling community who are not provided with accommodation.</P>
    <P>Our failure to provide accommodation for travellers is highlighted in the most recent report of the consultative committee.  It is appalling that while about 1,000 traveller families have not been provided with accommodation, only 63 halting site bays were completed in 1997 and only 32 were under construction at the end of 1997.  Of the 41 local authorities which have responsibility for this area, only four were in the process of constructing permanent halting sites at the end of 1997.  That is an appalling indictment of the performance of local authorities in the provision of accommodation for travellers.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires local authorities to draw up a five year plan, which I welcome.  I also welcome the public consultation process provided for. However, I strongly recommend that the public consultation process should be a proactive one, with communities invited to identify possible sites in their areas where travellers might be accommodated. In that context, section 31 will be of considerable assistance in explaining to local communities that the provision of a halting site or group housing scheme will not result in subsequent unauthorised encampments.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provision that in cases where the local authority fails to adopt a plan the county manager will have the final say. I understand this applies only to circumstances where the authority fails to adopt any plan. However, there should be an appeals mechanism <Col N="1035" /> against the decision of the county manager in the interests of fairness and workability.</P>
    <P>I assume the reason for giving the final decision to the county manager is to ensure that a plan will ultimately be adopted and that the local authority will provide accommodation for travellers. However, I fear this provision will lead to local authorities ending up in the courts facing judicial reviews.  Deputy Hayes already spoke about the appalling waste of public money in pursuing these issues through the courts.  I remind the House that it is not only travellers who have taken court cases &mdash; many well heeled settled communities have also taken cases to court.  If this provision remains without an appeals mechanism it will ultimately lead back to the courts and the Bill's objective, which is to provide traveller accommodation in a more urgent manner, may be slowed down.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify that section 31 also refers to the provision of group housing?  It is remarkable that group housing has not been given a higher profile in the Bill.  It should have been.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the absence of provisions for the implementation of the plan.  The Bill provides for the adoption of the plan but it is less than clear on what will happen if the plan is not implemented.  The plan must ultimately be implemented because the county manager has the final say in that.  However, what will happen if a local authority adopts a five year plan but does not implement it?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Howlin's comments on the composition of the consultative committee.  There is a need for consultation at a much lower level than is provided for.  It is fine to have consultative committees where representatives of the travelling community and the settled community, local authorities, State agencies and Departments meet and discuss these matters.  However, there is also a need for dialogue where the sites and group housing schemes are to be located.  Some provision should be made for that in the arrangements which are made when sites or group housing are allocated.  The provision of sites and group housing carries a corresponding responsibility in regard to maintenance and good management. There must be dialogue at a much more local level in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the management of sites and group housing schemes after they are established, some local authorities have been less than adequate in this regard.  The legislation should provide a mechanism whereby the Minister can give directions to local authorities on the management of estates, group housing schemes and sites.</P>
    <P>There is a need to professionalise the service in the management of sites and group housing schemes at local authority level.  Deputy Moloney referred to an official in his local authority who had an interest in this area and who advanced the programme.  That is replicated in a number of local authorities, where a particularly committed <Col N="1036" /> official will advance the programme.  However, the problem is that very often individuals with such an interest or skill are moved because of promotional opportunities, transfers or reorganisation. An administrative officer dealing with the programme today can be moved to the planning department or the finance department next week.</P>
    <P>In the provision of housing generally, there is a need to develop a core of experienced professional staff within the local authority service who will remain with the housing programme, as is the case in the planning area where there are professional planning officers.  Some of those professional housing officers could specialise in the area of traveller accommodation.  This would provide the necessary continuity, which we are not getting from some local authorities in the management of group housing schemes and halting sites.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on bringing forward this important legislation and keeping faith with the Government programme in regard to services and facilities for members of the travelling community.  I also thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, for the interest he has shown in this issue, not just arising out of this legislation but in recent years.  I have worked with him on a number of occasions on issues concerning the rights and entitlements of the travelling community. This legislation, if properly implemented within the timescale set out in certain sections of the Bill, will make a major contribution to the well-being of the travelling community, enabling them to access other services to which they currently find it difficult to obtain access.  Before proceeding, I would like to share my time with Deputy Tony Killeen.</P>
      <P>I listened to the debate in this House and I have read accounts of the debate in the other House, so I will not go into detail on the accommodation requirements other than to say that we will require about 3,100 units over the next couple of years if we are to meet the needs of the travelling community.  This legislation, if implemented, will result in considerable progress in providing the type of accommodation that is urgently required by the travelling community.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from a number of organisations, including the National Traveller Women's Forum and Dublin Accommodation Coalition with Travellers, which is an umbrella organisation for a number of traveller support groups and other interested organisations.  Those representatives and others have in the main welcomed this Bill.  Although they have suggested some changes, they see this legislation as having the potential to make a significant contribution to the issue of accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The successful implementation of this legislation will very much depend on different organisations and individuals giving it a fair chance. <Col N="1037" /> Among those groups are the local authorities. The management, elected members and officials of local authorities have to realise that on this occasion the objective laid down, to provide accommodation over the next four or five years, will have to be met.  I would like to see that happen sooner, but there will have to be an understanding that there can be no further slippage in the provision of accommodation for travellers. There have been many reports in the past, and annual statistics on accommodation requirements, all telling a sorry tale concerning the provision of accommodation for travellers.  On this occasion we have to remember, once and for all, that if we fail to implement the tenets of this legislation relative to accommodation, society will have failed disgracefully to live up to its responsibility to a significant minority in the community to provide them with basic facilities to which they are entitled.  Travellers themselves agree that unless decent accommodation is provided, they cannot access the other services of the State. These include, most importantly, education.  It is very difficult for traveller children to go to pre-schools, primary schools or second level schools if they do not start from a base of decent accommodation. They feel they stand out when they go to school because they do not come from a background where they have access to the basic facilities associated with accommodation.  It is very difficult to provide health care for travellers, particularly when they are moved, sometimes by force, from one area to another and often intimidated into moving from the areas in which they live.  This is unfortunate and arises because the State has failed to meet the accommodation needs of the travelling community.  Bearing in mind that only about 3,000 units are required to meet current and future needs, it is not a particularly large objective.  For that reason this legislation may make a significant difference.</P>
    <P>This legislation will have to receive the wholehearted support of local authorities and local elected representatives.  I want to introduce a note of caution here.  The local elections loom next June.  I sincerely hope the issue of the provision of traveller accommodation and the drawing up of the plans will not be politicised by those who seek to use the provision of accommodation for travellers to further their own ends.  I am concerned that might happen as we had examples of it in the past.  Deputies have already referred to the role of the courts relative to certain sites.  I sincerely hope, given the consultation process that permeates this legislation, that there will be no further delays or difficulties in providing accommodation.</P>
    <P>Many people's attitude to traveller accommodation has been influenced to some extent by what they see as poorly or inadequately managed existing sites.  There is a case to answer in that regard.  For too long sites with basic facilities have been provided, but the management and maintenance of the sites by the local authorities have left much to be desired, certainly in the case of <Col N="1038" /> older sites.  That has coloured people's opinion of the development of halting sites in their own areas.  It is clear to anyone with an interest in accommodation for travellers that, where the local authority discharges its full responsibilities for managing and maintaining sites, there has been no problem with those sites.  If basic services were withdrawn from householders &mdash; I refer particularly to refuse collection and the provision of sewerage and water facilities &mdash; we would find ourselves in a difficult situation.  We have had examples where refuse was uncollected because of industrial disputes and much of that refuse ended up where it should not be, and that was because householders did not have the service to which they felt entitled.  No one condones their actions.  I am simply drawing a parallel with the management and maintenance of accommodation for travellers.  For too long basic services and facilities have not been provided.  I hope that day is over.  I am very encouraged by a number of sites I have seen in the greater Dublin area and around the country where services are provided on a regular basis.  Such halting sites are a credit to travellers and local authorities.  I hope that in the management of all halting sites and other traveller accommodation the same facilities and resources will be made available.  I hope that on this occasion the community will work with their local authorities, elected representatives and traveller support groups and organisations which now exist in almost every part of the country and are resourced by different Government Departments and agencies.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that consultation does not mean that either side has a veto.</P>
    <P>I regret that those who demand consultation and, in this case, an accommodation, have the view that the process of consultation means that a group can decide not to allow a site in a certain area.  They believe consultation is all about saying &ldquo;no&rdquo;, but I take a different view.  There should be consultation both with the travellers and the settled communities, and that is provided for.  Consultation should be about communities participating in the provision of accommodation for members of the travelling community and working with respective organisations in the area to ensure that accommodation is to the standard any individual or family would require.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the consultation process might be used to delay the provision of accommodation. There have been examples of that throughout the country where perfectly good sites were proposed but, because of intense local opposition, they did not proceed.  Yet if one returned two or three years later to sites which did proceed, despite local opposition, one would find that there were not any problems because the sites were properly maintained by the local authorities.  In such cases, all the concerns of local people were properly met.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  As someone with an interest in the rights of travellers, as do most <Col N="1039" /> people in this House, I want to ensure that accommodation is provided speedily through local authorities.  Because the provision of accommodation and other services for travellers is backed up by legislation, and all the other issues contained therein, we can look back four or five years from now and say we have met our responsibilities.  That is the aim of this legislation and I wish it well.</P>

      <P>Labhair mé ar an ábhar seo i ndíospóireacht anseo breis agus bliain ó shin agus léirigh mé ag an am sin na fadhbanna a bhain, dar liom, leis na moltaí a fuair an Rialtas i mí Iúil 1995.  Ghlac an Rialtas deireannach leis an Stráitéis Náisiúnta um Cóiríocht don Lucht Siúil agus tá an Bille seo bunaithe ar sin.  Rinne an Tasc Forsa obair thábhachtach ach ní raibh grúpa dá gcuid sásta leis an chuntas agus d'fhoilsigh siad moltaí dá gcuid féin. Bhí na moltaí sin bunaithe ar an taithí a bhí acu ar fhadhbanna ina dtaobh féin den tír.</P>
      <P>The history of the provision of traveller accommodation is fraught with difficulties and, at first glance, appears to be an issue that is impossible to address.  The Minister of State indicated that more than 1,000 families were in need of housing at the end of 1996 and that figure had increased by almost 100 over the following year to 15 months.</P>
      <P>The task force report, an excellent document as a result of a great deal of work, illustrated the enormous problems faced by traveller families.  It painted a truly horrific picture of the health of traveller women and their children as against the health of women and children in the settled community, and outlined other health and education matters affecting travellers.  This Bill is an attempt to address those problems but if we underestimate the difficulties that might be encountered it will not deal with them effectively.</P>
      <P>There is a view that local representatives have not been positive towards developments to house and accommodate travellers.  In my experience that has not been the case.  The vast majority of local authority members have been well disposed to dealing with the problems but they frequently had experiences which taught them to be careful when grappling with this issue.  On occasions when they stuck out their necks in support of a solution, they were criticised when it subsequently failed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision for consultation with travellers, the general public and local authorities. It is important that consultation be in the form of genuine dialogue which brings forward speedy recommendations rather than a delaying tactic, as the Minister of State outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that the five year accommodation plan takes account of the views and needs of travellers, but I am concerned that local authorities <Col N="1040" /> will not have the capacity to implement the plans when they are prepared.  Unless this issue is dealt with by a national agency, we will continue to spend a great deal of money while being unable to effectively address this problem.  I am not saying the local authorities should not have a role in the implementation of the plan but they must have the back-up of a national agency, not just a consultative committee.</P>
    <P>The history of the provision by local authorities of group housing and permanent and transient halting sites is generally poor.  Where sites and group housing have been provided, the local authorities frequently have been unable to maintain them to an acceptable standard.  However, the blame does not rest entirely with the local authorities.  There have been occasions in my own county where local authority employees were prevented from doing work on halting sites and group housing schemes.  That is not acceptable and we must face up to that problem.  Every local authority faces the same difficulties and unless a national agency is involved at an administrative level in that part of the programme, we will continue to have failures.</P>
    <P>Local authorities, including Clare County Council, Ennis County Council and others, frequently have been successful in providing local authority housing for travellers.  There is a gradual move towards an acceptance of that policy. Problems that arose in local authority estates were dealt with over a period of time, sometimes successfully.  Where the local authorities have consistently failed is in their dealings with permanent halting sites &mdash; there is not provision for transient ones in County Clare &mdash; and group housing.  Enormous amounts of money have been expended on building and rebuilding sites and group housing schemes, but the failures have continued.</P>
    <P>The number of families and individuals among the travelling community affected by this crisis is so large that we cannot afford to have another four or five year plan which fails to deliver.  We must learn from the mistakes and the failures of the past.  We must provide the level of back-up service for local authorities to allow them succeed. In one group housing scheme on the outskirts of Ennis town, in the Rosslevan area at Gaurus, the houses were rebuilt on three occasions.  The local authority is currently in the process of employing a contractor to flatten the site &mdash; there is not much flattening to be done because the houses are in an advanced stage of dereliction &mdash; for rebuilding purposes.  I find it impossible to believe that the local authority will be in a position to manage the new scheme of four houses which I understand it is intended to build in that location.</P>
    <P>We frequently blame local communities for their opposition to travellers but the local authority in the area to which I refer has been more than accommodating, and that is frequently the case.  We always assume that a community which is in the vicinity of a halting site or a group housing <Col N="1041" /> scheme will raise objections but that is not always the case.  They are often prepared to live beside travellers provided a certain minimum standard is met.  That has been the experience generally in County Clare.  Despite what I said, I remain optimistic that the Bill provides a framework within which the problem may be addressed.  I strongly urge that the role of the National Advisory Committee should be backed up by a permanent secretariat that will help local authorities to co-ordinate the service they provide and ensure it operates successfully.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak on this Bill. Every local authority has a problem with travellers. I listened to Deputy Killeen speak about local authorities and the general public who wish to help travellers.  In my local authority in Westport we proposed to set up a halting site on four occasions, but we were defeated on each occasion by the public.  A lady, a relation of mine who spends much of her time in the church and will not allow anybody to speak against it &mdash; I admire her for that &mdash; was the first person out with a placard to protest against the halting site, despite the fact that it would have been a quarter of a mile away.  People should not pretend this is not an emotive and serious issue.</P>
      <P>There is a halting site in Castlebar which has worked very well, but the problem arises with the people outside the halting site, on the national primary road.  I have no difficulty with housing travellers and erecting halting sites.  I have been a member of a local authority since 1979 and my town has experienced many problems in this area. The local authority built council houses beside a private housing scheme and a travelling family was accommodated in the house nearest to the private houses.  To be fair to that community, while it was not happy with the halting site, it was prepared to work with and assist the travellers in every way possible.  The young couple in the house beside the halting site left the house because they could no longer live there.  When they sought assistance from the local authority they were told to go to the Garda Síochána who in turn sent them back to the local authority.  All the assistance of the State was available for the traveller family, and rightly so, but there was no assistance for the young couple who had to leave their house.</P>

    <P>There are two types of travellers, those born and reared in local towns who are part of society and are known in the locality and travellers who lock up their houses for the summer and move in caravans to other areas.  They move to Westport for Croagh Patrick weekend and take over Bertra beach.  A court injunction is taken out on each occasion those travellers arrive and the taxpayer has to foot the bill.  Those people are not the responsibility of the local authority.  In some cases <Col N="1042" /> they have public housing, new vans, jeeps and caravans.  They create great problems for the community and they give a bad name to genuine travellers who live in towns and who should be supported.</P>
    <P>In my town there was a travelling family with 15 children.  When the woman of the house died the whole community supported the family.  For three days after the funeral, however, the Garda Síochána, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and members of the urban council, including myself and others, tried to stop the family from burning down the house, as is the tradition when a traveller dies.  The neighbours were disturbed because they thought they would be burned out.  The 15 children left the house, in spite of my pleas not to do so, and are now on the side of a national primary road.  The family was settled in the community and the children were attending school and doing their best.  Those people should be encouraged to put an end to such traditions.  I do not know how we can provide in legislation for those circumstances or for the people who have to leave their houses because of travellers who live near them.</P>
    <P>In many cases there is no problem with the travellers involved but rather with the relatives who visit them.  Last Sunday night travellers moved into my town.  There was uproar on the green at 3 o'clock in the morning and people in the housing estate could not get to sleep.  It was difficult to get the Garda to deal with the problem and the local authority will do nothing about it.  I listened to Deputy Gilmore and others speaking about local authorities, but they do not have the resources to deal with these problems.  For the past ten years in local authorities there have been too many chiefs and not enough Indians.  There are architects and engineers but not enough workers to carry out the work that needs to be done.  There will be major difficulties with this Bill.  Responsibility for travellers is being placed on local authorities, but they do not have the manpower or resources to deal with existing problems in housing estates.</P>
    <P>We must look after travellers who are born and reared in our towns.  I saw a proposal &mdash; I hope it is not in the Bill &mdash; that halting sites should be erected in every town for travellers who travel around the country, but I would not support such a proposal.  No State could be expected to support such legislation.  Every local authority has responsibility for travellers living in their areas and they should be supported.  The problem is how to deal with travellers who move around during the summer months in caravans, creating tension among the settled community.</P>
    <P>I am a member of an urban council and a county council and we do our part for travellers. We provide accommodation for them in housing estates because they have the same right to a council house as has anybody else.  Every time a site is identified for a halting site, however, it is in a working class area.  Halting sites are not situated in Dublin 4, Rossbeg or other wealthy areas, <Col N="1043" /> but this is a problem that must be dealt with by all sections of society.  It is fine for do-gooders to say that the problem must be dealt with, but it is unacceptable to leave it to the working class people and those in housing estates.  I made the point at a county council meeting that if halting sites are to be erected in Mayo they should be erected in middle and upper class areas as well as working class areas.  Everybody must play their part in dealing with this serious problem.</P>
    <P>In the past halting sites have always been situated in working class areas where people are unable to fight for themselves.  People in authority are aware that if they target a site in a middle or upper class area, a court injunction will be taken out the following day because people living in those areas have the resources and ability to bring the case to court.  That is unfair. That is why managers should not be given power in this regard.  The local authority should make the decision.  Most county councils are in touch with the people and most councillors want to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>Families who are housed do not generally cause problems.  The difficulties arise when their relatives come to visit and cause rows during the night and so on.  The families who are given council houses are usually from the area and will look after their housing.  What does the Minister of State propose to do about young couples who seek assistance from the Garda or the local authority because of intimidation?  I know two sets of young couples who had to leave their housing because of intimidation.  I hope many of these problems will have been resolved when we discuss this matter again, but I doubt it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill in so far as it is an honest attempt to tackle a persistent social problem which to date has proved resistant to resolution.  In assessing the usefulness of the Bill, we must ask why this problem has been so resistant to resolution and why communities vigorously oppose the location of halting sites in their areas?  Why are an otherwise generous, open and tolerant people, who bore penal taxes to redistribute even a limited national income to other disadvantaged groups, totally opposed to the location of halting sites in their areas?  While Deputy Killeen stated there is not such opposition in County Clare, this is the reality in urban areas where populations are much denser and halting sites are inevitably in close proximity to residential areas.  I suspect, however, this opposition exists throughout the country.  If not, there would be no need for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to take travellers out of their appalling conditions and place them in some type of reasonable accommodation.  The conditions in which travellers live are an affront to all of us.  How will this Bill deal with the problem? What provisions does it contain that will turn a climate of resonant opposition into one of acceptance and even support for the provision of <Col N="1044" /> accommodation for travellers?  The Bill contains very little that will help.  For a variety of reasons, it will fail to achieve what it sets out to do.  I believe proposed halting sites will be subject to the same opposition and complaints from local communities as was the case in respect of all sites up to now.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill are very welcome.  It will make a positive contribution to a settlement policy.  I am pleased it obliges all counties to be part of the solution rather than leaving it up to the same few willing counties that have tried to provide for travellers in the past.  This is a national problem and can be tackled only on a national basis.  The Bill also provides for an exclusion zone to protect against illegal halting in proximity to areas where there is an official halting site.  This is a welcome provision because illegal parking has always been a major bone of contention in areas where there are sites and where sites are opposed.  I have tabled some amendments regarding the extent of the exclusion zone because the word &ldquo;radius&rdquo; has been omitted from the Bill, even though it is included in the Explanatory Memorandum. While the inclusion of that word may not be crucial for areas outside Dublin, it is crucial for the Dublin area.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also attempts to provide for public consultation on the adoption of the accommodation programme but, unfortunately, it goes on to make a mockery of that provision.  For example, if the result of such consultation is public rejection of the programme and the elected members seek to reflect this in their decision making process, the Bill obliges the manager to override that decision and, effectively, proceed as if consultation had not taken place.  I suspect many county managers do not want that power. If it is rammed ahead without democratic participation, it is doomed to failure.  The Minister of State said that as each site progressed it would be subject to part 10 of the local government regulations in terms of public consultation.  This is another con job on the public because when submissions are made it will be up to the manager to adjudicate on his proposal; it will not go back to the elected members.  This effectively makes the public consultation a meaningless process.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the traveller issue that incenses the public is the lack of a democratic decision making process.  Before the last election commitments were made about bringing traveller halting sites into the planning process and making them subject to the same type of control as other projects. If the Government reneges on that commitment, it will pay the price and undermine progress on other aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The main reason I believe the Bill will fail to achieve its objective is that it makes the mistake we have always made when attempting to take travellers off the roadside.  It is a one dimensional Bill and tends to deal only with accommodation needs.  We know from past experience that public <Col N="1045" /> acceptance of an accommodation programme is linked to tackling all the other issues that surround the lives of travellers, such as their employment, health and education needs.  Their accommodation needs cannot be progressed on their own.  We should also address certain aspects of their culture which in many ways is anathema to a civilised society.  I am talking about practices such as allowing children out on the streets to beg when they should be at school.</P>
    <P>The Bill demands the impossible from local authorities.  We cannot expect a housing authority to resolve complex and intractable social problems. This is a national and multi-dimensional problem.  We have only one truly disadvantaged and marginalised group in society who, for the most part, live in conditions that do none of us any credit.  This problem is not beyond our capability to tackle.  As a nation we have the willingness and the prosperity to do so.  It is not beyond us to give travellers a better quality of life from which their children can aspire to enjoy the prosperity of the country.  If we are to achieve this we must have less political correctness and more honesty and realism.  The Bill introduces some of this, but I hope my amendments will be accepted. This is not a one-dimensional problem, it must be tackled on all fronts simultaneously.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>On 4 June last in Vienna I met the Austrian Chancellor, Mr. Viktor Klima, who will become President in office of the European Council on 1 July.  We discussed a wide range of European issues, including the Cardiff European Council and the priorities for the Austrian Presidency of the European Union during the second half of this year.  The Austrian Presidency will have the task of completing the final stages of preparations for the introduction of the euro.  This commenced on 4 June last with the inaugural meeting of the Euro XI group in Luxembourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will fall to the Austrian Presidency to make substantial progress on the Agenda 2000 negotiations. I outlined to Chancellor Klima Ireland's position on the Commission's current proposals on Structural and Cohesion Funds.  I re-emphasised the need for generous transitional arrangements for Ireland under the Structural Funds and <Col N="1047" /> our opposition to the Commission proposals for CAP reform as they currently stand.  It is the Government's intention to pursue real improvements on the terms on offer.</P>
    <P>I met Prime Minister Guterres of Portugal in Lisbon on 9 June last.  I had discussions on the European agenda with the Prime Minister.  In particular, we identified areas of common interest in the Agenda 2000 negotiations, including the need for generous transitional arrangements for those regions which no longer qualify for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>My discussions with Chancellor Klima and Prime Minister Guterres were a continuation of a structured programme of consultations with the leaders of other member states, including Prime Ministers Lipponen, Aznar and Blair, on a range of European Union issues in preparation for Cardiff and the detailed negotiations on Agenda 2000.</P>
    <P>I attended the European Council in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June.  The outcome of the Cardiff summit represents a successful conclusion to the UK's Presidency of the European Union.  Items for discussion at the Council included the Agenda 2000 negotiations, broad economic guidelines for the Union and the national employment action plans, EU enlargement and the future shape of the Union.  Other important issues covered included the progress being made on the Union's policies on drugs and organised crime.  The conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the House.  I intend to make a full statement to the House on the Cardiff summit next Tuesday, 23 June.</P>
    <P>I met the South African President, Mr. Nelson Mandela <i>en marge</i> of the summit and I have placed in the Library a copy of the press release issued after that meeting.</P>
    <P>The term of office of the current European Commission does not expire until the end of 1999 and, as such, this matter will fall for consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>I will attend a ceremony in Frankfurt on 30 June to mark the establishment of the European Central Bank and I will visit China the week beginning 14 September 1998 at the invitation of Chinese Prime Minister, Zhu Ronji.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the discussions on Agenda 2000 which concerns the Union budget, does the Taoiseach agree with the statement by the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, that we can enlarge the European Union to bring in the existing applicant countries and still keep the Union budget within the existing ceiling of 1.27 per cent of GDP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the stated position of Theo Waigel and a number of other countries. However, some countries disagree because they believe that as enlargement proceeds, the 1.27 per cent will not be sufficient.  The current position, with which we agree, is that in the unlikely event <Col N="1048" /> that enlargement will greatly affect the Agenda 2000 period, the 1.27 per cent is a satisfactory basis for discussions.  That is the way it was left at yesterday's meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated, 1.27 per cent is what all countries are saying is sufficient at this stage.  A decision has not been made and nobody is requesting one.  What will finally happen next March under the German Presidency is another matter.  However, 1.27 per cent is on the table for the basis of discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Taoiseach is not able to unambiguously say he regards 1.27 per cent as completely inadequate to deal with the needs of the countries which will become members of the European Union.  I do not regard 1.27 per cent as sufficient and the Government should also state that.  Theo Waigel said that 1.27 per cent would suffice after enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discussion on what happens after enlargement.  What is being discussed is the position now and for this round.  It is the view of the European Council that there will not be enlargement in the Agenda 2000 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>Is it not the case then that the current examination of the dossiers on enlargement, which has not yet been concluded, has been prejudged and that the countries which have applied for enlargement are being told the present process is of no relevance in so far as timing is concerned because that has already been decided?  That appears to be the case from what the Taoiseach said.</P>
      <P>Is it planned that the Austrians will have a special summit on the principle of subsidiarity next October?  Is the Taoiseach aware that some of the big countries, notably Germany and France, are trying to unpick the Amsterdam Treaty, are calling into question a number of EU policies which have long been settled as part of the <i>Acquis Communautaire</i> and, under the guise of subsidiarity, are trying to dismantle existing policy and undermine the authority of the court and the political authority of the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided that there would be a special one day meeting in November during the Austrian Presidency.  This arose from the discussion, among other things, of the letter sent by President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Kohl to the Council at the Avignon meeting.  The subject matters of that letter are fairly well known but clearly there was not great support for following <Col N="1049" /> its contents.  In fairness to the two countries involved neither of them was pursuing it.  I was asked the reason the letter was sent, I will not go into that, but it was not pursued.</P>
      <P>Countries made it absolutely clear that the Amsterdam Treaty has just been ratified in the first few countries; Finland ratified yesterday in the parliament.  Over the next year other countries will ratify.  There was agreement &mdash; if not majority, close to it &mdash; that to start negotiating anything new, in addition to that or matters that were not resolved in Amsterdam would be incorrect. It was also felt that we should look to the process of implementation for Protocol 1 matters agreed at Amsterdam, nobody has any problems with them.  Apart from the letter from the chancellor and the president, the Commission is carrying out a detailed examination of a document entitled &ldquo;Tomorrow's Commission&rdquo; which deals with making the Commission, the Council, more effective by ordinary sensible management structures. Nobody has a difficulty with any of that. The Commission will report on that matter at the meeting in November.  We discussed how we can move on to make the workings of the European Council more effective without any treaty changes.</P>
      <P>The third aspect, the General Affairs Council, which will be discussed in November concerns countries even more than the first two issues.  The General Affairs Council was meant to be the co-ordinating council for all the other councils and to deal with the nuts and bolts or the management work but that is not the case.  I am not totally familiar with all the meetings of the Council but it always deals with foreign and security issues.  While it meets more often it never gets to any of its other work.  There is more concern about that matter than with the other two.  It was considered that another mechanism should be devised.  The suggestion was that there should be a committee of Ministers, at senior level &mdash; not foreign affairs Ministers and not heads of State &mdash; who would make it their business to deal with the ongoing workings and the day to day issues of the Council to push matters forward.  Those three areas will be discussed at the November meeting.</P>

      <P>With all due respect it is not acceptable that the reply to 15 questions, in which he significantly omitted to respond to a number of questions, was delivered by the Taoiseach in four minutes.  I have a number of questions but I do not propose to ask them all together.  I attempted prior to today to raise questions in advance of the Cardiff summit which were ruled out of order.  I am now attempting to get responses to what issues were raised by the Taoiseach.  I sought to ask the Taoiseach in advance of the Council what issues he would raise.  In my question on today's Order Paper I asked him specifically what issues he raised in Cardiff.  He avoided, on political instruction, answering the questions prior to Cardiff. His reply made no reference to the points I <Col N="1050" /> raised in Question No. 11 which asked the Taoiseach the issues he raised at the European summit in Cardiff.  Did he raise anything?</P>

      <P>The European Council is not a question and answer session.  I am aware the Minister may have attended in his ministerial capacity but it is not a question and answer session. In terms of the informal lunchtime issue &mdash; as in ECOFIN of which the Deputy has experience &mdash; of course issues were raised in the normal course.  At the meeting itself I contributed to and raised questions on all the issues I mentioned, the economic guidelines, the national employment action plans, EU enlargement, the future shape of Europe and the 2000 negotiations.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of the questions from the three Opposition leaders were about Austria and Portugal.  I presume the Deputy did not expect me to answer those questions separately.  The Deputy mentioned another question about a matter that does not arise until late next year.  I have no difficulty in answering questions individually but the Deputy would complain about that.  I see nothing wrong with the grouping taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically put down a question to the Taoiseach, in light of the poor turn out in the recent referenda and the historically low support in the vote on the Amsterdam Treaty, asking if the Irish Government would raise two issues that might address the democratic deficit within the European Union operations: the public election or selection of the future president of the Commission and the televising of Council of Ministers meetings.  On political direction, from the Taoiseach's office, those questions were transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is not involved in any decision making process of that kind.  I specifically gave advance notice that it was necessary to raise these issues. It would appear from what the Taoiseach said that none of these matters was raised at the bilateral meetings he had either in Finland, Austria or Portugal or with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. Certainly, those issues do not appear to have been raised by the Taoiseach in the course of the debate.  Does the Taoiseach share my concern that there is a democratic deficit in terms of the perception by the citizen of the proceedings of the European Union, which has been trumpeted by the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair?  Specifically was the question of the election or some process of election of the future president of the Commission raised and discussed, because it is not apparent from his reply?  Was the question of full coverage by the media of all Council meetings raised and discussed in Cardiff? <Col N="1051" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of these issues was on the agenda and neither was discussed either formally or informally in Cardiff, nor were they meant to be.  At this stage there is no proposal with the European Council about the presidency. There has been some talk about a way of dealing with it.  What was discussed &mdash; the turnout for the election here was quite substantial but nevertheless not high enough &mdash; in the debate on Monday was how to make the Community more relevant to the people, how the people can be more involved in the issues.  There were 14 or 15 suggestions on how that could be done but televising the debates is not one of them.  Deputy Quinn will be aware that for some years some Councils, including the Social Affairs Council have been televised.  I was present when the first meeting of that Council was televised many years ago.  I was also present at a number of ECOFIN Council meetings which have been televised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the Taoiseach's view, since that concern was clearly signalled in questions which were declined by his Department and since Prime Minister Blair is trumpeted in the newspapers today about bringing the institutions of the European Union closer to the people, why did he not articulate that view by engaging in some kind of open participatory process in the selection of the next president?  More specifically, having the fourth estate media, both in physical form and in electronic form at every Council meeting, why did he not raise that issue if he believed in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it would not be the highest one on my agenda.  If we want the people of Europe to be more interested we have to deal with their day to day issues and the 18 million unemployed, drugs trafficking and the security issues that concern many people in Europe.  These are the kinds of issues which people want to hear us addressing.  They are the ones which will change people's view, not showing 15 minutes or half an hour of it on television.  As the Deputy will be aware, at the end of every Council the better part of 1,000 journalist are present to bring back the story of the Council.  If the Deputy seriously thinks that is a priority, it worries me. <Col N="1052" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleagues for allowing me a last supplementary on this issue. Would the Taoiseach not agree it is preferable that the media should be present at Council meetings as they are here, looking at the process of how we deal with everyday issues rather than the outcome, and instead of the spin being run around the corridors and chambers of the Justus Lipsius Building in Brussels?  Would he agree that as a first step to opening up the process of the EU as distinct from its focus of attention, that might be a small but significant step?  If he shares that view, why did he not raise it in Cardiff?</P>

      <P>Was there discussion of the mechanism for bringing about institutional change and of how reforms of the treaties, which would be required as a result of any proposed institutional change, would be brought about? Was there discussion of whether national parliaments as distinct from national Governments would have a role in such a process?  It is my view that much of the disenchantment with or disinterest in European affairs is due to the fact that <Col N="1053" /> people see Brussels as being too far away.  People want to see things going on here.  Did that issue arise?</P>
      <P>On the statement from the Council with regard to Kosovo, did the Taoiseach raise the question of suggested military action?  The statement is carefully worded and refers to a stronger response of a qualititively different order, which one must assume means military action.  Did the Taoiseach seek to ensure that any such military action would be taken only under a United Nations Security Council resolution because that would at least provide a legal basis for such action and would obviously have a much broader base of support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were two questions.  On that latter question, Minister Andrews addressed the issue.  That is precisely the point he made, that there should be a UN mandate.</P>
      <P>There was no recommendation, nor is there likely to be, for institutional change or change to the treaties for the next few years.  What is being spoken about is improving the operation of the European Council, the Commission and the various other bodies around it through the more effective streamlining of the decision process, working from a detailed document which was given by President Santer in a verbal presentation to the Council on tomorrow's Commission and on the workings of the Council/Commission into the future.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;concerning the stopping of funding by the Commission for demonstration projects to combat poverty, and I note the comments he made.  Has he checked since then whether any Irish projects are affected by the stopping of the funding?  My understanding is that the European Anti-Poverty Network, which has a section based in Dublin, is affected and there may well be other networks affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of projects affected.  I sent the Deputy a note which he may not have received.  As I understand it, the projects which were approved and which are in operation will be funded.  Because of the judgment, the Commission has stopped any new authorisations pending clarification of the precise meaning of that judgment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the matter on the Order of Business last week and what he said then is my understanding also.  What is challenged is the ability of the Commission to be involved in these kinds of projects where it has no legal base.  The Commission is examining a great number of programmes &mdash; there are over 40 or 50 &mdash; to see where it has a legal base before it continues with them.  The ongoing programmes which were approved and are up and running in any form will be funded.  I do not believe that any of our programmes are affected.  If any are, I will look at them.  That is the understanding I received from officials there.</P>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to double check on the advice he is being given because my understanding of what Commissioner Flynn said to me when I sought information from him in Dublin last Friday at a meeting of the European Institute was that all funding was stopped pending clarification of the legal position. The Commission's opinion, which Commissioner Flynn believes is too narrow an interpretation, means that it does not have the power to spend this money and, therefore, it must cease immediately.  By the end of July, the Commission hopes to have found some way of getting around this.  I ask him to double check that and get back to me.</P>

If I remember correctly, it was a note which the Commission gave me yesterday morning and I think the message I am giving is from a reply which I received from the Commission.  That certainly said that the ongoing programmes, any poverty programmes which were up and running, were all right.  Any new programmes that were not up and running on the date of the European Court judgment will be excluded.  I will supply the Deputy with the note to which I referred if it is still in my possession.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Further discussion took place in respect of crime and drugs in terms of proceeding on the path of co-operation, building on the Amsterdam Treaty, encouraging closer liaison between police forces and trying to remove ambiguities in member states' legal systems. Ongoing progress is being made and people are of the opinion that improvements in these areas are proving effective.  However, it may take anything up to three years before they take full effect.

People remain concerned that while unemployment is decreasing in countries such as Ireland it continues to increase in many other European countries.  Greater cohesion among member states in respect of the employment pacts &mdash; the Irish model is seen as a good example from which to work &mdash; would probably lead to improved operation and increased benefits. The Austrian Presidency will attempt to encourage that improvement before the Vienna Summit.</P>

The question to which I refer related to my Department, where those discussions have already begun.  Performance pay will not be automatic, as per Partnership 2000, and must be negotiated within each Department. Payments will only be made on the basis of an assessment that real change can be implemented. The 2 per cent increase is not automatic and it will not be given if change does not occur or if new policies are not implemented.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 21, inclusive, together.  I am keeping an open mind in respect of the future of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  It could be held that with regard to the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement, including those relating to the civic forum in Northern Ireland, the possible North-South consultative forum, and the inter-parliamentary links for which it provides, it would be appropriate to bring the proceedings of the forum to an orderly close following a final meeting. This will have to be considered by all parties <Col N="1058" /> to the forum and, at this stage, it would be prudent to keep the matter under review in light of the evolution of events.</P>
      <P>I had a positive meeting with the US Secretary of Commerce, Mr. William Daley, on 11 June.  I expressed the Government's appreciation to Mr. Daley for leading such a high level delegation of US business interests to Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  In my meeting with Mr. Gerry Adams we discussed recent developments, including forthcoming parades and, more generally, the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>I have had a wide range of meetings relating to Northern Ireland recently, including those on which I reported extensively in recent weeks.  I do not propose to go into detail on every meeting I have had.  However, I assure the House that all of my meetings are aimed at finding the best way forward to secure an effective and successful implementation of the provisions of the agreement.</P>

It would be beneficial to society in the Republic if we continued to examine those issues and aspects of society which need to be reformed.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the case that people claiming social welfare payments are required to make their claim within a specified period.  Where a claim is not made on time payment can only be backdated for a specified period the duration of which varies with the type of claim.</P>
      <P>Legislation in this matter has recently been significantly improved in the case of retirement, old age and survivors contributory pensions.  Previously the general limit on backdating of payments was six months.  The limit is now 12 months as provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1997. This means that full arrears are now paid for up to 12 months prior to the date of claim.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under regulations which I made last February, the proportion of arrears due in respect of the period beyond 12 months may also be paid.  The regulations also provide for the possibility of full arrears in cases where claims are delayed due to <i>force majeure,</i> proven incapacity on the part of the applicant, to departmental error and to alleviate current financial hardship.</P>
      <P>Payment of full arrears in all late claims cases, regardless of the circumstances for the delay in claiming, would give rise to extremely significant ongoing additional costs.  It is also reasonable in the context of proper management of the system that people claim on time and have the responsibility for so doing.  Apart from the cost of financing late claims the administration and processing involved is time consuming and inefficient, especially where circumstances may have to be verified long after the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes which have recently been made represent a significant improvement in the position that has applied heretofore and strike a reasonable balance between the need for effective management of the system and appropriate <Col N="1062" /> recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.  I strongly encourage people to submit claims promptly to my Department if they consider they might be eligible under a scheme. In this way they will receive their full entitlements from the time their need first arose.  Information and scheme claim forms are widely available throughout the country, from my Department and from other information centres, on the range of social welfare services available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, this has been an issue for a number of years.  For many years the norm was that backdating was allowed for only three months, but some exceptions were made for good cause cases when backdating could was allowed for a further three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Over that period the six months arrears period became the norm.  This matter is not as simple as just answering the Deputy's question. He was a member of a party that was in Government not so long ago which considered this issue in depth and he voted to change the law in the Social Welfare Act, l997 which provided for the backdating of claims for a 12 month period. I followed up that by introducing regulations required under that legislation passed by the rainbow coalition Government.  I accept that it struck a reasonable balance between giving people their arrears and recognising the Department has difficulty in dealing with cases involving extremely late claims.  What is required is that people should be given proper information and the Department should do whatever it can to readily provide that.</P>

Everyone should get his or her due.  I would like the Minister to follow through on the progress made by the last Government.  If somebody owed the Department money, would the Minister not chase that person to get the last bob due unless there were extenuating circumstances?  It is only right that people legally entitled to a pension should be given the full amount they are due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ombudsman considered this issue in great detail and produced a report on it last year which <Col N="1063" /> contained some good recommendations.  The tenor of that report was that efforts should be made to ensure people who are owed money are paid it in full.  The Ombudsman particularly mentioned in the recommendations, that the Department should notify all potential contributory pensioners of their possible entitlement, but that is not being done.  Will the Minister accept it is unjust and inequitable that people are denied their full entitlement to arrears in respect of their pensions?</P>

      <P>The recommendations in the report will be fully considered in the context of developing coherent, progressive and effective policies for families as promised in the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to adopting a &ldquo;families first&rdquo; approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies.  In line with this commitment and in response to recommendations from the commission the Government has established a new family affairs unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and has provided an additional £2.75 million for the development of family services in my Department <Col N="1064" /> in the last budget.  That includes: £700,000 for a network of family and community services resource centres; an extra £600,000 for support for marriage counselling services; and an extra £600,000 for the expansion of the family mediation service.</P>
    <P>The family affairs unit is responsible for support for the marriage counselling services and the family mediation service as well as a number of other family services, including a pilot programme to provide improved support to families from local offices of the Department through the one stop shop model and the introduction of an information programme on parenting issues.</P>
    <P>The unit has been given a specific responsibility to pursue the findings in the commission's report following its consideration by the Government.  In pursuing the findings of the report the unit will work with the other Departments which are affected by the commission's recommendations.

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The full report of the Commission on the Family has not been made available to Opposition spokespersons.  I got a copy of the document in the Library.  The Minister gave a commitment on the day he launched the report that he would not let dust settle on it, but the dust appears to be settling on it because I have not yet received a copy of it.  The report contains the most in-depth research available on the modern family.  In particular, the research on child care and pre-school education provide damning evidence that major shortfalls exist and need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  I understand the Cabinet is actively considering the priorities it intends to address in the autumn budget.  Will the Minister give a commitment that the commitments given in Partnership 2000 and in the national anti-poverty strategy will be seriously considered and that significant funding will be earmarked for child care services and pre-school education?</P>

    <P>In a report of that size there are bound to be many recommendations.  The Deputy is correct that some of its most substantial recommendations relate to the issue of child care.  Those recommendations will be considered by the expert group on child care under Partnership 2000 which is considering this issue.  All the issues raised about child care will be considered closely <Col N="1065" /> by the Government not only in the context of the forthcoming budget but in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>whether he will amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, to make it clear that pension increases paid to widows for their dependent children are paid in trust for those children and should not be liable to tax clawback.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <P>Social welfare legislation provides that an increase in pension shall be paid to a widow or widower in receipt of a contributory widow's or widower's pension in respect of a qualified child or qualified children.  A qualified child for this purpose is defined as a person who is ordinarily resident in the State; who is not detained in a reformatory or industrial school; and is under the age of 18 years or over age 18 and under age 21 and in full-time education.</P>
      <P>The existing provisions governing the taxation of widow's contributory pension are set down in section 126 of the Taxes (Consolidation) Act 1997.  The full amount of the pension payable to the widow, including the child dependant component, is assessable for tax purposes.  The amount of tax payable, if any, would depend on the overall income and circumstances of the individual concerned.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputy refers to the recent Supreme Court judgment in the case of Seán Ó Síocháin, Inspector of Taxes, and Bridget Neenan.  The Supreme Court ruled that the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Acts provided for an increase in the widow's contributory pension in respect of the child payable to the widow and not a pension for the child payable to the widow.  The effect of the judgment is that the existing taxation provisions remain unchanged so that such income continues to be assessable for income tax under the Income Tax Acts.</P>
      <P>Any change to the tax treatment of a contributory pension would involve a change in tax legislation and would be a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I remind the Deputy that the Minister for Finance is aware of the problems facing widowed people, especially in the period following the bereavement.  Accordingly, he made substantial improvements in the budget to the widowed parent bereavement allowance.</P>

      <P>Where does the Minister stand on this issue?  Does he accept that it is a cod to pay a relatively small child dependant <Col N="1066" /> allowance for the children of widows &mdash; about £15 per week &mdash; which is taxed?  Does he agree it would be fairer not to subject the allowance to tax?  Is that Minister aware that under the Garda widow's pension scheme, for example, the courts found that such payments for children are not liable for tax?  Does he agree that an anomaly exists with the social welfare payment?</P>

      <P>In this instance there are fundamental issues related to tax policy which are taken into account in a budgetary context.  If one was to make a taxation policy change in this area all other schemes involving child dependant allowances would have to be examined.  The judgment in the Neenan case does not change existing policy and the Supreme Court drew a distinction between it and the Garda pension scheme.  In the Neenan case it decided that the social welfare provisions indicate that the beneficial entitlement to the entirety of the social welfare payment is vested in the widow, whereas in the Garda scheme that is not the case because there is a specific reference to the children's contributory pension.</P>

      <Quest>when the fuel allowance at £5 per week was introduced by his Department; the cumulative rate of inflation since that time; the current value of the allowance if it had been indexed linked since its introduction; and the plans, if any, he has to increase the allowance.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard rate of fuel allowance was last increased in October 1985, when the rate was raised to £5 per week.  An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale <Col N="1067" /> of bituminous coal in these areas.  This was later extended to Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.  The smokeless fuel allowance will be further extended to Limerick city, Wexford town, Arklow, Drogheda and Dundalk and to their contiguous built up areas from October 1998 to coincide with the introduction of a ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.</P>
      <P>The fuel and light component of the consumer price index rose by 7.8 per cent between August 1985 and May 1998 &mdash; details are provided in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.  Increasing the basic allowance by 7.8 per cent would increase the rate from £5 to £5.39 per week.  The estimated cost of increasing fuel allowances for all recipients by 39p per week in the 1998-9 fuel season is £3 million.</P>
      <P>The fuel allowance payment rate cannot be viewed in isolation from the rate of weekly pensions, benefits and assistance payments, which have increased ahead of the rate of inflation since the current rate of the fuel allowance was fixed. Substantial increases in all the social welfare primary payments of either £3 or £5 per week are being paid from the beginning of June 1998.  Any increase in the fuel allowance payment rate would have to be considered in a budgetary context, having regard to increases in basic payment rates and the modest increase in domestic fuel prices during that time.</P>
      <P>In addition to the national fuel scheme, there is a facility to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs which is available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Under the SWA scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement.  This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments. An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>

        <i>Additional Information.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme for an exceptional needs payment. The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that the <Col N="1068" /> CPI has changed by 33 per cent between 1985 and 1995.  I take that figure from the review of the national fuel scheme by Goodbody consultants. The Minister did not refer to that review, which recommended that the fuel allowance should be increased to £10 per week.  He has been in office for a year and has had a chance to take action. Does he consider it reasonable to pay heed to the consultants' recommendations?  They considered it a well targeted scheme for those in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this scheme in the context of last year's budget.  I decided that it would be far more focused on the needs of the elderly and less well off to give a substantial increase to those over 65 or 66 years as appropriate, although it is a more costly option.  Therefore, I had no scope for changing the free fuel scheme.  The figures for the fuel and light component of the CPI cover electricity, gas, coal and other domestic fuels and they show that from August 1985 to May 1998 there has been an increase of 7.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Goodbody report recommends a £10 increase over the next few years and I will consider that in the context of budgetary changes.  As I said, I felt it would be preferable to give an increase of £5 for 52 weeks a year rather than an increase in the free fuel allowance for a 26 week period.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that families who are recipients of unemployment benefit can, in certain circumstances, receive substantially lower weekly payments than similar size families who are in receipt of unemployment assistance and the plans, if any, he has to alleviate this anomaly.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14412/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's concerns centre on the nature of child income support provided in conjunction with unemployment benefit and long-term unemployment assistance.  Child dependant allowances are payable with social welfare payments in respect of children up to the age of 18 years.  The allowances continue to be payable where children are in full time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the twenty second birthday, provided that the claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment.  These arrangements do not apply to short-term payments such as unemployment benefit, disability benefit, short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
      <P>The more favourable treatment of people on long-term payments, including long-term unemployment assistance, is in recognition that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.  It is possible, therefore, that a recipient of long-term unemployment assistance with a child or children aged over 18 and in full-time education could have a higher income than a claimant of unemployment benefit in similar circumstances, assuming that neither household had any other sources of income. Given the rationale I have outlined for drawing a distinction between long-term and short-term payment recipients, I do not agree with the Deputy's view that this is an anomalous situation.</P>
      <P>He will be aware the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring child income support is more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our more effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Deputy will be aware the child benefit scheme will be further enhanced with effect from September.  The payment will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3.00 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  In addition a special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is unjust that a person who has paid PRSI for many years could receive up to £27 less per week than a person with a similar sized family?  He is also denied the Christmas bonus, butter vouchers, fuel allowances, etc.  Does he further agree it is unjust that an individual who contributed to this scheme should be treated in that way?  What steps will he take to amend it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want him to repeat his statement that <Col N="1070" /> child benefit is more focused.  I agree with him, but it is unfair that somebody who contributed to the scheme over a number of years should be penalised.  If he refers to child benefit again, he might mention the great improvements made to it by the previous Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt the previous Government and others before that decided on a policy of freezing CBAs and putting the available money into child benefit because it is more focused on the people that matter and is delivered more directly, particularly to families on low income.  It also does not act as a disincentive to going back to work, unlike CBAs.  The issue of treating long-term payments differently to those short-term payments is in recognition of the fact that long-term social welfare recipients are much more at risk from poverty than short-term recipients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree it is difficult to justify that to an individual who made weekly contributions for years and finds he gets £27 per week less than his neighbour?  Does the Minister consider this to be unfair, in addition to the other supplementary welfare benefits he loses?  Will he concede there is a justifiable case for anger in an individual who made such contributions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It may very well be, in the case to which the Deputy refers &mdash; perhaps he could give me details of it &mdash; that there are different circumstances and he is not treating the two cases equally.  There may well be extra income in the UB family which, in effect, reduces the level of benefit.  People are treated differently in this respect because of the principle of assisting people who are on long-term as opposed to short-term social welfare assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 48, 112 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>On arrival in the State, asylum seekers are classed as homeless and are provided with temporary accommodation until they secure rented accommodation.  The temporary accommodation is usually a bed and breakfast, but hostel and hotel accommodation is also used.  There are 1,432 cases, comprised of single people and families, in hostel or bed and breakfast accommodation. The cost of temporary accommodation is met from the Department of the Environment and Local Government Vote, but once private rented accommodation is secured, the rent is supplemented through the Supplementary Welfare Allowance, SWA, scheme funded from my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a rent supplement is determined by the health boards in accordance with the appropriate legislative provisions.  When assessing a claim for rent supplement health boards are obliged by legislation to ensure the accommodation is suitable to the residential and other needs of the applicant and that the rent payable by the claimant is just and proper having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.  This criteria also applies to hostels and bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
      <P>The SWA scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department.  It provides entitlement to any persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The question of whether any person has a legitimate right and entitlement to reside in Ireland is a matter for the immigration authorities.  This issue does not arise in connection with claims for supplementary welfare allowance as there is no provision for restricting payments on the basis of nationality, normal residence or the legality of the person's presence in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers and other immigrants can qualify for a basic weekly SWA payment; rent supplement if they are staying in rented accommodation; exceptional needs payments if they <Col N="1072" /> have needs which cannot be met from their weekly SWA payment; fuel allowance of either £5 or £8 per week in winter and spring and child supports, where appropriate, including child benefit, back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  SWA provides the lowest rates of weekly payment within the social welfare system. Payment may continue as long as the asylum seeker is resident in the State.</P>
    <P>Approximately three quarters of asylum seekers are single people, mostly males without dependants, and are paid £68.40 per week.  In addition, if they are living in rented accommodation they may qualify for a rent supplement.  As of the beginning of June 1998, SWA payments were being made to 3,000 households in respect of approximately 3,800 adults and 1,200 children. Child benefit is also paid as appropriate.  Expenditure on SWA payments for asylum seekers to date is estimated at a maximum of £13 million. The total expenditure for 1997 was approximately £12 million.  The information requested by the Deputy is not available for earlier years, but as there were fewer asylum seekers at that time, expenditure would have been lower.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure by my Department on asylum seekers in 1998 and later years will depend on a number of factors, including the numbers arriving, the length of stay in temporary accommodation and the length of time it takes to finalise asylum applications.  The Deputy will appreciate it is not possible to provide precise estimates of costs for future years.</P>

      <P>And, indeed, storming out through the Opposition benches on another occasion. With regard to the standard of accommodation, the Minister said bed and breakfast and hotel accommodation is provided and the facilities are also available for those who are known to be illegal immigrants.  Has he considered putting a mechanism in place whereby a person is accommodated for a period and, if found to be an illegal immigrant, can be transported out of the country? I raised this matter at an Eastern Health Board meeting and have been advised it is a matter for the Minister's Department &mdash; the health boards make the payment under the scheme if it is <Col N="1073" /> deemed right but it is up to the Minister, the architect of the scheme, to ensure regulations are met.  I am concerned by reports that houses are being purchased in the Dublin area to provide basic accommodation for people, although the properties may not meet local authority criteria for such accommodation.  However, it will take time for the system to act.  In relation to Question No. 35, could the Minister clarify, either now or in writing to myself or the health boards, the criteria required for approved accommodation, and whether he agrees that payment should not be made if the accommodation is not approved?</P>

Could the Minister indicate the number of families in the Eastern Health Board area &mdash; which is the area dealing with the largest number of those seeking asylum &mdash; who are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance? My understanding is that 11 such families have been assisted under this scheme in that area; that information comes from a question to the EHB of which the Minister's colleague is a member, so presumably he has the information.</P>

      <P>Yes but I am talking about families and making a distinction between SWA and rent supplement.  The question related to accommodation for asylum seekers or illegal immigrants and my understanding, having seen an Eastern Health Board reply to a similar question, is that the number of families in its area is 11, which would undermine the scapegoating of asylum seekers which continually takes place.</P>

The Deputy's question is probably more properly addressed to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  My Department pays rent supplement in respect of private rented accommodation but hostel and bed and breakfast accommodation is taken care of by the other Department.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate the likely total payment to asylum seekers and illegal immigrants in 1998, and the percentage yearly increases for the previous five years?  Could he also indicate the type and value of payments which illegal immigrants and asylum seekers may claim, and outline other schemes under which they are entitled to claim?  To ensure that no one picks this up incorrectly, I am referring solely to illegal immigrants or asylum seekers who have not been approved for refugee status.  One of my questions asks the Minister whether he is satisfied that there are adequate supports for genuine refugees.  That is the backdrop to the questions I have posed about illegal immigrants or unapproved asylum seekers.</P>

Given that, the overall figure would be in the region of £30 million.  The provision of supplementary welfare allowance to asylum seekers, refugees or anyone resident in the State is well governed in the legislation.

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.  An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.</P>

      <P>The smokeless fuel allowance was later extended to Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995 and will be further extended to Limerick City, Wexford town, Arklow, Drogheda and Dundalk and to their contiguous built-up areas from the start of the next fuel season in October 1998, to coincide with the introduction of a ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.

      <P>The free fuel scheme is not temperature related and there may be occasions when the allowance is not paid, even though temperatures are unseasonably cold. However, as the scheme extends over six months of the year, from mid October to mid April, this is likely to an exception rather than the rule.  Any extension of the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications.  For example, to extend the <Col N="1076" /> scheme by a further two weeks to the end of April would cost £4 million.</P>

I decided it would be better to give people, particularly old age pensioners, £5 per week for 52 weeks of the year rather than a modest increase in the fuel allowance for a 26 week period.  I accept it does not apply totally to the same recipients, but the option which I took was much more costly in a budgetary context.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board recently presented me with its report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative entitled Securing Retirement Income.</P>
      <P>In response to the main recommendations of the report, I issued a four page document called Action on Pensions which was circulated to all Deputies along with the report itself.  This document, for the first time in the history of the State, set out a clear Government plan to secure the future of our older people.</P>
      <P>Overall, the recommendations of the Pensions Board involve the development of strong first pillar social welfare pensions based on social insurance and major improvements in our second pillar &mdash; occupational and personal pensions.</P>
      <P>The Government in its response to the main recommendations of the report has, <i>inter alia</i>, noted the recommendation to increase the social welfare pension over a five to ten year period to 34 per cent of average industrial earnings.  In this regard, a key priority, as part of the Government action programme for older people, is substantial social welfare increases, including increases in the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period.  An important step to achieving this objective was taken through the £5 per week increase granted in the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>The whole question of increases in the rates of social welfare pensions and the PRSI financing implications of these will fall to be examined in the context of the overall budgetary situation and economic climate.</P>
      <P>Working groups are being set up to examine fully the recommendation for an explicit fund to minimise the additional burden on future generations of taxpayers from the proposals contained in the report, to progress the setting up of the personal retirement savings accounts recommended by the board, which has been accepted in principle by the Government, and to examine further and progress the report's proposals regarding the introduction of more simple and flexible tax arrangements which again have been accepted in principle by the Government.  This group will also examine, at my request and that of the Government, the issue of an earnings cap in relation to tax relief on pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government welcomes the board's target <Col N="1078" /> of achieving 70 per cent second pillar pension coverage of those over 30 years of age and also supports the board's recommendations on an effective education and awareness programme.  I have also undertaken to initiate a review of the Pensions Board, when appropriate and in the light of developments.</P>
    <P>The Government has also accepted the board's proposals in relation to access, vesting, preservation and revaluation and integration.  These will require amendments to the Pensions Act and will be introduced at the next suitable opportunity.</P>
    <P>With regard to the timescale for implementation of the proposals, Deputies will appreciate that, in view of the working groups and probable need for detailed legislation, it is difficult to be precise on this aspect.  However, I am committed to implementing the proposals as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Pensions Board on the production of the report on the NPPI, the national pensions policy initiative. I welcome the Minister's support for it, as far as that goes.

It was an immediate response which details, in a fairly easy to read way, all the recommendations and the action we propose to take on each of them.  I echo the Deputy's sentiments.  The Pensions Board has carried out a very good exercise for us.  I compliment the Deputy on being part of the initiation of this whole process.</P>

      <P>What is the difference between &ldquo;accepting in principle&rdquo;, &ldquo;deserves full examination&rdquo;, &ldquo;notes and welcomes&rdquo; and &ldquo;agrees to examine further&ldquo;?  Is the Minister telling the House he accepts all the recommendations in principle, that some of them can be implemented immediately and that some need more examination in terms of how they are to be implemented?  Or does he believe that some of the recommendations are not implementable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, we should achieve all the recommendations, which is what we are saying in the Action on Pensions document. That is why we undertook in a number of instances to set up working groups to achieve the <Col N="1079" /> recommendations of the NPPI.  The Government sees the report as a map for the future in regard to providing security for our older people.  We recognise this issue will not be addressed by just this Government but also by future Governments and policy makers for quite a number of years.</P>
      <P>The future demographic changes outlined in the actuarial report which was factored into this examination of the pensions issue show conclusively that the ratio between our working and ageing populations will change very dramatically over the next 60 years.  It will be on the plus side for only the first 20 of those years.  We need to plan now to ensure that we have sufficient resources to provide for a much greater proportion of an older population.  The Government accepts the recommendations of the report and will be endeavouring, as far as possible, to look at all the issues the recommendations raise.  Some of them can be easily implemented.  Others will require further examination with a view to implementing them, if at all possible, in the future.</P>

      <P>I also pay tribute to the Pensions Board for producing this document. In the document, Action on Pensions, the Minister has been vague on many issues.  There is one issue about which I am concerned.  It relates to the uptake of pension schemes by young people. The board recommends that an education programme be put in place to advise young people of the importance of this.  Will the Minister advise me whether he intends to put money into an awareness programme for young people?  It would be money well spent in the long run.  Will the Minister take it up as a priority?</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department, prior to the implementation of budgetary increases, indicated on pension books that recipients would receive an increase of £5 per week and the adult dependant £1.50 per week when only pensioners in receipt of the maximum rate were granted this increase when new books were issued and those in receipt of reduced pensions only received a percentage increase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the 1998 budgetary increases and, in particular, those provided for recipients of old age contributory <Col N="1080" /> and retirement mixed insurance and EU <i>pro rata</i> pensions.</P>
      <P>This year's budget provided for a special catch-up increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments for pensioners aged 65 and over, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for people on reduced rate contributory pensions.</P>
      <P>In this instance, the rerated pension books which issued to a number of people &mdash; 240 &mdash; in receipt of <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory and retirement pensions erroneously indicated that their budgetary increase would be the percentage payable to those normally in receipt of the maximum personal rate of payment. When my Department discovered this inaccuracy, a mailshot was immediately issued to all those concerned, informing them of their correct rate of entitlement and the calculation basis for same.</P>
      <P>A priority of this budget was to advance the position of our older people.  The special increases provided for older people forms part of the implementation process of this Government's commitment, in our Action Programme for the Millennium, to increase contributory old age pensions to £100 over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>In addition, and in recognition of the fact that the 1998 budget was announced at a date earlier than in previous years, the increases in social welfare payment rates have come into effect from the first week in June.  This means that the improved and higher payment rates will be paid for 31 weeks this year as opposed to 29 weeks in previous years.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I ask him to reply personally to the 240 people who were notified that they would receive an increase of £5 a week and did not receive it.  Will the Minister agree that many pensioners were misled by the Minister's statement that pensioners would get an increase of £5 when, effectively, for a couple dependent on the maximum level of old age pension, the net gain was £3.25?  Will the Minister write personally to the 240 people in question.</P>

      <P>A mailshot issued to the 240 people who received erroneous information.  In the budget statement, and in my own budget speech, the increase for old age pensioners was clearly stated &mdash; 270,000 pensioners aged 66 or over were to have their pensions increased by £5 a week with some 54,000 on the reduced rate of contributory pension receiving proportionate increases.  About 8,900 people got increases of between £3 and £5.  A mix-up occurred in relation to the 240 people in question.  It was not possible to automatically calculate the correct budgetary increase for them because of the type of contributory pension they had.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the question of traveller settlement is one of the most contentious issues in any community.  In a great many parts of this city we have made great advances in the past few years.  However, provision is uneven. Traveller sites have been located mainly close to or in the middle of working class communities, in communities that have been able to accept them, albeit with certain reservations.  The one I know best, Avila Park in Finglas, a 1960s development, has grown to be an integral part of the community where the residents play a full and active part in their community and are regarded, rightly, as participants in that community with the same rights and entitlements as others.  Unfortunately the adjacent local authority, Fingal County Council, has over the years developed a practice, which I am glad is being counteracted in this Bill, of locating sites literally on the border between Fingal County Council and Dublin Corporation, with no consultation or proper planning.  This has created unease among the settled community and has greatly annoyed the travellers who are settled in housing schemes and halting sites in the area. They regard it as totally unfair that they should be treated in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is important in a great many respects. It puts traveller accommodation on the same level playing pitch as other accommodation provided by local authorities.  I welcome this.  It is transparent and up front, and all the members of the community have an opportunity to co-operate in formulating a plan for assessing the needs of the travelling community.  It is significant that the Pavée Point Traveller Centre and the Irish Travellers' Movement have both given the Bill a warm <Col N="1083" /> welcome.  They have suggested some amendments, including that the initial letter of the proper noun &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; be capitalised.  The Minister should take that on board.  It may be only a symbolic gesture but it is an important one.</P>
    <P>Due to the time constraints I will limit myself to a number of specific points.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion of the development of traveller sites in the planning process albeit under the part 10 consultation process.  I would have preferred if local authorities were obliged to go through the full planning process because there would be greater acceptance among the local community if the system were exhausted.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of setting a maximum size on sites.  From my experience and from discussing this matter with many settled travellers in my own constituency, approximately 20 families per site should be regarded as the maximum.  I know of other sites in the Fingal County Council area which are a travesty of accommodation.  They are far too big and it is impossible for any sense of community to be developed.</P>
    <P>I welcome under section 18 the proposal that two adjacent authorities or more can formulate a plan.  That is important because those of us in Fingal County Council, for example, have not had any input to setting up these sites.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the national travellers' accommodation committee and the local consultative committees.  I ask the Minister to consider including others, particularly the local communities immediately affected, in the consultative process.  I am not certain that the strategic policy committee system suggested by the Minister will be effective.  Local residents' associations and recognised residents' groups ought to have an involvement on an equal basis in the consultation process with the travellers' groups.  It will be helpful for both sides in that they would be aware of each other's points of view.</P>
    <P>The extension of the strong estate management measures in the 1997 Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act is important.  Deputy Ring referred to the intimidation that takes place on traveller sites by travellers.  We have had a number of very serious incidents, some fatal, in my constituency where travellers came uninvited to other sites and the settled travellers, who are bona fide residents, had no influence in regard to their ejection.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures in the Bill to deal with unauthorised sites.  There is a hierarchy among the travelling community, as in every community. There are those who are very poor and there are those who are relatively wealthy.  Some provision should be made for dealing with the traders who are quite wealthy but who can set up in an area, as they have done in Dunsink Lane in Finglas for the past 18 to 20 years, and sell cars, tyres and furniture.  These people do not pay a brass farthing to the Revenue Commissioners.  They tap into the electricity supply very effectively.  That <Col N="1084" /> problem could be addressed by developing a small number of sites throughout the country where the going rate would be charged for the provision of quality services.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  It is worthwhile legislation which will contribute greatly to the improvement of the lifestyles of travellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this long overdue Bill, the primary purpose of which is to provide a framework and a determined approach to meeting the accommodation needs of travellers.</P>
      <P>The public can sometimes perceive travellers as a troublesome lot but that is not the case.  There are many troublesome people in the settled community and we should not label everybody in the same way.  Sometimes we confuse traders, who live on sites with their £30,000 jeeps, with genuine travellers.  If I paid cash for a £30,000 jeep I am sure the Revenue Commissioners would want to know where I got the money.  The same rules should apply across the board.  If these traders are amassing personal wealth, they should be taxed accordingly and obliged to produce tax clearance certificates the same as everybody else.</P>
      <P>The Bill will create a new deal for travellers, promote social inclusion and counter discrimination. Despite much effort, the position in regard to accommodation for travellers is most unsatisfactory.  A number of travellers live on unofficial sites in unhygienic conditions.  Health hazards abound and I have seen children running around these sites in the muck and dirt.  The Bill will go a long way towards tackling that problem.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have failed in their responsibility to maintain the official sites.  Belcamp and Caragh Park, in my own area, are home to decent travellers who integrated very well with the local community but, unfortunately, travellers from Dundalk and other areas have set up home among the travellers officially residing on the site. That has created problems but the local authority has turned a blind eye.</P>
      <P>Approximately 44 per cent of travellers are located in the greater Dublin area.  Unauthorised sites continue to be a source of concern to the public because of lack of facilities and so on.  The problem of unauthorised encampments is largely related to the lack of permanent accommodation. A great deal of money has been spent by local authorities on traveller sites.  They should exercise greater control in regard to these sites but that is not currently the case.  As Deputy Carey mentioned, many travellers put their lives in danger by tapping into the electricity supply.  I have seen electricity cables stretched across sites which is a hazard.  A number of travellers are involved in tree pruning and removing rubbish from households.  Unfortunately, they dump the rubbish on the side of the road and the local authorities have to clean it up.  If I did that, it would not be tolerated.  We must address all those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents a comprehensive and balanced <Col N="1085" /> response by the Government to the difficulties experienced over a long period in seeking to meet the accommodation needs of travellers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady" hpid="Mr. J. Brady Mr. J. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Bill before the House will finally bring to an end the long saga associated with the provision of accommodation for the genuine members of the travelling community. As a member of Meath County Council since 1974, a member of many community groups and now a Member of this House, I am confident that the Minister, with his experience and forward planning ability, will ensure my hopes are materialised in this regard.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, 144 families lived on the roadside in County Meath.  Today ten families live on the roadside although not all those families are permanent residents of the county.  Meath County Council has 85 families in housing accommodation in addition to 42 families in halting sites.  I wish other county councils would follow suit. While some county councils do a good job, many of them do nothing.  Now is the time for a clear, unequivocal definition of the problem.  I respect the rights of the travelling community, but I also respect the rights of the settled community.  I have a mandate to ensure the rights of the settled community are safeguarded and protected.  There must be a clear definition of the people referred to in the Bill.  I presume it is the traditional travelling families the Minister wishes to accommodate, and I fully support that.</P>
      <P>I wish to sound a word of warning and bring serious matters to the attention of the Minister, the Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  There are now new age travellers, including travelling contractors, who travel in convoys of ten, 15 or 20 caravans and jeeps.  In my area in Oldcastle the Fairgreen, which is the access road to the local GAA park and pitch and putt club, was invaded by travellers. In the space of a couple of hours boulders were moved by specially equipped trucks, barriers broken down and an unauthorised settlement foisted on the town.  The GAA park and pitch and putt course are now used as public toilets and are unusable for their intended purposes.  Local people who used the park for daily walks can no longer do so.</P>
      <P>The travellers who moved into the area sell gates, quote terms for tarmacadaming of yards and paint houses and sheds.  In many cases they use intimidation if people are reluctant to buy their services.  An old age pensioner who lives alone refused an offer to tarmacadam her yard and went to her family for a couple of days to avoid intimidation.  When she returned her yard had been tarmacadamed and a man was waiting at her gate demanding payment.  All dealings are done by cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Revenue Commissioners aware that those people are buying and selling without paying VAT and tax?  There are reports that a manufacturer has been ordered to cease manufacturing <Col N="1086" /> because of huge sums owed to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners pass these travellers day in day out on their way to check out the revenue sources of the settled community, but they should also check out these people.</P>
    <P>Why has the system become so complicated?  It may take up to three months to have legal proceedings instituted to move these people.  Why are they immune from prosecution under the Litter Act?  Why are they allowed disrupt local organisations, such as those I mentioned, without prosecution?  The actions of travellers must be urgently investigated and appropriate steps taken to protect legitimate outlets for products sold by travellers.  I hope the Bill addresses this serious problem and the needs of the genuine travelling community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mindful there is not much time and I will confine my remarks to a few sentences. I welcome Deputy Brady's contribution. It strikes a balance in this whole debate.  The core of this Bill is the emphasis on travellers' rights. Too often the rights of the settled community appear to be ignored, and that is reflected to some extent in the Bill.  That is one of my problems with it.  I see the Bill as a welcome, positive move in terms of the five year plan.  I accept the principle of the Bill but, like many other speakers, I wonder how effective will it be.  I hope we will not have to come back here in a year or two years having experienced the same level of frustration on this issue.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a positive step, the first step my party has taken in this regard.  My constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Flood, played a leading role in evolving this policy.  Nobody believes it is a lasting resolution of the difficulties that have existed down the years between the travellers and the settled community.  I agree with Deputy Brady it is galling for communities that are over-taxed and have to pay high education bills and so on to have to put up with halting sites which house travellers who own newly registered jeeps and cars.  Those sites are supported at the taxpayers' expense.  I echo Deputy Brady's remarks that the Revenue Commissioners should regularly visit halting sites to ensure full tax compliance among travellers.  Perhaps the Minister will include that by way of amendment to the Bill. Tax compliance should be a condition of the use of a publicly-funded halting site.  If any of us appeared with a newly registered jeep, questions would be asked in this House and the Public Offices Commission would investigate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair that 39 per cent of all halting sites in Dublin are situated in the South Dublin County Council area.  There should be strict limits on the number of sites in each local authority area.  A weakness in the Bill is the provision relating to illegal sites.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that matter with a view to strengthening the powers to close down illegal encampments.  I appeal to him to include the organisation, MEAS, in the <Col N="1087" /> National Travellers' Accommodation Committee. MEAS is a relatively reputable body that represents the rights of the settled community.  It should have a statutory right to representation on the National Travellers' Accommodation Committee, or there should be a compulsory right of consultation with it so that it can express its views and assist local communities who are concerned about halting sites.  I recommend the Bill with conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill whose objectives are laudable.  It is important each local authority shares the burden of dealing with this problem. I have grave reservations about whether the Bill will work.  It is difficult to accommodate indigenous travellers and the question must be asked whether communities will accept transient travellers who move into an area.  I do not know what the solution is, but there will be a problem with the operation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem that some travellers will not share a common site with other groups of travellers.  One traveller family in a halting site may not want other traveller families in the site. This whole matter should be considered in a different way.</P>
      <P>I come from a town where 45 per cent of the population are travellers.  Limerick County Council deals with this issue reasonably effectively on a continuous basis.  There are tensions but there is a high level of tolerance within the two communities. Last year 20 traveller families were housed in the town, which has a population of fewer than 1,500 people.  We must examine why there is a rift between the travelling community and the settled community, which was not always the case.  When I was young travellers were welcomed in rural areas &mdash; Deputy Hayes referred to this matter &mdash; but now the settled community is concerned about the presence of travellers. That is feeding through to travellers who behave in an appropriate way towards the settled community. We often talk about respecting the culture of travellers, but they must also respect the culture of the settled community.  The Government must appoint experts to examine, from a sociological point of view, the different perceptions of the travelling and settled communities. This legislation will not work unless such an examination is carried out.  The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, stated earlier that he hoped this matter would not be politicised at the next council elections.  I assure him it will be brought up on the doorsteps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should visit Rathkeale where there are more than 600 travellers in a town of 1,500 people and that figure can increase <Col N="1088" /> to 1,000 at Christmas time.  There is a degree of tolerance and understanding of travellers in Rathkeale; some are even ministers of the Eucharist.  However, there are some tensions and difficulties in the area.</P>
    <P>We must study the differences between the two communities before we impose solutions that will create conflict and flashpoints.  We must devise solutions that take account of the various needs of travellers.  For example, we must deal with the problems they encounter in getting hotels to hold wedding receptions and so on.  The settled community do not like to see large numbers of horses and caravans moving into an area.  Also, elderly people who live on their own live in fear, sometimes for no reason, when travellers move into their area.  All these matters must be addressed to complement what the Minister of State is doing.  I am not suggesting what he is doing is wrong, I am merely saying it will not work because the other areas are not being addressed.</P>
    <P>Travellers have a right to their culture, but because of that they will remain marginalised. Their women will always be subordinate to their men and their children will be greatly disadvantaged. While I do not agree with its entire contents, the Minister of State should read a letter printed in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> from a Dublin Fianna Fáil councillor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, which was published on 31 March, provides for a number of changes in the legislation relating to travellers.  Under its provisions, Sligo County Council will be obliged in consultation with travellers to prepare and adopt a five year programme for the provision of traveller accommodation in its area.  It is important that the wider community is involved in the debate.  It also provides for a public consultation process in respect of draft traveller accommodation programmes.</P>
      <P>The management and maintenance of halting sites is very important.  The Bill requires county councils to take reasonable steps to ensure the programmes adopted are implemented.  Councils will also be required to set up traveller accommodation consultative committees comprising members, officials and travellers.  The Minister of State should consider appointing well established community representatives as well as representatives from the Catholic Church to those committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning legislation will be amended to include objectives relating to the provision of traveller accommodation in county development plans.  I am pleased the general public will be able to see the development plans.  The Bill also gives councils the power to deal with unauthorised temporary dwellings.  Councils must take the law in their hands and deal effectively with unauthorised camping sites.  The Bill will extend powers to the council to deal with anti-social behaviour.  These powers are currently provided under the housing Acts.  Sligo County Council does not have the power to deal with the anti-social behaviour in <Col N="1089" /> Ballyfree, Carroroe, County Sligo.  I welcome the provision whereby people in local authority houses can be evicted if they do not obey the rules.  This law should also be enforced in respect of halting sites.</P>
    <P>Councils are requested to make the necessary preparation to establish a consultative committee at an early date.  Halting sites are currently located in areas where there is least resistance to them.  Essentially, two members of a local authority have a vote and the council can overrule their decision by a massive majority and provide a halting site in an area.  I am pleased each county will now be required to play its part in providing accommodation for travellers.  Only a number of counties currently play their part.  The Department should insist that councils play their part.  It would take the pressure off the counties who play their part and it would prevent travellers from moving to areas where sites are not provided.</P>
    <P>The consultative committee will provide a forum for the opinions and desires of travellers to be an integral part of any accommodation programme adopted.  Provision should be made for a public input into the preparation or amendment of the accommodation programme.  People should be consulted about what is happening. This and the previous provision should avoid the need for legal action against local authorities in their attempt to provide traveller accommodation. A halting site was provided in Ballyfree at a cost of £500,000.  It is now a sales area for batteries and so on.  That is unfair to the residents of the area.</P>
    <P>In some counties local authorities impose a halting site in a particular area.  There should be an integrated plan within each country.  Because of their nomadic nature, it is difficult for the Minister of State to predict the needs of travellers over a five year period.</P>
    <P>While I accept this does not relate to accommodation needs, the right of travellers to be served by the licensed trade is another cause for concern. There are many other issues that need to be addressed.  The responsibility rests on the Government to ensure the travelling community is integrated into society.  However, as Deputy Neville pointed out, the travelling community has a duty to live up to its responsibilities.  That is where the real problem lies.  Travellers locate in good halting sites and abuse the law left, right and centre.  The Minister of State should consider mending the housing laws to include a provision whereby people can be evicted from halting sites for anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing the Bill before the House.  It is a step in the right direction.  There is a great deal of unrest in so far as travellers are concerned. When I attended school they were known as the knights of the road; today they are known as high-powered dealers who sell gates, feeding troughs, television sets, batteries, copper, lead and so on.  They store these items in huge mounds <Col N="1090" /> along the roadside, perhaps adjacent to housing estates.  In some parts of the country the public are fed up with travellers.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to giving them their rights, but they should be taught how to conduct themselves properly and respect the needs of the general public.  Some of them do not respect themselves, not to mention the general public. Convoys of travellers comprising 40 or 50 exquisite caravans and mobile homes frequently travel from one end of the country to the other and cause mayhem when they arrive in a small town or village.  The gardaí seem to be powerless to move them from one place to another.</P>
      <P>Many travellers in halting sites move to the beaches in the summer.  If travellers are in a recognised halting site, they should be told to stay there or move to another such site.  They should not be allowed to move to the beaches where they terrorise tourists and local people.  That happens in parts of my constituency of Cork South West and the local people are fed up with it.  This should not be tolerated, particularly if they are permanently located in approved halting sites.</P>
      <P>Many new age travellers travel 40 or 50 miles in jeeps and trucks to congregate on the beautiful beaches in west Cork, while others come in horsedrawn caravans with goats and dogs tied behind them.  They hold rave parties and it is often possible to hear the loud music five miles away.  They do not seem to have any consideration for the people living in tourist caravan parks adjacent to them, nor do they realise they are breaking the law.  It could take the gardaí three or four days to move them because they cannot root them out from the sand dunes on the beaches.  This is causing great trouble in my area.</P>

I agree with giving travellers their rights, but I also want to preserve the rights of our citizens.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important Bill. This is an emotive issue.  While I do not wish to disparage any Member's contribution, no amount of wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth will solve the problem we are facing because we need positive action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> As a member of Cavan County Council and Cavan Urban District Council, I know positive action has been taken.  A complex of 11 bungalow units, a courtyard and a small field, where the children keep ponies, has been provided off the centre of Cavan town for itinerant families.  A manager looks after it and the families take great pride in how it is organised.  They are extremely happy there and their children are going to school.  If it is possible to do that in Cavan, why does every local authority not provide a complex for itinerant families in their areas?  Families such as the Cawleys and Maughans who are well known in the Cavan and Longford areas, have settled in this complex.  This problem has been resolved satisfactorily in Cavan.</P>
    <P>Although visitors from Longford, Monaghan, Meath and Leitrim are welcome, they come in large convoys of four wheel drives, newly registered vans and mobile homes.  They usually have gates and other paraphernalia with them.  As more local communities and tidy towns committees close off areas and put up boulders to prevent illegal parking in places where these people traditionally stopped because they want to develop them for tidy towns competitions, itinerant families will be forced to park along principal roads which are extremely dangerous.  Sooner or later a car or lorry will hit these unfortunate people and then everyone will be up in arms.</P>
    <P>There would be fewer families along the roads if more local authorities accepted their responsibilities. Deputy Conor Lenihan said that 40 per cent of the itinerants of County Dublin are in his electoral area.  It is unfair that one electoral area should be expected to accept responsibility for the entire county.  People in Castleknock or Dublin 4 will say they cannot provide sites for such families.  However, if we can do it in Cavan, it can be done in every other county.</P>
    <P>The families in the development in Cavan town often have visitors which is understandable.  We will not solve this problem overnight but travellers can be integrated.  The Cawley family, for example, has moved into a housing estate and has settled in extremely well.  They are excellent people in their own right.  They are used to travelling because that is how they grew up.</P>
    <P>There are people in all walks of society, even in the settled community, who will create trouble. However, once that trouble is caused by an itinerant family, it is blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, there is a view that serious crime is caused by itinerants.  It is wrong to blacken them in this way.</P>
    <P>There is a solution to this problem.  I invite the Minister and his officials to visit Cavan to see what we have done to try to resolve it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the sentiments expressed in the Bill.  We are all familiar with the lifestyle of travellers.  I agree that the conditions in which they live must be addressed and improved.  It is appropriate, therefore, to seek to ensure that the disadvantaged community gets equal rights and opportunities.  It is also important that we have equality before the law as some of the difficulties experienced relate to a perception that this does not apply.</P>
      <P>The Bill deals with accommodation but the solution will not be found in accommodation alone. In the past the issue was examined on a statistical rather than a comprehensive basis.  One must accept that the settlement of travellers is important.  There must be proper and adequate education for traveller children and home management courses so that they have better prospects and opportunities than their parents.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Kerry Diocesan Youth Centre, which is one of the many groups that play a useful role in providing training and education.  It provides special courses for travellers to assist them to participate fully in a settled lifestyle.  These courses will also be the key to employment which will be essential to help them change their lifestyle.</P>
      <P>We have based our economic development over the past decade on partnership.  Those of us involved in local authorities who have grappled with the traveller issue for many years will be aware that without a partnership approach we are doomed to failure.  I welcome the provision in the Bill for consultation.</P>
      <P>The rights of travellers in the community in general must be examined.  The Minister of State did not mention dealing with the responsibility of travellers other than the fact that a committee will be set up comprising members of the Irish Traveller Movement, various groups and representatives of the travellers at local level.  Tributes should be paid to social workers.  In Kerry, Mr. Jack Tonra has worked extremely hard in the past number of years.  Every traveller in Kerry and in a much wider area knows and trusts him because he will deal with them to the best of his ability.  He has proved himself to be a tremendous social worker, dealing with a very emotive issue.</P>
      <P>I congratulate also Kerry County Manager, Mr. Martin Nolan, who has spearheaded a conciliation process between the settled and travelling communities in Tralee and throughout County Kerry.  The issue of traveller accommodation has historically been a highly controversial and contentious one.  In the past provision of traveller accommodation in the form of halting sites has led to tension between travellers and settled communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In early 1987 a similar situation developed in Tralee as the urban district council decided to make provision for the construction of a halting site for roadside travellers in the town.  Given the level of tension which developed, it was decided that a joint initiative between Tralee Urban Council and Kerry County Council would be <Col N="1093" /> undertaken.  The Kerry County Manager, Mr. Nolan, said it was in the interests of travellers and the settled community to develop a peaceful and productive living and working relationship and accordingly a strategy was put in place to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The strategy comprised the establishment of a consultative process.  The consultative process was undertaken by a liaison committee comprising all the elected members of Tralee Urban District Council, travellers and traveller representatives, members of residents committees, members of the business community and the partnership company.</P>
    <P>At present there are 213 traveller families living in County Kerry.  Some 164 are in standard housing, 23 in serviced halting sites and 26 on the roadside.  Accommodation of the latter families is the immediate concern of Kerry County Council and the urban district councils.  There is an immediate need for halting site accommodation to provide adequate accommodation and services for these families.  It has been the experience that the large majority of Kerry travellers want standard type housing rather than halting sites. However, given the number of families on the roadside there is an immediate need for halting site accommodation.  No halting site should be developed in a densely populated area, because it is accepted the settled community will object, and rightly so.  There are other areas where these halting sites should be developed.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that through the consultation which has been ongoing since September 1997 the various issues which not only affect accommodation but also all aspects of integration will be addressed.  Social integration and the development of a peaceful, productive living and working relationship is dependent on identification of all the issues of concern and the development of proposals to address these issues and to evaluate the impact of actions taken.</P>
    <P>The consultation process was set up as an inclusive measure for all the community to put forward their viewpoints for discussion and to adopt agreed measures which will enhance the understanding of each other's position.  The discussion which has been facilitated through the forum in the past six months has brought forward recommendations for a more integrated relationship between the traveller and settled communities. The consultation process has begun to break down perceptions and areas of misinformation and has informed and stimulated the participants in all the areas discussed.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the recommendations contained in the report, already presented to local authorities, will assist in providing a long-term positive environment for both communities living and working together.  It is fundamental that various points be taken into consideration when discussing the future of travellers, education and training courses, accommodation issues, health issues and crime and public order issues.  Consultation <Col N="1094" /> processes, if established throughout the country, will be successful in time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it well.  I hope it can be pursued by the various local authorities, including Kerry County Council.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill and will dwell briefly on the situation in Wexford.  From time to time we are told that all the travelling communities originated in Wexford.  That is not necessarily the case.  I listened today with great interest to Deputies from all sides sharing their concerns about travellers and at the same time talking about council injunctions to remove them from Westport, West Cork etc.  If there was more action in some of the other counties in relation to providing halting sites and housing for travellers it would be better than running them out.</P>
      <P>In Wexford there are a number of halting sites and housing units.  I am not in favour of halting sites but I am in favour of providing proper accommodation for travellers.  Under a pilot scheme three or four years ago, eight or ten houses were built in Enniscorthy and allocated to traveller families.  There are plans to construct another eight or ten houses in the coming year. Hopefully that will help to resolve some of the problem.  It is not easy to get the public to accept halting sites or houses for traveller families because of serious objections and, in some cases, a total lack of responsibility on the part of the traveller community.  It will have to be a two-way process in the areas of discipline and education and generally requesting travellers to keep their areas in a reasonable condition.</P>
      <P>A recent report on travellers' needs in the Wexford area was carried out by the Wexford area partnership.  It deals with a number of areas: site conditions, health, education, training, employment and many recommendations on how the issue could be resolved.  Parts of this report are frightening.  Some 41 per cent of the families surveyed had one or more members with a long-term illness or disability.  The traveller community do not consider that the health service is relevant to them.  Some 82 per cent of all families interviewed said the health board services were not suitable.  Filling up forms and dealing with those in the health board are problems.  I am pleased the South Eastern Health Board is trying to develop a regional policy on travellers' health. Some of the issues raised in the report, such as form filling, dealing with the difficult problem of identifying travellers and the overall health and care of travellers will be taken up by the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only 1 per cent of traveller children attend second level school whereas 70 per cent to 90 per <Col N="1095" /> cent attend primary school.  This is alarming and a matter that should be looked at by the Minister for Education and Science.  In this House we tend to deal with traveller accommodation which is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and local authorities. There is a need to broaden the whole area of dealing with travellers and to involve the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Education and Science, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the Minister for the Environment and Lodal Government to tackle the real problems faced by travellers.</P>
    <P>It is time we looked seriously at building houses for travellers.  Some people say they are a traveller community and have their own way of living.  However, in the Enniscorthy area the majority of families want to be housed.  We should move towards that option and away from unsightly halting sites.  The provision of a proper set of between eight and ten houses with a caretaker is a far better way to deal with this problem. In his response, the Minister might give his views on houses rather than on sites for travellers which cause serious problems with the general public.</P>
    <P>One could speak here for the next hour on the travellers and their needs, but I will conclude.  I ask the Minister to respond to some of the issues I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarianMcGennis" hpid="Ms M. McGennis Ms M. McGennis">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I welcome any legislation which advances the provision of accommodation for the travelling community. I have been a member of a local authority for 13 years and I have supported various plans within my local authority to provide accommodation for travellers throughout the county.  It is to our shame that I remember that in 1985 Dublin County Council, under the then chairman, Ray Burke, brought forward its plan for two five-family halting sites in every electoral ward of the county to deal with the problem.  We always refer to the provision of accommodation as a problem and it is a problem.  I know the travellers do not like to be referred to as a problem, but accommodation is certainly a major problem.  We would have dealt with the numbers of travellers in our administrative area under that plan within three or four years.</P>
      <P>One of the first functions I, as a new member of a local authority, was asked to perform was the opening of a halting site in my council ward.  I went simply on the invitation of the community affairs department, but no other councillors turned up and I was asked if I would like to perform the function.  I was absolutely delighted to do so.  I deemed it a great privilege and pleasure to be allowed to perform that function.  It says much about the mentality of local authority members, who would certainly turn up at any other function in their area and who would be delighted to wear the chain of office and preside at an opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> The record of my local authority, Dublin County Council, is patchy but it is certainly better than that of many local authorities.  At the time I was elected, the settlement programme simply amounted to the provision of serviced sites, and I use the term in the most unflattering way.  Serviced sites meant Portaloos and skips on green fields in the Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Clondalkin areas.  That was where travelling families were concentrated and that was where the council's responsibilities began and ended.  That was simply because there were green fields in those areas.  There were areas of land on which one could park caravans.  One might see it as at least a humanitarian response, but it was not a proper response to the needs of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies and the Minister referred to the fact that the huge majority of travelling families are housed in the Dublin region.  They are housed in extremely bad circumstances in the main.  However, there are very good halting sites throughout.  One, which is close to my home is in Porterstown near Blanchardstown, is a beautiful site which is well worth visiting.  The council used it on a number of occasions when it was proposing additional sites.  We brought people, groups, and councillors to see a good site so that it could be replicated and to reduce the fears and concerns of communities and local authority members.</P>
    <P>I believe that the local authority has an absolute responsibility to provide accommodation for all, that is the travelling community and the settled community, who cannot provide for themselves. In the past I have stated to various Ministers for the Environment &mdash; I remember stating this to Pádraig Flynn &mdash; that I believed sanctions should be imposed on local authorities which did not provide accommodation and did not live up to their responsibilities.  The proposal, which was not greeted warmly by my colleagues in Fianna Fáil because it was made at a party conference, involved part of a roads grant being taken from local authorities which did not live up to their responsibilities and which allowed families to live on the side of the roads in appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>Councillors must have backbone also.  I stood up at public meetings and defended the council's policy on the provision of halting sites and defended the proposals in my area to provide accommodation.  Other members of my party and members of other parties who took that stance will confirm that they did not lose a single vote as a result.  There are no votes to be gained but if one defends a basic human right, one will not lose a vote.  People may not agree but they will know that it is a principled decision.</P>

      <P>May I make two brief points?  I believe that the lifestyle of the travelling <Col N="1097" /> community is wrong.  It is extremely hard on women and children, and I would applaud the women and children who will avail of education and health opportunities.</P>
      <P>I think my final point has been raised already. The local authorities have 100 per cent funding for the provision of halting sites but they are loath to provide those halting sites when they are lumbered with the maintenance of them.  If the Minister wants to encourage, as well as propose sanctions on, local authorities, he must look seriously at providing 100 per cent or maybe 90 per cent finance for the maintenance of the sites.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I hope it will see travellers taken off the side of the road and given basic housing.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  I appreciate, in particular, the support expressed for the objectives of the Bill and the measures set out in it, and I have taken careful note of all the issues raised.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a clear demonstration of the commitment of the Government as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium to promote social inclusion.  The measures set out in the Bill will ensure that each local authority addresses the accommodation situation of travellers in a planned and co-ordinated manner within a defined timeframe.  It provides for consultation with travellers, other statutory and voluntary bodies and the public.  All local authorities will be required to adopt and implement five year programmes in parallel with each other.  These measures involve a change in policy from the approach adopted for many years.  For over 30 years we have relied on the exercise by local authorities of discretionary power with capital funding and encouragement from Government. While that approach has delivered almost 3,400 units of accommodation, there are still over 1,100 traveller families without any official accommodation. The measures proposed in the Bill are necessary if we are to meet the accommodation needs of these families and ensure that future needs are met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to respond to the issues and concerns the Deputies have raised in the course of this debate.  Some Deputies referred to the provision for consultation with the public and contrasted these with the provisions for consulting travellers. As I indicated in my opening remarks, there is a major emphasis on consultation throughout the Bill.  The Bill provides for consultation with the public in a number of ways.  There is provision for public input into the preparation of a draft five year accommodation programme.  A housing authority must make a copy of the draft programme available for inspection and publish a notice in a local newspaper advising the public that regard will be had to written representations made within two months of the date of the notice. Moreover, the manager will be required to submit <Col N="1098" /> to the members a report summarising any submissions received in response to the notice and indicating how these are to be taken into account in the draft programme.</P>
    <P>The public will also have an opportunity to comment on any variations to county or city development plans arising as a result of the proposed amendments to the Planning Acts in relation to the inclusion of objectives for the provision of accommodation for travellers in the development plans.  All proposals for development other than emergency works require the prior approval of the members of the authority. The public would have an opportunity to have an input through their local representatives prior to the development going ahead.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures set out in the Bill, the local government planning and development regulations have been amended to provide that proposals for halting sites to be developed by a local authority in its functional area be subject to the public notice provisions of Part X of the regulations with effect from 31 May 1998.</P>
    <P>The above measures are just minimum requirements. Under proposals for local government reform, strategic policy committees are to be established by local authorities for each of the major policy areas, including housing.  It is intended that these committees will be the main policy formulation centres.  There is provision for representation on them by sectional interests outside the local authority structures.</P>
    <P>Local authorities may also engage in other public information, awareness and consultative exercises without the express authority of legislation. Local authorities have engaged in successful public consultation exercises on specific issues and have developed a variety of arrangements to suit issues and local circumstances.  Members will agree that local authorities are in the best position to decide what is most appropriate.  I will be encouraging them to engage in such exercises when giving advice and guidelines on the implementation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the inclusion of other interests in the national and local accommodation consultative committees.  It was also suggested that the local committees should include representatives of the settled community. As regards the national committee, I am satisfied that the composition provided for in the Bill is appropriate.  The committee will bring together representatives from local authorities &mdash; both elected members and management officials &mdash; traveller organisations, my Department and a nominee of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has overall responsibility for monitoring the implementation of the wide range of recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.  In addition, there will be an independent chairperson and there is provision for the Minister to appoint two other persons with experience of and an interest in the welfare of travellers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the local committees, the <Col N="1099" /> members of local authorities who will form part of the membership of these committees are in the best position to represent the views of the wider community.  In deciding the composition of the local committees I must take account of several considerations, namely, the role of the committees, which is consultative in nature, decision-making remaining the responsibility of the housing authorities and, in particular, the focus of the committees on improving relations and understanding between local authorities and travellers.</P>
    <P>Given that a great deal of the work of the committees will involve consideration of matters in detail concerning the assessment of accommodation needs of travellers, the planning, design and management of proposals to meet these needs, the need to keep membership to manageable levels and the difficulties inherent in seeking to identify representatives of the settled community other than the elected representatives, I am satisfied that the composition provided for in the Bill is appropriate.  Moreover, provision has been made for public consultation under the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the respective roles of elected members and managers under the Bill.  In particular, I wish to respond to the suggestion that managers are being empowered to override elected members.  The adoption of the programme will be a reserved function and it must be adopted by resolution of the members of the authority.  If they fail to adopt the programme within the time allowed, the manager will be required to adopt it subject to any modifications which he or she considers necessary. Members will have ample opportunity to exercise their right to adopt a programme which fulfils their statutory obligations.  It is only if they fail to exercise their power that a manager will be required to intervene.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore suggested that in the event of a manager adopting a programme there should be an appeals mechanism.  The position is that individual proposals developed under the programme will be subject to the planning process which applies to local authorities' developments in their functional areas.  Moreover, programmes are subject to periodic review and elected members can initiate such a review.  I am also conscious of the implications of providing for additional steps in the adoption process for programmes, the need to minimise delays and the risk of litigation.</P>
    <P>I believe local authority members will take their responsibilities seriously and the measures in the Bill will help them to do so, even where there is strong or vocal opposition locally.  In particular, members will have the benefit of a thorough and structured consultation process which will ensure that all legitimate concerns can be considered before a programme is adopted.  They will also have the assurance that all local authorities approach traveller accommodation issues on the same basis and within the same timeframe. This is particularly significant as in the past the <Col N="1100" /> perception that other local authorities were not playing their part helped strengthen opposition to the provision of accommodation for travellers.</P>
    <P>In referring to the public notice provisions of part 10 of the planning regulations, Deputy Olivia Mitchell stated that the final decision rested with the manager.  I wish to correct this statement.  On completion of part 10 procedures, a report in respect of the proposed works must be submitted to the members of the authority.  Should members wish to prevent the authority continuing with a development, a resolution under section 4 of the City and County Managers (Amendment) Act, 1995, to that effect must be passed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin suggested that section 7 should have an additional subsection which clearly defines the content of an accommodation programme and stated that the inclusion of such a definition would enhance the overall understanding of the provisions of the Bill.  Section 10 already contains comprehensive provisions in respect of the format and content of accommodation programmes.  It sets out those matters which must be included in a programme, including information on the accommodation needs of travellers.  The programme must also include a statement of the authority's policy regarding how the accommodation needs are to be met, a strategy to secure implementation of the programme and specific measures across a range of options, which may include the direct provision and management of accommodation by housing authorities or assistance from such authorities to travellers or voluntary bodies for the provision or management by them of accommodation.</P>
    <P>In preparing programmes regard must be had to the accommodation needs which have been identified, including the need for transient halting sites and the family circumstances of travellers. There is also provision for directions to be given by the Minister on any further matters which should be included.  It is considered that these provisions adequately cover the contents of programmes to ensure they form a comprehensive, integrated and transparent response to the needs of travellers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that Deputies support the Bill, but I note that a number expressed concerns about its implementation.  I wish to confirm that it is intended to implement the Bill as soon as possible after enactment.  Preparations are proceeding to facilitate early enactment and the Department will provide advice and guidance to local authorities on their obligations under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of capital funding has never been a cause delay in implementing the proposals for accommodation.  Capital funding in the case of all Government expenditure is subject to the normal requirements of value for money and general budgetary constraints.  In respect of administrative and other resources, it should be noted that under proposals on funding of local government, additional funding will be made to local authorities early next year.</P>
    <P>The requirement to adopt and implement the <Col N="1101" /> local five year accommodation programmes is a statutory requirement on local authorities as distinct from the discretionary power which applied until now.  Local authorities must report annually on progress made in implementing the programmes. There is also provision in the Bill for regular reviews of the local five year programmes with flexibility to adjust programmes in light of developments.  The local consultative committees will also have an interest in monitoring progress in providing the accommodation required.  There is also a requirement to report annually on the activities of such committees.</P>
    <P>Implementation of accommodation programmes is a dynamic and transparent process. Programmes are not intended to be adopted and left on the shelf.  In the circumstances, I have no reason to believe that local authorities will fail to act on their statutory obligations without reasonable cause.  There is already provision under the local government code for action in the event of failure by local authorities to discharge their statutory functions.  These are circumstances which could delay implementation and which fall outside the control of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The successful provision of accommodation for travellers will remain dependent on the level of acceptance by or opposition from the public to such proposals.  The increased emphasis on consultation with the public should help to promote greater acceptance of individual proposals for development.  However, in the event of sustained opposition to the provision of accommodation, local authorities could experience considerable delays in implementing programmes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Currie was concerned about the enforceability of the one mile provision in section 31.  The main purpose of this provision is the protection of travellers who have been allocated proper accommodation and also residents in the immediate vicinity from an influx of other families seeking to be accommodated.  The one mile limit, with no obligation to provide alternative accommodation, was recommended in the Report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community. This is the only power in the Bill to deal with unauthorised encampments without a corresponding obligation to provide alternative appropriate accommodation.  As this represents a significant departure from the existing provisions of section 10 of the 1992 Act and the position that had been adopted by the courts in many cases, the Attorney General's advice was sought on this provision.  On the basis of that advice I am satisfied the one mile provision is reasonable in the circumstances stated at section C, paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 of the report.  A radius of one mile in compass is a significant area, especially in urban areas, and the protection offered is considerable. Depending on the distribution of size or other accommodation it could result in the exclusion of unauthorised encampments from a large area.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that local authorities assess the needs of travellers across a range of accommodation, including standard local authority <Col N="1102" /> housing, group housing, halting sites, grants for voluntary organisations and grants to individual travellers under the shared ownership scheme. Many points have been raised and I am sure Deputies will have the opportunity to consider them further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This is an interesting proposal. However, there is no need to increase the period of imprisonment from six to 12 months.  A period of imprisonment of six months in 1962 is no different in 1998.  There has been no depreciation in effect although there has been a depreciation in monetary values.  We discussed the monetary aspect on Committee Stage and we have changed the monetary values from 1962 to the present to reflect these changes.  However, in terms of a person's deprivation of liberty, six months in 1962 is the same as six months in 1998.  There is no need, therefore, to extend the time period from six to 12 months.</P>

    <Title>Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third Bill containing provisions relating to economic and monetary union and the changeover to the euro to come before the House this year.  The Central Bank Act, 1998, provided for the compatibility of Central Bank legislation with Articles 107 and 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, while the Finance Act, 1998, addressed taxation issues relating to the introduction of the euro.  As promised in the national changeover plan, the Bill is designed to provide for the other changes in monetary law and for other changes necessary for the introduction of the euro.  We consulted widely in the preparation of this Bill.  I wish to express my appreciation of all the organisations involved in the consultation, including those represented on the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, for their valuable contributions.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill, I will describe briefly the legal framework which has been set down at EU level for the use of the euro which forms the backdrop to the Bill.  Two EU regulations comprise the legal framework. The first, Council Regulation 1103/97 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro, was adopted by the Council on 17 June 1997.  This regulation provides for continuity of contracts and other legal instruments and for the technical rules, including rounding rules, for conversions between participating currencies and the euro.  It also provides that from 1 January 1999 the euro will replace the ECU at a rate of one to one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second regulation, Council Regulation 974/98 on the introduction of the euro, was formally adopted on 3 May 1998, although its text &mdash; apart from the names of the member states <Col N="1110" /> participating in EMU &mdash; had been settled for a considerable time before that.  It provides that from 1 January 1999 the euro will be the currency of the participating member states and sets out the rules governing the three year transitional period which begins on 1 January 1999 and ends on 31 December 2001.</P>
    <P>During the transitional period national currencies will continue to exist as subdivisions of the euro.  As euro notes and coins will not be available until 1 January 2002 all cash transactions will remain in national currency.  Until then the principle of &ldquo;no compulsion, no prohibition&rdquo; will apply, whereby economic agents will be free to use the euro but will not be compelled to do so.  During the transitional period, unless parties agree otherwise, contracts and other legal instruments denominated in national currency will continue to be performed in national currency, while those denominated in euros will be performed in euros.</P>
    <P>An important provision in the regulation relates to payments made by crediting an account. It provides that where a payment can be made by crediting an account a debtor may pay either in euros or in the national currency of the member state where the creditor has his account.  The payment must be credited by the financial institution to the account in the denomination of the account, that is, whether it is in the national currency or in euros.  Thus, payment in euros credited to an Irish pound account in Ireland will automatically be converted into Irish pounds and a payment in Irish pounds credited to a euro account in Ireland will be converted into euros.</P>
    <P>In addition, the regulation provides that member states may take measures for the redenomination of debt into euros and for the redenomination of the unit of account of organised markets, for example stock markets, and of payment systems.  The Bill contains measures relating to the redenomination of debt.</P>
    <P>The regulation also deals with the final changeover to the euro, which will take place from 1 January 2002.  From that date euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and will be legal tender across all the participating member states and references in contracts and legal instruments to participating currencies will be read as references to the euro at the relevant conversion rate. Thus, on 1 January 2002 the legal changeover will be complete and all Irish pound denominated bank accounts, laws and contracts will be read as if they were in euros according to the conversion rate.  However, the regulation provides that national currency notes and coins may remain legal tender for at most six months more, that is, up to 30 June 2002.  This period may be shortened by national law.</P>
    <P>The EU legal framework comprises the core monetary law of the euro area and the two regulations are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in Ireland.  However, some national legislation is necessary for the sake of clarity in national law and to avail of options in the legal <Col N="1111" /> framework and that is essentially the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Heads of the Bill circulated for consultation to interested parties last March presented a more extensive reflection of the terms of the EU legal framework than the Bill now contains. However, the European Monetary Institute, in its opinion on the heads of the Bill, expressed a legal concern about such an approach, given that EU regulations have direct effect in national law. Accordingly, the Bill now adopts a narrower approach, essentially declaring that by virtue of Council Regulation 974/98 from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State is the euro and the Irish pound is a subdivision of the euro.  The EMI's opinion accepted the need to refer in national legislation to the lawful currency of the State.</P>
    <P>The EMI's opinion also raised some other points which have been reflected in the Bill, notably with regard to two imperfections in Central Bank legislation which had been raised in the EMI legal convergence report in March and the desirability of a reference to the fact that DIBOR &mdash; the Dublin interbank offered rate &mdash; will be replaced by EURIBOR &mdash; the European interbank offered rate.  The opinion also offered some valuable drafting suggestions which have been taken on board.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the background to the Bill I will give an overview of its main provisions.  The Bill declares that by virtue of Council Regulation 974/98 from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State will be the euro and the Irish pound will be a subdivision of it.  The Bill removes incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the EU legal framework for the use of the euro.  It also recognises the role of the European Central Bank in the issue of notes and the volume of coins to be issued.  The Bill states that as of 1 January 1999 DIBOR will be replaced by EURIBOR.  It makes provision for the redenomination into euros of outstanding Government debt.</P>
    <P>In addition, at the request of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have included three provisions relating to the redenomination of company share capital into euros.  These provisions will facilitate companies which wish to redenominate their capital structure into euros before 1 January 2002.  Furthermore, the Bill contains two provisions to deal with the two imperfections identified by the European Monetary Institute, EMI, which I mentioned earlier.  Finally, the Bill provides for the design, issue and sale of commemorative legal tender coinage.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 4 contain standard provisions as regards short title and commencement, interpretation, expenses and the laying of regulations and orders before the Oireachtas.  I draw the attention of the House to an error in section 4, which refers on line 6 to &ldquo;an order under Section 2 or 15&rdquo;.  The reference should be to &ldquo;an order under Section 1 <Col N="1112" /> or 15&rdquo; and I intend to table an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage.  Section 5 defines terms used in the Bill.  It also provides that, unless the context requires otherwise, a word or expression in the Bill which is also used in Regulation 974/98 on the introduction of the euro will have the same meaning in the Bill as it has in the regulation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 makes an important declaration as regards the currency of the State.  It amends section 24 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which defines the Irish pound as the monetary unit of the State.  The section replaces that definition with a declaration that, by virtue of Regulation 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State is the euro and the Irish pound unit is a subdivision of the euro.  The section goes on to amend section 2 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, which states the Irish pound and penny are the only legal denominations of the currency of the State.  Obviously, from 1 January 1999 they will not be the only legal denominations of the currency of the State because the euro and the cent will also be legal denominations.</P>
    <P>Section 7 declares that contracts may be denominated in euro during the transitional period by virtue of Regulation 974/98, despite the fact that euro notes and coins will not be in circulation. This is necessary because section 25 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, provides only for contracts denominated either in legal tender or in a currency other than the currency of the State. During the transitional period the euro will not exist in legal tender form &mdash; because euro notes and coins will not be available &mdash; nor will it be a currency other than the currency of the State.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 14 of the Bill deal with legal tender and legal tender amounts, the provision and issue of euro coins and the costs and proceeds of such provision and issue.  Section 8 defines the term &ldquo;earlier operative date&rdquo;, which is used in Chapter III.  Section 9 gives the Minister for Finance power to set a date for the withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins.  As I already outlined, the legal framework allows member states to set a date between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2002 for the withdrawal of legal tender status.  It is too early yet to set a date for withdrawal of legal tender status, so the section gives the Minister power to withdraw that status by order.  A date before 30 June 2002 set by the Minister by order will be known as &ldquo;the earlier operative date&rdquo;.  The section also provides for the repeal of section 118(3) of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which provides for the continuing legal tender status of Irish pounds because Irish pounds will no longer be legal tender from 30 June 2002 or the earlier operative date set by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that no one, other than the Central Bank and persons designated by ministerial order, will be obliged to accept more than 50 euro coins in any single transaction.  This reflects a provision in the EU legal framework. The section also provides for the repeal, from the <Col N="1113" /> date of withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins, of the present rules about legal tender of coins.  These rules are contained in sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, and section 15 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1970.</P>
    <P>Section 11 empowers the Minister for Finance to provide euro coins and to set out by order their technical specifications.  These specifications must comply with the technical specifications which the EU Council of Ministers lays down under the Treaty on European Union, and, indeed, the Council has already adopted a regulation on the matter, Regulation 975/98.  The section also gives the Minister power to issue through the Central Bank coins provided under this section and confirms that issuance of such coins will be subject to the approval by the European Central Bank of the volume of issue, as required by Treaty as will issuance of commemorative coins provided under Part III of the Act.  The section also provides for the repeal of sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, which deal with the provision and issuance of Irish pound coins, with effect from the date of withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 12 is to extend to coins issued under this Bill and comparable coins issued by other member states participating in the euro area the prohibition on counterfeiting contained in the Decimal Currency Act, 1969. Sections 13 and 14 deal respectively with the costs of providing euro coins under section 11 and the proceeds of issuing such coins.  The cost will be charged to the general fund of the Central Bank and debited to the currency reserve, while the proceeds will be paid into the general fund and credited to the currency reserve.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 to 19 deal with the withdrawal of legal tender status from notes and coins.  In particular, they refer to the &ldquo;calling in&rdquo; and &ldquo;redemption&rdquo; of notes and coins.  The expression &ldquo;to call in&rdquo; means to demonetise or put out of currency, that is, to deprive of legal tender character.  In other words, a subdivision of a currency unit that is called in may no longer circulate or be used as money.  Redemption, on the other hand, involves the replacement of notes and coins which are worn out, defaced, or otherwise damaged, or which have become surplus to circulation requirements, by the issue of other coins or currency notes, or by crediting their face value against an account at the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 15 extends to coins issued under this Bill and to euro coins issued by other participating member states which will be legal tender in Ireland, the power already available to the Minister for Finance to call in Irish coins by order. The section limits the Minister's power by requiring the consent of the European Central Bank to any order relating to matters within its competence under Article 105a(2) of the Treaty.  This states &ldquo;Member States may issue coins subject to approval by the European Central Bank of the volume of the issue&rdquo;.  Section 16 extends the Central <Col N="1114" /> Bank of Ireland's existing power to redeem Irish coins to include coins issued under this Bill and euro coins issued by other participating member states which will be legal tender in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 17 extends the existing prohibition on melting down of coins to include coins issued under this Bill and euro coins issued by other participating member states which will be legal tender in Ireland.  Section 18 amends section 121 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which deals with the redemption of legal tender notes only, to provide that the Central Bank may continue to redeem Irish pound notes even after they have ceased to be legal tender.  Section 19 amends section 122 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to provide that the Central Bank must have the authority of the European Central Bank to call in notes.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 30 are a collection of miscellaneous sections.  The main provisions in them relate to the substitution of EURIBOR for DIBOR, redenomination of debt and company share capital.  Section 20 amends section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1963, to reflect the copyright of the European Central Bank in regard to euro notes and the copyright of the Minister for Finance in regard to the national face of euro coins issued under section 11.  As Deputies will be aware, euro coins will have a national face.  In our case the national face will show the twelve stars of the EU flag, the year, the harp and the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1963, protects the copyright of the Central Bank of Ireland in legal tender notes issued by it and the copyright of the Minister for Finance in coins issued under the Currency Act, 1927, and the Coinage Acts, 1926 and 1950.  In particular, it provides that some general exceptions to copyright, which are allowable under Part II of the Copyright Act, 1963, are not allowable in relation to such notes and coins. The Decimal Currency Act, 1969, as amended, extends the protection of copyright to coins issued under that Act.  It is now necessary to extend this protection to euro notes and coins.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that the issuing authority for statutory forms which contain references to sums in Irish pounds or are designed to accommodate references to such sums may change the forms or allow them to be changed to show also the corresponding amounts in euro or to accommodate references to sums in euro.  Section 22 states from 1 January 1999 the Dublin Interbank Offered Rate, DIBOR will be replaced by the European Interbank Offered Rate, EURIBOR. A statement to this effect has already been made in the National Changeover Plan.</P>
    <P>Section 23 governs the arrangements for the redenomination of tradeable debt instruments dueing the transitional period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001.  The section also contains certain provisions for facilitating the redenomination of the non-tradeable debt of State bodies.  All participating member states, including Ireland, have signalled their intentions to redenominate their &ldquo;own-currency&rdquo; tradeable debt <Col N="1115" /> instruments in the first week of 1999.  It is particularly important for Ireland to redenominate our domestic currency debt into the euro immediately this becomes feasible &mdash; as we will be a small issuer in a large euro bond market, we will need to ensure the liquidity and attractiveness of our bonds from the very outset in order to secure our place in that market.</P>
    <P>A critical factor in this is that the markets should be crystal clear as to how bonds, bills and Exchequer notes issued by me as Minister for Finance, or by the National Treasury Management Agency on my behalf, will be redenominated. As it would be inappropriate to use primary legislation to this end, I propose later this year to issue an order under section 23(1) which will set out the method of redenomination.  On the advice of the NTMA, I will be specifying what is called a &lsquo;bottom up&rsquo; method of redenomination, which is designed to redenominate the debt with the minimum of inconvenience to bondholders, the NTMA and the Central Bank. This method simply involves changing the denomination of each individual holding of a bond using the conversion rate, and issuing or withdrawing small amounts of that bond to ensure that the sum of the individual holdings of the bond will equal the euro value of the total Irish pound amount of the bond.</P>
    <P>Turning to Irish Government debt issued under the law of another participating member state and denominated in currencies to be replaced by the euro, the NTMA will be keeping under active review the practicality and desirability of redenominating this debt.  However, as it is largely either in bearer form or is not actively traded, I understand the NTMA has no current intention to redenominate it.  Nevertheless, if circumstances arise in which it might be necessary or desirable to redenominate this debt, provision is being made in section 23(2) for this possibility.  If at some stage it is decided to redenominate this debt, the Bill provides that the method used should comply with the law of the member state which governs the debt in question.  Moreover, the Minister for Finance will be obliged to give adequate notice of the proposed redenomination to the holders of such debt by means of a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> at least one month before the event.</P>
    <P>While it is not germane to this Bill, I put on record that the NTMA will not be changing the market conventions for outstanding Government paper, such as those governing how interest is calculated and how often it is paid.  Existing conventions will continue to apply.  However, the agency is exploring ways of enabling bondholders to switch out of existing bonds into bonds to which, for the most part, the conventions recommended by the market associations will apply.  As for new debt to be issued in euro, the agency will generally apply the conventions which the market associations have recommended.</P>
    <P>I am also providing in section 23(2) that, where <Col N="1116" /> other issuers of tradeable debt choose to use the method envisaged for redenominating Government debt, which I will set out in the order mentioned above, they will have the authority of law to do so unilaterally.  However, I emphasise that there is no compulsion on such issuers to use this method &mdash; they are perfectly free to use any other method of their choice but if they propose to do so they will have to observe the terms of the contract they have with bondholders.  In other words, it is only where they use the Government's method that they will have the authority of this subsection to redenominate their tradeable debt unilaterally.</P>
    <P>Section 23(3) has been included to facilitate the redenomination of the non-tradeable debt of State bodies.  What I am seeking to do here is to remove an administrative obstacle to such redenomination. In the normal course, if State bodies and their lenders wished to redenominate into euros any borrowing facility contracted between them, they would have to come back to the Minister who agreed the borrowing in the first place for approval to make any consequential change in the facility agreement.  In order to obviate this requirement and the administrative burden it would entail, I am proposing that ministerial consent to any such changes in facility agreements shall not be required.  However, to ensure this provision is not abused, I am providing that the waiver is subject to the limit on borrowings to which a Minister of the Government has already consented.  Section 23(3) contains a similar provision in relation to guarantees which the State has given in respect of the borrowing of State bodies.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 to 26, inclusive, of the Bill are included at the request of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They are designed to specify the manner in which redenomination of company share capital will be effected when, on 1 January 2002, references to national currencies in legal instruments are to be read as references to the euro at the conversion rate.  They also provide a mechanism whereby companies wishing to redenominate their share capital into euro during the transitional period will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>To effect redenomination or renominalisation during the transitional period, a company will have to have the necessary resolution passed by its shareholders.  The redenomination must occur at the level of the total share capital authorised or issued or at the level of the total class of share. The individual nominal share par value will then be determined by dividing the redenominated amount by the number of shares involved, and the nominal share par value will be expressed in an unrounded amount.</P>
    <P>It is likely that many companies will want to express their nominal share value in even euro amounts, and section 26 will facilitate such companies. The provision deals with situations where the renominalisation involves an increase in capital, as well as situations where it involves a <Col N="1117" /> decrease.  In the former case, use may be made of distributable reserves or the introduction of additional capital, while in the latter, an amount equal to any decrease in capital &mdash; which cannot amount to more than 10 per cent of the reduced capital &mdash; will have to be paid into a fund to be known as a capital conversion reserve fund.  In essence, where the renominalisation involves a decrease in nominal value, the actual total amount of the company's capital will remain unchanged, but will be expressed in different ways.  Provision for renominalisation in this way will be available during the transitional period and for an 18 month period after the end of the transitional period.  After that, companies which wish to adjust their capital will have to operate under the existing company law provisions.</P>
    <P>Turning to sections 27 and 28, I mentioned earlier that two legal imperfections were identified by the European Monetary Institute in its assessment of Ireland's legal convergence in March 1998.  I undertook to address these imperfections at an early date.  These two sections perform that task.  Section 27 amends section 134 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to confirm that the Minister for Finance's ability to suspend certain transactions in the national interest under that section will be without prejudice to the performance by the Central Bank of any function, duty or power required under the treaty or the statute of the European System of Central Banks, or ESCB.  Section 28 amends sections 10 and 13 of the Central Bank Act, 1997 to confirm that the requirement that the Minister for Finance's consent be obtained before the Central Bank refuses to approve the rules of a payment system or subsequently revokes such approval will not extend to the ESCB-related activities of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 29 is a general provision empowering the Minister for Finance to make regulations enabling Part II of the Bill to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Sections 30 to 34 provide for the design, issue and sale of commemorative legal tender coinage. Commemorative coins have been only a rare feature of Irish coinage over the years but the Bill codifies the practice which has been followed up to now in relation to the issuance of such coins when it has occurred.  I emphasise there is no specific intention to issue such a coin; the purpose of this part of the Bill is simply to provide a general power for such coins in Irish law.</P>
    <P>Turning to the specific provisions, section 30 empowers the Minister for Finance to provide coins of a commemorative nature and to put them on sale to the public through the Central Bank. Section 31 provides that the Central Bank shall determine the price at which any type of commemorative coin is put on sale, but must not determine a price below face value.  Section 32 provides that commemorative coins will be legal tender in the State, subject to the general limit on the number of coins that are legal tender for any single transaction.  Section 33 provides for meeting the cost of providing commemorative coins <Col N="1118" /> out of the general fund of the Central Bank and for paying into that fund the proceeds of issue of such coins.  Section 34 applies section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1963 to commemorative coins.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the timetable for the changeover to the euro.  Deputies will recall that at the beginning of May, EU Heads of State and Government confirmed that 11 member states, including Ireland, fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the euro.  Accordingly, on 1 January 1999 these 11 member states will form economic and monetary union or EMU, the euro will come into being and the exchange rates of the 11 participating member states will be irrevocably fixed against it.</P>
    <P>From 1 January 1999, the euro will be usable for cashless transactions &mdash; for example, cheques, direct debits and credit transfers &mdash; but euro notes and coins will not yet be available, so Irish pound notes and coins will continue in circulation. On 1 January 2002, euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and by 1 July 2002 at the latest, and probably a good deal earlier, Irish pound notes and coins will cease to be legal tender. The changeover to the euro will then be complete.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to describe briefly the practical preparations being made for the changeover to the euro.  As far back as 1995, my Department set up the Single Currency Officers Team, SCOT, which includes a representative from every Department.  In 1996 my Department established the Euro Changeover Group: it included representatives from ICTU, IBEC, the IFA and a wide range of business and professional associations, and its purpose was to help co-ordination of the changeover across the economy.</P>
    <P>Both SCOT and the Euro Changeover Group were involved in the preparation of the second edition of the national changeover plan, which I published last January.  The plan outlines the arrangements that will be made across the public sector, as well as by banks, building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange, to facilitate the changeover. I aim to publish a third edition of the plan in the run-up to the start of EMU on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>As regards information for business about the changeover, the EMU Business Awareness Campaign being run by Forfás has produced an excellent information pack, of which some 35,000 copies have been circulated.  The campaign has also circulated a summary leaflet in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, over 140,000 copies of which have been distributed.</P>
    <P>Forfás has also drawn up a short leaflet specifically for small and medium size enterprises and over 80,000 copies of this leaflet have been distributed. A document entitled What about Sterling: Actions for Companies was recently added to the Forfás information pack.  A survey of company awareness and preparedness was also launched recently.  A guide for retailers and a document on the information technology implications <Col N="1119" /> of the changeover will be added over coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Following the decision by EU Heads of State and Government that Ireland would be joining EMU from the start, on 5 May I established the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, ECBI.  The membership of the board draws on the organisations which had been represented on the Euro Changeover Group, while its chairperson and secretariat are provided by my Department.  The ECBI has two tasks: to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover and to provide public and consumer information.</P>
    <P>At the start of June I launched a public information campaign, which included a large scale advertising campaign over the first two weeks of June on radio and television and in the print media.  A leaflet setting out essential information on the changeover to the euro is being sent to all households.  In addition, a poster showing the euro notes and coins and the changeover timetable is being widely distributed.  A follow-up survey will be conducted to help shape the further development of the information programme.</P>
    <P>While much of it is necessarily somewhat technical, this Bill nevertheless represents an important third step, after the Central Bank Act, 1998, and the Finance Act, 1998, in our domestic legislative preparations for the introduction of the euro.  It marks a historic change in our monetary law by declaring that, by virtue of Council Regulation 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the euro is the currency of the State.  It will govern the arrangements for the redenomination of tradeable debt into euro during the transitional period.</P>
    <P>It will facilitate companies which wish to redenominate their share capital into euro during the transitional period.  It removes incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the EU legal framework for the euro.  Finally, it provides a general power for the provision of commemorative coins.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998, puts the last piece of the legislative jigsaw in place for Ireland's entry into EMU.  From 1 January 1999, the currency of the Irish Republic will be the euro and the countdown will have commenced for the final changeover to the euro in 2002, the circulation of euro coins and notes and the withdrawal of the Irish pound from circulation.  We are entering the twilight days of the Irish pound and the dawn of the euro.  The Bill, apart from its intrinsic merits, gives us an opportunity to reflect on where we <Col N="1120" /> are and to pause and look at where we are going with our ten euro companions.</P>
      <P>The main parties in this House are united in supporting Ireland's entry to EMU.  The rainbow Government made the principal arrangements and the final and detailed decisions are being put in place by this Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Despite the major impact the euro will have on economic affairs, it is as well to recall that the principal motivation for its establishment is political. The euro agenda has been driven forward by the Franco-German axis and is politically driven.</P>
      <P>The European Union cannot punch to its weight in the absence of a common currency.  The ongoing fight against inflation in Europe can only be won by the cohesion which enables a common currency to be established, and the cohesion which that common currency brings.  The influence of the European Union as a stabiliser of weak and emerging economies would always be discounted in the absence of a common currency. The euro will provide this stability when it becomes the second major reserve currency of the world.  It is difficult to believe the dynamic created by the euro will not continue and lead, step by step, to closer political links between member states, leading to a united Europe in the future.</P>
      <P>Many commentators who oppose EMU criticise it on the grounds that it is primarily a political initiative rather than an economic one.  This is to miss the point, as the enormity of the undertaking can only be fully understood in political terms and not simply in fiscal or economic terms.</P>
      <P>Security considerations are frequently at the heart of European decisions.  The founding fathers of the European Union had as their primary objective the ending of wars in western Europe by so inextricably linking the economies of western Europe that war would be unthinkable and impossible to conceive.  EMU is also driven by security considerations.  The binding together of Europe with a common currency links member states more closely than ever before.</P>
      <P>We should never forget our European history. Historically, Germany is a central European state.  Since 1945 we have seen it as a western European state but this is the historical exception, although in our conventional wisdom it is the central fact of European history in the second part of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>After the collapse of the USSR and the freeing of its satellite states in eastern Europe, Germany is once more free to revert to its historical role as the main central European power.  Its interest in expanding the European Union eastwards, and in assisting the growth of stable free market democratic countries on its eastern and southern borders are clear indications of its return to its historical position.  So, too, are the well recited fears of Germany in respect of the instability of the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What better way to ensure that Germany remains firmly positioned as the lead economy in <Col N="1121" /> the European Union than to exchange the mark for the euro and tie Germany inextricably into the west through a common currency?  Those who argue that the euro agenda and EMU are politically driven are right.  They should stand back and see the wider perspective and the history involved.</P>
    <P>Critics of EMU sometimes claim that European decision makers have been so fascinated by this political agenda that they have lost sight of simple economic fundamentals.  This is untrue. The preparations for the euro have been painstakingly thorough.  The convergence criteria have already yielded significant economic benefits for those member states which have achieved the targets, including Ireland.  The arrangements for the changeover are precise and follow a reasonable timetable.  The stability pact and the work of the European Central Bank should ensure the currency is underpinned by sound economics.</P>
    <P>Of course, everything will not go smoothly as we roll on to the best of all possible worlds &mdash; life is not like that.  Some of the difficulties are already apparent and some can been seen as through a glass darkly.  Our economy, no matter how successful, is small and open.  We are a very small boat bobbing on the international sea and our future prosperity depends to a very significant extent on the decisions of others.</P>
    <P>We owe a great deal to the German Government and people since we first joined the Community. Germany has frequently supported us at Council of Ministers level when negotiations were difficult.  It has also supported this country by generously transferring funds from the German taxpayer to Ireland through Structural and Cohesion Funds and the CAP.  Recently, however, we have seen the emergence of a more introspective Germany, a Germany reluctant to continue as the principal contributor to the European Union, a Germany more committed to pushing its own interests.  It would be a pity if at this juncture a less communitarian Germany were to lose its sense of mission as the driving force of Europe.  It would be a pity if the recent prosperity in Ireland were undercut by the eastward expansion of the community with its consequences for the common agricultural policy and the diminution in Structural and Cohesion Funds which would result.</P>
    <P>The position in the UK is also a matter for concern. The UK Presidency has achieved only moderate results, and the shambles which arose in selecting a governor for the European Central Bank must be laid at the feet of the UK Presidency.  I see no sign whatsoever that the United Kingdom will enter EMU in the foreseeable future.  The Bank of England is very much against entry and I do not believe the United Kingdom will enter EMU some time after the next British election as is generally expected.  This could prove quite difficult for Ireland.  A temporary absence from the euro by the United Kingdom is something we could probably cope with.  Its absence for a generation will cause us some grief.  The best that can <Col N="1122" /> be hoped is that the UK will establish at an early date a fixed exchange rate with the euro at a level compatible with our interests and that the subsequent fluctuations will be manageable. However, it is worrying.  I believe the conventional wisdom about early entry of the United Kingdom to the euro is wrong and that the thinking in the Bank of England at every level is anti-euro and very pro-sterling, and that is supported by patriotic and nationalistic sentiment particularly in England.</P>
    <P>Ireland was never better positioned for EMU entry than it is now, but we do have difficulties. The Government is no longer in control of monetary or interest rate policy.  Decisions will be taken at European level which will not suit us. There are signs of overheating in the economy. The last thing the economy needs now is a cut in interest rates, but that is what is going to happen before the end of the year.  Interest rates in Ireland will come down by at least 2 per cent.  We are at a different point of the economic cycle than our bigger European partners and the reduction in interest rates will be the first example of a European-led policy which is not really in our interests.</P>
    <P>It is also quite clear that the European Central Bank and the Commission intend exercising significant influence, if not direct control, over fiscal policy.  Already the talking has been fairly direct, as the Minister for Finance knows.  This straight talking will continue.  The European Central bank will report on a quarterly basis on the appropriateness of the fiscal policies being pursued by member states.  The Commission will invoke the stability pact if it is considered necessary.  The first task of the Minister for Finance will be to introduce the next budget.  The Minister's first budget was a bad budget, unfair, unimaginative and inflationary.  As far as our European colleagues are concerned, the Government is on probation. Our European colleagues intend watching this Government closely and scrutinising the fiscal policy it will bring forward.  We have already seen that over the past few weeks.  It would be a tragedy if, in our year of entry, Government fiscal policy were to run foul of the European Central Bank.  This country needs continuing stable, sustainable economic growth.  We can achieve such growth, but we should take all necessary steps to ensure that the Government, not the European Central Bank or the Commission, continues to decide how the fruits of that growth will be used.</P>
    <P>The fiscal gun must be loaded by running a budget surplus for the next few years.  Social partnership must be deepened and arrangements at the disposal of the social partners must be more flexible.  The economy must become more competitive, monopolies and cartels of all sorts must be ended, and the reform of the State sector, by its further involvement in the free market, must continue and must be led by the Minister for Finance. The lesson of history is that the only constant is change.  Bad times will come again.  When they do I hope the decisions taken in this House <Col N="1123" /> and by this Government over the next few years will arm the Government which presides over the downturn with the necessary policy levers to ensure a soft landing.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to some of the provisions of the Bill.  I thank the Minister for explaining everything so fully.  There are a number of points which he might take up in his reply later for our benefit. The Minister has said that from 1 January next cashless transactions may be conducted in euro even though no euro coins or notes will be in circulation. He mentioned in particular the settlement of accounts by cheque.  He did not mention credit card transactions.  Will it be possible from 1 January next to buy a holiday in Austria on one's credit card in euro and will it be possible in the course of that holiday in Austria to settle all bills with the same credit card in euro?  At what point will it be a requirement under law for dual pricing to be available to the consumer who wishes to purchase goods and services in euro and to settle the account in euro rather than in cash?</P>
    <P>I will come back to the national debt on Committee Stage and try to understand the arrangements the Minister is putting in place in respect of tradeable bonds and moving from an Irish bond market to trading in euro bonds and the advice from the National Treasury Management Agency to which the Minister refers.  The question I am asking now relates to the national debt.  Our debt is classified as domestic and foreign.  Borrowings in German marks would be on the foreign side of the balance sheet.  When we redenominate all Irish pound debt and other euro debt in euro, will it follow that what was previously foreign debt denominated in the currency of member states of the European Union will now become domestic debt?  The exchange rate risk will be taken out of it, but will there not be a fundamental change in the balance sheet?  Will there not be an increase in what we would have previously described as domestic debt?  If debt is welcome at all, would it not be more welcome that it should be domestic rather than foreign?  Would that not put a better cast at least on the fundamentals of our borrowing? I would like the Minister to give us information on what we can expect in that area.  I do not recall, and I have not checked, what the composition of our foreign debt is or whether a significant proportion of it is denominated in currencies of member states or not.  I would like the Minister to provide that information.</P>
    <P>Arising from the provisions on the renomination of shares, will this be discretionary within certain limits for companies?  Quite clearly companies would wish to have the nominal value of their shares quoted in convenient amounts of euro.  The Minister is providing under section 26 that this may be done.  I would like him to explain the parameters within which a company may operate.  In the Minister's speech or in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, there was a reference to 10 per cent.  I cannot see why that level of discretion would be necessary in the <Col N="1124" /> rounding up or down of nominal amounts of shares.</P>
    <P>This leads me to a primary question which arises from section 26.  In respect of prices, the Minister will be aware that it is common practice for marketing purposes to set prices which catch the eye of the consumer, for example, 19/11d or £99 &mdash; £99 is not £100, so it is a good marketing tool when putting a price on something.  In market-led pricing, once it is translated into euro it loses its effect.  There will be the temptation to round up the actual price which has been converted to the next market advantageous price for presentational purposes.  It is analogous to what the Minister said about the shares.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the Minister will deal with that? How does he intend to address the fear in the heart of every consumer that retailers and wholesalers will use conversion as an opportunity to raise prices?  A former Taoiseach under whom I served, Garrett FitzGerald, has written at length about the fact that there was not a rip-off at the time of decimalisation.  I believe that is the case but I cannot convince my constituents of that. Everybody I meet believes that prices increased significantly at the time of decimalisation.  Those people have the same fear now and a major public relations initiative is necessary to ensure that the transfer to the euro is not destroyed by an expectation or a belief that it will be used as an opportunity for raising prices.</P>
    <P>In respect of the changeover arrangements, I did not know it was the Minister's intention to introduce a concept in the Bill which is new to me.  I understood the changeover would take place between 1 January and 30 June 2002.  The Minister is now exercising a power where, by regulation, he can initiate the changeover any time after 1 January 2002 and not later than 30 June.  Is it the Minister's intention that the changeover should take place over a much shorter period than six months?  Is it his intention that the large supermarkets, which take in and give out a large amount of cash every week, will be used? Will the resources of the large retail chains be used as a type of quick exchange where Irish coinage and notes are taken in and the change is given out in euros?  Will the Minister indicate his thinking on that?  There must be some background to his decision that he can regulate for a much earlier changeover period than 30 June.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister described the national face of the Irish euro coins.  Will there be a national face on the notes or will they be standard?  Fine Gael will support this legislation. We will make additional comments on Committee Stage and seek explanations on behalf of ourselves and our constituents rather than opposing anything contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Perry.  I welcome the progress we have made.  We are now reaching the ideal of the founder members of the European Economic Community. The fact that we are to have a single currency <Col N="1125" /> consolidates the community, makes us more homogeneous and will facilitate trade and the tourism industry.  Overall, it will strengthen the union among the various member states.</P>
      <P>A factor that has emerged &mdash; perhaps the Minister has come across this in his dealings with the large number of US senators, congressmen and other groups coming here &mdash; is that we will be the only English-speaking country in the EMU.  That will give us a considerable competitive advantage in regard to attracting American industry to Ireland.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Ireland regards itself as being in the main EMU group of countries, with Germany, France, the three Benelux countries and Austria, in terms of the Maastricht convergence criteria, but we have a specific problem due to the relationship with sterling.  I raise this matter because of the concern of many people who depend on exports to Great Britain for their survival.  The fact that we share a common border with the UK will add to the problem.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Ireland's economic dependence on the UK has been reduced significantly over the past 20 years, the financial markets are not too convinced and regard the Irish pound as a quasi-sterling rather than a quasi-EMU currency. The fact that we are joining EMU without the UK will affect the relationship with sterling which the financial markets currently regard as strong, despite the hiccups announced today.  That is the general impression.  If the Bank of England is forced to raise interest rates it will subsequently strengthen sterling.  These are the types of fluctuations we will have to face in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>While the UK now accounts for just 26 per cent of Irish exports and 35 per cent of its imports, it remains our biggest single trading partner.  It represents the main competitor on third markets and is also a major competitor for Irish producers on the domestic market.  In addition, those industries most exposed to the UK tend to be highly labour intensive and operate on tight margins. Consequently, it is important to maintain a competitive rate against sterling, as Deputy Noonan pointed out.  This cannot be guaranteed when we join EMU without the UK, and it gives rise for concern.</P>
      <P>Irish companies will potentially be exposed to wide swings against sterling.  Since the formal link was broken in 1979, the sterling-Irish pound rate has fluctuated between 75p and 110p.  While such wide swings are unlikely, particularly given the changed political complexion of the UK, the Irish economy would need to be extremely flexible to cope with such swings if the worst happens.  This is particularly true in regard to fiscal policy and wage setting behaviour.  In fairness to the Minister, he has pointed that out on a number of occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that we should run a budget surplus at this strong stage of our economic cycle to enable the country to react with some fiscal help in the event of a sharp sterling movement in a post EMU world while staying within the stability <Col N="1126" /> pact guidelines.  Wage flexibility is also important, otherwise employment would have to take the brunt of any future adjustment process.  These considerations give rise to concern and we should not lose sight of them.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the various initiatives in regard to public information, which should continue.  The awareness campaign launched by the Minister on 1 June has not had a significant impact.  The managers of a large number of small to medium size industries have not yet concerned themselves with the changeover and seem to be indifferent to it in many instances.  The message must be gradually reinforced.  From an exporters point of view, I welcome the document produced by Forfás on actions for companies dealing with sterling.  A strong company awareness campaign must be in place between now and the year 2002.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time with me.  Economic and monetary union is one of the most significant business, economic and social changes to take place throughout Europe since Ireland joined the European Union in 1973.  It will have an impact on virtually every business.  The Government's role in the coming months will be to help Irish business.  The commercial impact will vary from business to business depending on the industry, products sold and the type of customer involved.  Areas that will need much help are marketing, sales and distribution, product development, purchasing, accounting and finance, information technology and human resources as well as the legal involvement.</P>
      <P>On the business awareness campaign, the Minister said that 35,000 leaflets have been circulated, but that is inadequate.  While big companies may have the personnel to deal with the changeover, small companies who find it difficult to survive will be unable to find the resources to cope with integration.  In regard to the changeover and computer technology, the Minister should provide a fund for small companies, perhaps through an accountancy firm that would bring together a group of retailers within an area and explain EMU.  It is not sufficient for Forfás to issue 140,000 leaflets because many of those publications are not read.  An awareness campaign should be put in place in each county to inform business people of the issue.</P>
      <P>People are fearful of the changeover.  The greatest fear is the role that will be played by banks.  At present people are fearful of bank charges, particularly retailers.  While there will be no coins or notes for a two year period, there is also a fear of paper transactions.  The business world, particularly in the area of imports, will be at the coalface of the changeover.  It has been suggested that the inflation rate will increase to 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a retailer, I am aware that prices of products from British-based warehouses have increased.  I appeal to the Minister to support retailers in the difficult period leading up to the changeover and <Col N="1127" /> reassure them there is nothing to fear from EMU. We must concentrate on the awareness campaign in the coming months.  I appeal to the Minister to consult with the Minister for Education and Science to promote awareness through schools. With the changes in 1971 inflation increased dramatically and people are fearful that the same will happen on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is by no means the first opportunity we have had in recent weeks to discuss this issue.  I will focus on two developments that have taken place since the May weekend decision, first, the appointment of the managerial team within the European Central Bank and, second, the drawing up and publication of the broad economic guidelines agreed by the Commission and member states.  I said previously and I repeat I am concerned about the nature of the Central Bank and the structure that has been created.  It is extremely important the Central Bank is accountable as well as independent. There must be political input into the activities of the Central Bank which make it accountable to the politicians of Europe and specifically the politicians of participating states.  I am sure the Minister will agree, as it is currently configured, the ECOFIN Council is scarcely capable of doing that.  On that council individual member states plead their own interests and seek compromise. It is possible the euro eleven will provide that input, but at this stage it is too early to say.  The Minister attended the first meeting of that committee a few weeks ago and I will watch with interest how it develops in the coming months and years.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have a say in the way the Central Bank does its business because it will make incredibly important decisions.  It is expected that interest rates will fall between now and the end of the year.  The European Central Bank will soon decide the initial interest rate that will apply throughout participating states and it is important that we and like-minded countries at the same point of the economic cycle have a say in that crucial decision.  Ireland, Spain, Finland and perhaps Italy, which comprise not more than 30 per cent of the total economy of the euro zone, are the peripheral economies.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that from the start we make it clear that decisions taken by the Central Bank cannot be governed exclusively by the interests of the core economies, France and Germany. It is important that there is a person at the most senior level in the Central Bank arguing the case for Ireland and like-minded states, for balance and making decisions not purely according to the interests of France and Germany.  If all decisions, particularly initial decisions, are made according to the interests of the core economies, support for the euro and the European project generally in countries such as Ireland will diminish rapidly because people will realise decisions are not taken in their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> In that context &mdash; I do not wish to use excessive language because that is not my style &mdash; it is extremely disappointing we did not succeed in getting a senior Irish person into one of the 23 managerial positions in the Central Bank.  We knew it was a long shot to get somebody on to the executive board, with only six positions &mdash; we did not make much of an effort in that regard &mdash; but not to succeed in getting any of the director general or sub-director general positions is unbelievable. The explanation by the Taoiseach and the Minister that nobody seemed to be interested is not good enough.  We need a person in the Central Bank who articulates Irish interests and the interests of like-minded states, and I hope we have not missed that opportunity.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that countries that will not participate from the outset such as Denmark and Britain succeeded in getting such positions.  Given the lobbying done by Italy and Spain to specifically create the deputy director general position, it is incredible that political pressure was not brought to bear by the Minister, the Taoiseach or the governor of the Central Bank to ensure one of those positions was given to an Irish person. If the argument was that nobody in Ireland was interested, the Minister should have engaged in arm twisting because we cannot afford to be without that important level of influence.</P>
    <P>The Commission, the monetary committee and ECOFIN have recently agreed the broad economic guidelines that will govern economic policy.  I put down a parliamentary question on this issue a few months ago and the response seemed to suggest that I should not be asking such questions, that these are routine matters, broad economic principles are agreed, that has been the practice for years and it does not really matter.  The reality, however, is different.  These broad economic guidelines are becoming much more country specific.  We are being told, not asked, by the Commission, the monetary committee and ECOFIN how we should run our national budget.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Student Nurses: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Shatter on Tuesday, 16 June 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls upon the Government and the Minister for Health and Children to bring forward a package of improved financial support for student nurses which will allow them to undertake their courses in nursing in a proper educational context without undue strain, stress and financial hardship and, more particularly, calls on the Government to provide a weekly non-means tested grant of £75 per week to student nurses; free meals for the duration of their three year programme <Col N="1129" /> whether in the designated base hospital or whilst undertaking an external clinical placement or academic studies; full payment to meet the expenditure incurred in the new fourth year degree programme and full reimbursement of the cost of any second temporary accommodation required by student nurses when undertaking external clinical placements away from the base hospital; and further calls on the Government to acknowledge that student nurses are not in a position similar to other third level students as they have a 48 week year working commitment at 35 hours each week and are, as a consequence, unable to take up any part-time employment from which they can generate any meaningful income without undermining their study programme.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann acknowledges and endorses the measures being taken by the Minister for Health and Children to ease the financial and other burdens on student nurses participating in the nursing registration/diploma programmes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for Health and Children).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.</P>
      <P>This debate follows a series of actions by student nurses across the country who are determined to highlight their plight.  Student nurses have been forced to engage in lunchtime work stoppages and protest marches to Dáil Éireann to ensure their voices are heard.  I and my Labour Party colleagues fully support their campaign.</P>
      <P>The conditions student nurses are expected to endure for three years are appalling and must be addressed by the Government as a matter of urgency.  Recent figures show a significant fall off in the number of students enrolling in nursing courses.  This is a serious development and comes at a time when hospitals and health boards are experiencing a severe shortage in trained nursing staff.  My colleague, Deputy Shortall, highlighted the fact that Irish hospitals are advertising for nurses as far away as Finland and Iceland in an attempt to recruit much needed staff.  Matrons in Kildare hospitals gladly welcome nurses who return from abroad.  This is a very serious issue for our health service and the Minister must tackle it immediately.  If he does not heed the warning signs a crisis of major proportions in our hospitals will occur in the not too distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conditions and grant assistance available to student nurses are a significant bar to young people deciding to pursue a career in nursing. Given the recent upturn in our economic performance, many school leavers have a wide variety of career options available to them when they complete secondary education.  The Minister must ensure that nursing remains an attractive <Col N="1130" /> option for a significant number of these school leavers.  If he is intent on standing over the current level of support afforded to student nurses, the numbers entering the nursing profession will continue to fall.</P>
    <P>Student nurses currently receive a grant of £3,000 per annum, which works out at £57.69 per week.  This sum is totally inadequate to support a student nurse and must be increased.  The majority of these nurses have to rely on parental handouts to make ends meet during their three year courses.  This places enormous pressure on parents and a strain on the family budget.  It also demeans the role of student nurses and prevents them from developing independent lifestyles.</P>
    <P>The current level of maintenance grant also prevents many people from embarking on a career in nursing.  This is particularly true of people whose parents are in receipt of social welfare payments.  Such families cannot be expected to subvent their child's nursing career for three years.  As a result many young people do not pursue their ambition to make a real contribution to our health services because of the severe financial pressure it would place on their families.  This is an extremely serious issue and the current grant levels discriminate against families on low incomes or those on social welfare.  This copperfastens the cycle of poverty which thousands of families in this State have to endure.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot defend the current level of support for nurses by comparing them with other third level students.  Student nurses form a distinct and separate body of students unlike any other in the country.  They work a 35 hour week for 48 weeks of the year.  This workload is probably unique within our third level system and prevents them from taking part-time employment to supplement their incomes.  For this reason, and the other issues raised by speakers during the debate, it is obvious that student nurses form a special group within our third level system.  It is only right and proper that they should receive support different from that afforded to other students in our third level system.</P>
    <P>The demands outlined by the Irish Nurses Organisation are reasonable and fair.  If they were implemented in full they would significantly improve the standard of living for thousands of student nurses across the country.  Student nurses are demanding a £900 per annum increase in their maintenance grant.  This is equivalent to a weekly rate of £75.  Many speakers alluded to the fact that this rate of financial support is roughly equivalent to the basic payment for people on unemployment benefit or community employment schemes.  It is a very modest sum of money on which to expect people to live.</P>
    <P>There are no real budgetary or fiscal reasons for denying this increase to student nurses.  Given our current buoyant level of Exchequer returns, the money is available in the Department of Finance. The investment of this money would have no significant inflationary effect on our economy. In short, there is no reason this increase should <Col N="1131" /> not be granted.  It is only a matter of political will. I am disappointed the Government lacks the political will necessary to grant this modest increase.</P>
    <P>The other demands of the lNO, as outlined in the motion before us, should also be granted as a matter of urgency.  Individually, the demands are extremely reasonable and would not create any significant problems for the Departments of Health and Children or Education and Science. However, if the demands were taken as a package, they would represent a significant enhancement of the conditions of student nurses.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the debate this evening is the question of the priority that we attach to our health service.  Our current strong economic performance provides us with resources to invest in social services that have suffered from years of neglect.  However, it is important to realise that these extra resources are not infinite and must be targeted at those areas that we, as politicians, decide are most in need of support.  In my opinion the relatively small investment required to dramatically change the living standards of student nurses is one of the most important investments we as a society can make.  It would achieve a number of results.  It would ensure fair play and just reward for a section of our community that has been neglected for too long.  It would remove the financial hardship that many families of student nurses currently endure as they supplement their children during their pre-registration courses.  It would remove the financial barrier that currently prevents children from disadvantaged backgrounds from embarking on a career in nursing.  It would also ensure that nursing remains an attractive career for thousands of people.  The implementation of the package of measures before us would send out the strong message that we value the health care system and are prepared to invest in the people who work in it.</P>
    <P>The motion has the full support of the Labour Party.  It addresses the modest demands articulated by the lNo. The Government has the resources to deliver on these demands and it is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to secure the necessary funding from his colleague in the Department of Finance.  Student nurses, and the entire health care system, deserve a Minister who is prepared to battle on their behalf.  The Government's amendment to the motion tonight indicates that the Minister cannot face this challenge.  Regardless of how much he attempts to excuse his record on this issue, the demands of the student nurses will not go away and he must face up to his responsibility at some time.  I urge him to do so sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>The new nursing registration diploma programme for student nurses which leads to registration with An Bord Altranais and the award of diplomas in nursing from a third level institution represents a significant advance in career registration, education and training. While there have been teething problems, we must not lose sight of the fact that pre-registration education of nurses is firmly established as a higher education programme which leads to an award of a third level qualification as well as registration with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>Students undertaking the new diploma programme have the status of third level students for the three year duration of the programme.  It is important to bear in mind that while they are not employees and are not paid a salary, they receive a generous package of financial and other supports. This package is in the region of £6,000, its largest component being an annual maintenance grant of £3,000.  It is important to note that, unlike other third level grants, the grant is not subject to a means test.  That the grant is almost double the level of the maximum grant payable to other third level students and is not means tested is recognition of the greater time commitment students of nursing are required to give to this programme. The provision of free meals, books and uniform allowances and the payment of students' third level fees are also designed to ease the burden on students.</P>
      <P>While the nursing registration diploma programme has greatly enhanced the education and training of student nurses, great care was taken in the development of the revised model to preserve the best elements of the traditional model of training.  The former apprenticeship model has served the health services well.  Nurses trained under that system have justifiably earned a reputation for the quality of care they provide to patients.  This is clearly evident from the huge demand for the services of Irish trained nurses in health care services around the world.  It is important to emphasise that the changes in pre-registration nursing education will build on the traditional method and strengthen the system.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for Health and Children for the significant steps he has taken to ease the financial difficulties experienced by young nurses.  We should recognise that by increasing the annual maintenance grant by 20 per cent and introducing a new external clinical placement allowance, the Minister has clearly demonstrated his commitment to addressing this problem.  This is in sharp contrast to the lack of concern shown by the previous Government.  The previous Minister for Health did not provide any increase for students during his term of office.  When the grant was introduced in 1994 it was pitched at £2,500 per annum and remained at this level throughout the term of the previous Government.  During that period student nurses did not benefit from the modest annual cost of living increases that were applied to third level grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the record against which the Minister's <Col N="1133" /> actions must be judged.  Within months of taking up office, he moved decisively to bring about a substantial improvement in the funding arrangements. In a single step, he increased the nursing grants by £500.  This 20 per cent increase represents a higher increase than the cumulative increases applied to other third level grants since 1994.  It should also be noted that the Minister addressed the financial difficulties students faced while undertaking external clinical placements away from their normal base.  I warmly welcome his initiative in introducing an external clinical placement allowance and weekly travel passes. These measures are designed to address issues which have existed since before the Government came into office.  It is disappointing that the Opposition is finding it difficult to acknowledge the real and substantial efforts made by the Minister within a short time to ease the burden on student nurses on diploma courses.</P>

      <P>I have gone through the record and I have not found one instance where the previous Minister supported the nurses' case.</P>
      <P>Nobody can doubt the Minister's commitment to enhance and develop the education and training of the nursing profession.  This is reflected in the substantial additional funding he secured this year for the pre-registration nursing diploma course and the continuing education and professional development of registered nurses.  An additional sum of almost £11 million has been provided for the diploma programme, bringing to £24 million the amount that will be spent on the programme in 1998.  The availability of this funding ensures that the completion of the transition from the traditional apprenticeship model of training to the diploma based programme will be achieved in all three pre-registration nursing disciplines this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also recognises the importance of continuing education to the professional development of nurses generally.  An additional £1.5 million has been provided this year, bringing to almost £7 million the total spending in 1998 on initiatives designed to augment the knowledge and skills of practising nurses and advance professional competence.  The scale of this investment in both pre and post-registration nursing education and training is tangible evidence of the Minister's commitment to ensure that the nursing profession is enabled to acquire the skills and competence required to meet the new challenges in an increasingly complex and constantly changing <Col N="1134" /> health care system.  I support the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Government and I, as a member of the Government party, recognise the full extent of the courses undertaken by student nurses and the accompanying pressure and stress associated with such intense study.  The steps the Government has taken to increase the grants by 20 per cent, to provide special payments to students on clinical placements who must find new accommodation, to provide transport passes in special circumstances and to deal with issues relating to books and uniforms must be welcomed. These measures will help to improve the overall lot of student nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's interest in streamlining the exam structure and his acknowledgement that two sets of examinations, one by third level colleges and the other by An Bord Altranais, is a significant source of pressure and stress for these students.  I hope the new exam arrangements will recognise the source of this pressure and stress <Col N="1135" /> and that An Bord Altranais will publish a positive report which recommends substantial changes in this area.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister's efforts in providing substantial moneys in this year's Estimates to ensure the development of this course and to support student nurses.  We must ensure that funding is made available to student nurses so that they are given every opportunity to study and that their educational needs are continuously upgraded in terms of the technology available to them to allow them to do their job.</P>

      <P>We must all recognise the major advances in nurses' training in recent years. Nurses will now be able to take a recognised diploma which is classified as third level education. They can also take an optional degree course in their fourth year which was not available previously. This is a change from the old apprenticeship system where trainee nurses worked in hospitals and were on the payroll.  Trainee nurses are now treated like third level students who want to be educated and gain practical experience.  In that context, the Government package of £6,000 to support trainee nurses on an annual basis is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.  I would like if it was more but the Minister has been generous in increasing maintenance grants by 20 per cent.  Although he has been in office for only a year it is an outstanding achievement.</P>
      <P>The nursing profession is a caring one and the most important aspect is the nurse patient relationship which we must try to improve.  Nursing, like medicine, has changed totally over the years.  Technology and science have revolutionised medicine and the operation of hospitals. Education is the key to the future.  We must allow students and trainee nurses to carry out their activities as full-time students without working in hospitals.</P>

      <P>I should say in passing &mdash; and everybody in Laoighis will understand what I am talking about &mdash; that I had recourse to visit Beaumont Hospital earlier this morning.  I was struck by the high levels of technology and equipment.  The nurses and the caring profession should be commended and encouraged to pursue diploma and degree courses in the future.</P>

      <P>Having been involved in argument with the former Minister and Minister of State for approximately two years for the introduction of the course in the Cork and Kerry region and in the Southern Health Board, I put up with the excuses that the finance was not available, that improvements would have to be phased in, that it was a total change, costly and would take some time to introduce.</P>
      <P>I came to Dublin as chairman of the Southern Health Board to campaign for that programme. It took us a long time.  I was told at all times it depended on the funding available.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties were conscious of the need to fund programmes and to raise funding.  I ask those parties to be consistent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes and in doing so I pay tribute to Dr. Geraldine McCarthy, with whom I served on the Southern Health Board.  She was the nurses' representative who later qualified and did a doctorate in America.  She is now one of the main architects of the new programme.</P>
      <P>At all times Geraldine McCarthy considered that the nursing staff had much more to contribute but were not permitted to do so, that the status gap between doctors and nurses was too great and the area of responsibility was not being extended.  The ability of trained nurses was not being tapped and it was considered that changes had to be made.  The diploma based programme is the foundation for the change.  Those of us who felt there should be a greater role for the nursing profession were told for a number of years that there could be legal difficulties if things went wrong.  That matter has now been rectified.</P>
      <P>It is a new programme and a new approach and will have to be monitored and evaluated.  I appeal to those in Opposition who shouted a few minutes ago to remember they have been out of office for only 12 months and that they had the opportunity for three and half years to put this matter on a firm foundation.</P>

      <P>The programme will have to be monitored and reviewed.  As with all other projects, changes will be required.  However, I can evaluate on a percentage basis the work done by the Minister, Deputy Cowen.  His approach is much more beneficial to the people involved than the previous approach.  I am not being too critical of the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Currie, on their approach.  Aspects of this motion are narrowly based.  Given what is happening, particularly with the nursing profession, radical changes will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a shortage of nurses because of the emergence of private nursing homes and that apprentices are not allowed on to the hospital <Col N="1138" /> floor.  These are all aspects of the scheme that have to be examined on a broader footing.</P>
    <P>We are moving forward at a time when we are beginning to recognise the real value of the people who have put in the time.  I have spoken at many graduation ceremonies for nurses.  It is only at these ceremonies that one realises the amount of time that has gone into training these people.  I would not like to hear arguments about £20 or £25 per week or whatever, nurses are entitled to much greater recognition than that.  A proper system will have to be put in place for the future.  One of the difficulties identified in connection with the new fourth year degree programme was that we would not introduce a two-tier nursing system, that those who graduated prior to last year and the year before would not be handicapped because of the new system.  We gave a commitment to nursing staff who trained over many years that they would not be handicapped by the changes.  Any system that is introduced to allow for continuing training after the three year programme will have to recognise the existing nursing staff.</P>
    <P>I am happy with the manner in which the new programme is progressing.  I am willing to debate and argue on the broad front at any time but to put it down after 12 months and to tamper with a certain amount of the funding is not good enough.  I welcome the opportunity to have the programme reviewed and to have a debate on it. It will have to be discussed on a broader front. The Minister is awaiting a report which I hope will highlight further changes for the benefits that can be achieved.  Given the numbers, the nursing staff are more important in the health care area than the doctors who are so restricted.  However they need fair treatment.  It is no good paying lip service.  We will have to do better than put down a narrow motion such as this.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm an deis seo a ghlacadh chun labhairt ar an ábhar seo mar creidim go laidir san obair atá ar siúl ag na mbanaltra sa tír seo.  Having spent the greater part of the past two years in and out of hospitals with various family members and having experienced the love, care and professionalism of nurses, I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this topic and particularly on the topic of student nurses.  They are academics and workers but yet are neither students nor nurses.  They are in danger of falling between two stools.  In the past a student nurse was on the ward in the second week of her training, having had just one week of academic work and went straight into the basic caring profession, which is the reason people enter nursing.  Now that there is change and there is the diploma course, student nurses must face an extraordinarily heavy academic content balanced by heavy <Col N="1139" /> clinical and work duties.  Their academic year is much longer than that of most other students, yet at the same time they have very onerous duties.</P>
      <P>When student nurses go into the hospital in theory they are meant to be extra-numerary.  In practice, they are not because there is not enough staffing in the hospitals and they find themselves having to take on the responsibilities and duties of nurses.  There are not enough supervisors or mentors for student nurses when they take up their placements and find themselves faced with the serious responsibility of dealing with very sick people.</P>
      <P>It is right and proper that student nurses should be looked after financially because of their dual role and I welcome the improvements by the Minister in the past year in relation to fees, books, grants, etc.  However, the decrease in the numbers joining the nursing profession is very worrying, as are the numbers of people who, having taken the diploma, do not want to go back into hospitals and dedicate themselves to that type of work.  There are a number of reasons for this, one of which is increased responsibility. There is a huge amount of documentation on every patient.  Nursing has become a very hi-tech profession which demands an expertise in computers which must be balanced with concern for the patient.  Nurses who have been registered for a number of years find that they are getting only two days training in computers each year, yet they are expected to work efficiently.  That is a worry for the profession.</P>
      <P>The increase in litigation against nurses is a serious worry, not just for themselves but for all of us because it involves extra stress on that profession. Nurses are being sued and reported to the fitness to practise commission.  Those nurses need greater support than they are receiving at present.  I would suggest that they do not get the same back up as their colleagues in the medical profession, for example.</P>
      <P>There is a very slow promotion rate for nurses. They do not receive the proper monetary benefit for courses undertaken and I would like to see all health boards recognise the value of such courses and encourage currently registered nurses to take them.</P>
      <P>With the change in practice and the higher academic qualifications of nurses, we need more care assistants in the hospitals.  Because of the staff shortage in nursing homes and hospitals, we need people who will do the basic caring work, which perhaps the student nurses did in their first or second weeks, in making the beds, helping to feed patients and in doing the minor care work. However, this role needs to be defined to show that it is different and the health boards need to provide courses for care assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people will not shy away from stress or responsibility.  They want to go into the caring professions and they want academic qualifications, but they want a role which is defined and properly supported.  I recognise the improvements <Col N="1140" /> which the Minister has given student nurses over the past year and hope this will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, in his efforts to support student nurses.  The tradition of pre-registration nursing education and training is in the process of being replaced by a new diplomabased programme.  This process will be completed this year in all three pre-registration nursing disciplines. The new programme is operated by schools of nursing in association with third level institutes.  Student nurses, who successfully complete registration/diploma, will be awarded a diploma in nursing from the associated third level institute and will be eligible to be registered as a nurse with An Bord Altranais.</P>
      <P>Nursing is a dedicated profession and a tremendous vocation, and student nurses should certainly get every facility, both financial and otherwise, to help them through their training.  I must congratulate Minister Cowen.  Since coming into office, he has increased the grants for student nurses at third level colleges by 20 per cent, bringing their maximum from £2,500 to £3,000.  I appeal to the Minister to further increase this figure this year.  He has provided special payments to students doing clinical placements who must find new accommodation during those periods. Where students do not move to new accommodation but take up their clinical placements from their normal base, he has provided transport passes to ensure they do not suffer financially.  He has moved to ensure that students must not pay for additional books during their course of studies in excess of the book allowance which his Department provides.  No uniforms need be purchased outside those covered by the uniform allowance, made available by his Department.  Compare this with the record of the previous Minister when no increase whatsoever was given during 1995, 1996 and up to June 1997, when the previous Government left office.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,155 training places for student nurses will be available this year as follows: general nursing, 781; psychiatric nursing, 201; and mental handicap nursing, 173.  These figures are to be welcomed.  Some 60 students are doing an 18 month postgraduate course at Tralee General Hospital, where there is an intake of students twice a year.  These students are a major asset to the Tralee hospital's staffing.</P>
      <P>The Government is firmly committed to the registration/diploma programme and to providing the necessary resources for its full implementation in all disciplines.  An additional £11 million over and above last year's figure has been made available this year for the programme.  Some £24 million in total will, therefore, be spent on the programme in 1998.  The available funding will meet the roll-over costs of the operation of the programme to date and finance the commencement of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April 1996, a comprehensive independent <Col N="1141" /> external evaluation of the registration/diploma programme commenced.  This is being undertaken by Professor Helen Simons and a team from the School of Education and Nursing at the University of Southampton under the management of the Institute of Public Administration. The evaluation, which includes both general nursing and psychiatric nursing programmes, will inform and facilitate decision-making about any future developments of the programme.  This exercise is due to be completed by July 1998.</P>
    <P>While the educational requirements for registration as a nurse will be satisfied at the point of the award of the diploma in nursing, the third level institutes, in accordance with the normal procedures applying to such institutes, are developing a one year programme for students who successfully register with An Bord Altranais and gain their diploma in nursing from any of the participating third level institutes.  Such degree programmes will be optional and nurses will be responsible for making their own arrangements for admission to, and attendance at, such programmes, including the payment of course fees.  I believe the Minister should come forward with some financial reward in this regard.  The timing of the degree programme must have regard to the registration process of An Bord Altranais, which means that the programme cannot commence before January each year.</P>
    <P>Registered nurses who do not have the diploma in nursing will, through their post-registration experience, be eligible to apply for entry to the degree programme.  Registered nurses who do not have prior learning which can be accredited by the third level institute can become eligible for entry to the degree programme by successfully completing a short access programme.  It is a requirement of approval of any funding arrangement with a third level institute involved in the delivery of the diploma programme that it offers access programmes to existing registered nurses who do not meet the degree entry requirements.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I urge the Minister for Health and Children to respond to the genuine concerns of student nurses and their families, and improve the financial assistance for such students. They must be allowed to undertake their training and education without the strain and stress of endeavouring to survive from a financial point of view.  I congratulate Deputy Shatter on bringing forward the motion and thank Fine Gael for supporting him in doing so.  I support the Deputy's call for the Government to provide a non-means tested grant of £75 per week, free meals for student nurses for the duration of their three year <Col N="1142" /> programme &mdash; whether completed in their designated base hospital or while undertaking an external clinical placement or academic studies &mdash; full payment to meet the expenditure in the new four-tiered agreed programme and full reimbursement of the cost of any secondary temporary accommodation required by student nurses when undertaking external clinical placements away from their base hospitals.</P>
      <P>Student nurses are not comparable to third level students.  They work 35 hours per week, 48 weeks of the year.  The Minister must recognise that student nurses do not have an opportunity to take up part-time employment and, therefore, do not generate any income when completing their training.  He must acknowledge the value of the work done by student nurses by taking action to overcome the hardships and difficulties experienced by them.</P>
      <P>Nurses are the most professional and competent people in the health service.  They are also the most undervalued in terms of pay and working conditions.  I know from experience that there are many stresses attached to nursing because my wife, Goretti, is a nurse, my only sister is a ward sister and my mother is a psychiatric nurse.  When people leave hospital they invariably praise the nursing staff.  Nurses are the first people patients meet on admission to hospital, they often bring the bad news of a death to relatives and they are the buffer between highly paid consultants and patients and their families.  Nurses are the human face of hospitals.</P>
      <P>In 1995 an independent survey showed that the stress levels experienced by Irish nurses are higher than in any other profession and they are among the highest in the world.  One of the reasons for the low pay and status of nurses is that the work is predominantly done by women. Nurses too often must carry out domestic duties. To employ for that work highly trained medical staff in whom such money has been invested is inefficient.  There should be a policy of employing additional nurse attendants and deploying nursing staff in the medical areas for which they are trained.  The provision of such attendants would alleviate the burden placed on nursing staff and it would be more cost-effective.</P>
      <P>In recent years the training and education of student nurses has been modernised.  This provides for 4,600 hours of theoretical and clinical instruction and it is a mixture of academic and practical training.  The work of student nurses includes elements of academic training and apprenticeship.  Apprentices in other professions are paid while completing academic and practical training.  As Deputy Shatter stated, apprentice solicitors are paid £125 per week when they commence training.  This model should apply to student nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a degree in nursing studies is now available.  I encourage the Minister to ensure that the maximum number of nurses is given the opportunity to complete this degree. Student nurses continue to supply practical work <Col N="1143" /> to the hospital services and are, therefore, not similar in any way to the general body of students.</P>
    <P>In recent months student nurses have found it necessary to protest publicly, which is unfortunate. They should not be placed in this position. From 1 March, the Minister increased the annual maintenance grant from £2,500 to £3,000 per annum.  Student nurses must maintain their rented accommodation for a full year throughout each of the three years in which they undertake training and studies while other third level students need only do so for a maximum of nine months.</P>
    <P>Given the rate of inflation, our tiger economy and the number of job opportunities on offer, it is difficult to retain nurses.  The Minister admitted that there is a shortage of nurses.  We should encourage students to train as nurses.</P>

I am also appalled by the lack of understanding of the case being made by student nurses and the Government's belief that it must vote down this motion.  Even at this late stage, I hope Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will reconsider their position and make available the small amount of money required to fulfil the wishes of student nurses.</P>
      <P>This year, the Government found plenty of money to introduce a budget to cater for the rich. When was the last time a Member on the Government benches &mdash; or any other Member for that matter &mdash; was obliged to live on £57 per week?  When was the last time they paid £20 &mdash; the grant paid to student nurses completing clinical placements in respect of accommodation &mdash; to rent a room in this city or anywhere else for one night, let alone for an entire week?  Will Members on the Government side inform me where such rooms can be found so that I can forward the information to the students nurses in the Public Gallery?  I cannot find such accommodation and I do not believe any student nurse has ever rented a room for £20 per week.  When did any Member of the Government find that a free bus pass was adequate to enable them to travel to areas outside our cities?  What use is a bus pass to student nurses who are obliged to work unsocial hours? It is no use.  Members on the Government side should not attempt to inform us how well off are student nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other speakers, I stress the need for student nurses to be treated like other third level students.  The Government must remove the need for students to pay fees for their degree course in UCG and it must do so immediately.  Where is the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, this evening?  With the number of PR <Col N="1144" /> people surrounding him, he must surely understand that this inequity must be removed.  Why in the age of the Celtic tiger are we discussing temporary secondary accommodation, bus passes and free meals?  Imagine having to ask the Minister to recognise that we are being obliged to beg for the provision of free meals to student nurses. That is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Many Members referred to the decrease in the numbers of people entering the nursing profession. It was stated that 1,139 entered training in 1997 as opposed to 1,328 in 1996.  Given the options available, it is little wonder that students are not choosing the difficult and demanding work required in nursing.  Many of them want to take up a career in nursing but are unable to do so because their families cannot afford to pay for their keep while they are undergoing training.  As Deputy Neville stated, people who spent time in hospital invariably state that they received excellent nursing care and could not have come through their stay without the care and attention provided by nurses.  Nurses are there when sick people feel the need for care and companionship at 4 a.m.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Government has the gall to oppose this motion.  In the remaining 40 minutes of the debate, I hope Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will agree to make a small adjustment to the budget which would allow fees to be waived and provide the additional benefits and grants required by student nurses.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated last night that these are exciting times for nurses and students.  The only excitement they have felt in recent years came when the Rainbow Coalition increased their wages and established the Commission on Nursing, which is due to report in the near future.  The current Government has done nothing to make the lives of nurses and students exciting.  Even at this late stage, I hope it will amend its ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Deputy Shatter for moving this motion.  I have received an increasing number of complaints, not only from nurses but also from patients, about the impact on the morale and availability of nurses of the approach taken by the Government.  The decline in recruitment to nursing is having an impact.  I have been told that the cancellation of 10,0000 elective surgery appointments in the Eastern Health Board area has arisen because of problems in the nursing area, including the lack of availability of sufficient nurses to man the wards to the levels expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are serious problems in the area of nursing. In the four hospitals on the north side of Dublin there is a waiting list of 7,500 people.  A quarter of all those waiting for hospital surgery throughout the country are attached to these hospitals.  If we are to deliver quality care we must look at the manning of our health services and the development of high morale and quality conditions for nurses.  It is becoming increasingly <Col N="1145" /> clear that unless we address seriously the issue of recruitment to nursing we will undermine what, for many decades, has been an extraordinarily high quality service.</P>
    <P>For far too long we have relied on the notion that nursing is a vocation where people can be expected to work for less than the going rate elsewhere. While nursing is a vocation, we cannot tread on the goodwill of people in that way.  We must be willing to pay people properly for undertaking student training and entering a profession that imposes many hardships and challenges and exposes people to the risk of litigation.  These people are in the front line in providing a crucial service.</P>
    <P>The change from the apprenticeship system was necessary because nursing has become far more complicated in recent years.  The demands on nursing are increasing all the time and nurses make crucial decisions.  It is increasingly clear they can develop even more competence and a greater capacity to deliver quality care in our hospitals if they are properly trained.</P>
    <P>While the move from the apprenticeship system to more theoretical training was welcome, regrettably student nurses seriously lost out.  The transfer was made in the interests of the public good, yet student nurses have been made to carry the can.  We must recognise that student nursing is not simply a parallel to other student occupations. Student nurses cannot forget about their studies when lectures are over because they are obliged to provide a quality service in the hospitals.  They are expected to work a 35 hour week, yet the supplement to support them is less than £58 per week.  This is unacceptable.  If a person on a community employment scheme was asked to work just 20 hours per week he or she would be provided with an income of over £90 per week.  By contrast, we expect student nurses to survive on less than two thirds of that.  Similarly, if instead of taking up a vocation in nursing a person went on the live register and decided to go into education after six months he or she would receive not only student grants but also a continuation of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>There must be equity in our approach to those whom we put in the front line of providing care for people when they are at their most vulnerable. There is, rightly, much indignation on this side of the House, which is reflected in the indignation of many student nurses about the treatment they have received in recent years.  For example, it is unacceptable that if nurses want a degree recognition, which they all should seek, they should have to pay fees that are not paid by other students in the system.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter for moving this motion.  There is an opportunity for the Independent Deputies, Sinn Féin and the other parties to support this motion to ensure that nurses, especially student nurses, get a fair crack of the whip.  The Government will not fall if the Independent Deputies vote in support of the <Col N="1146" /> motion.  However, they will send the Government a warning that they must be listened to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton mentioned that, because of the lack of nurses, there has been cancellations in surgery operations in the four major hospitals north of Dublin.  These hospitals undertake major surgery for the North-Eastern Health Board, so people in this region suffer likewise.</P>
      <P>Nurses play a very important role in the delivery of health care services and the care of patients.  This was made clear by the Government when in Opposition.  Their spokesperson stated that the nursing organisation should get what it wanted, although there was no word about from where the money would come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that student nurses, from whatever economic background, should be supported.  They have played a crucial role since the foundation of the State in the running of the hospitals.  It is unacceptable to suggest that, in the time of the Celtic tiger and great economic growth, they should be expected to work 35 hours per week, 48 weeks per year and receive only £57 per week.  In areas like Counties Cavan and Monaghan this money would not even rent a room, never mind provide food and a livelihood. They need strong financial backing from their families, which means that, once again, many student nurses in my constituency must go to the North or across the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>Should student nurses be provided with a basic social welfare payment of £68 per week and a flat allowance from the health board of £54 when those on social welfare can get so much?  Will the Minister assure the House he will take steps to improve the programme for student nurses and resolve their difficulties?  He says he is awaiting the deliberations of the Commission on Nursing and its evaluation team.  However, he knows the facts and he should make changes now.  Other students can take up part-time work, especially summer work.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest in student nurses as my 92 year old mother was a student nurse in the late 1920s.  Student nurses then received very little pay but at least they were housed and fed.  There is a shortage of nurses and steps must be taken now to rectify that.  The biggest problem in hospitals today is the lack of nurses.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter on moving this motion.  I am annoyed the Government should attack my party for introducing the motion.  At present student nurses receive £1.50 per hour.  We seek an increase of 50p in this hourly rate, yet Members on the Fianna Fáil benches say that nurses do not deserve such an increase.  What a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health in the previous Government built hospitals in Mullingar, Galway, Limerick and elsewhere and increased nurses' <Col N="1147" /> wages, which Fianna Fáil had neglected for years when in Government.  We are asking Government Deputies to support a motion that provides an increase of 50p per hour in the grant for student nurses.  If they do not support this motion, they will be a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our health service is in serious decline and is proving to be inadequate in coping with the demands of the sick.  Four weeks ago I outlined the problems in the Southern Health Board region, where staffing levels are inadequate. I was informed today that a seriously ill patient awaiting a bypass operation in Tralee General Hospital could not be admitted to Cork University Hospital.  On contacting that hospital I was informed he was one of 12 patients that should be admitted immediately and that six patients were on trolleys in the cardiac unit.  I was also informed that morale was never lower and that the staff were working under considerable stress and strain because of the level of under-staffing and the fact that they cannot cope with the problems they face.</P>
      <P>If student nurses are not adequately remunerated, the high spirits and high morale associated with those unsung heroes will wane. Access to nursing will be limited to those who can afford it.  Students from poorer sections of the community will not be able to join that profession because their parents will not be able to support them.  Student nurses cannot be compared to those undertaking other third level courses.  It is ludicrous to state that the change in pre-registration nursing education and training means the concept of a student nurse as a salaried employee no longer prevails.  The nature of their work, the length of the academic year and the cost of clothing and accommodation are important considerations when making a case for preferential treatment for student nurses.</P>
      <P>Approximately 900 students are undertaking the nursing diploma programme this year.  Over the past few months student nurses were involved in a public protest.  They are rightly critical of the inadequate provision made for them by the State while undertaking their diploma course.  The reality is many of them have to rely on handouts, parental financial assistance and are forced to obtain temporary work during unsocial hours and at weekends.  Having regard to their work commitment in their practical placements, it is highly undesirable that they should be placed in this position.  Given the context of the manner in which the diploma course is currently run, it has not been officially recognised that nursing students cannot be compared to other third level students.  It is not only in their interest but in the public interest that they should be treated differently. I add my support to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure for me to be associated with this motion calling for an increase <Col N="1148" /> in grant for student nurses.  The nursing profession is one of the most dedicated and caring in the world.  Student nurses are vital to the continuation of that laudable profession.  They deserve better treatment than they are getting.  In this age of the Celtic tiger surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility they could be given a decent non-means tested grant of at least £75 per week, free meals during their three year training programme whether in a designated base hospital or while undertaking an external clinical placement or academic studies, full payment to meet the expenditure incurred in the new fourth year degree programme and full reimbursement of the cost of any second temporary accommodation required when they are undertaking external clinical placement.</P>
      <P>It is time common sense prevailed.  The increase in the grant advocated in this motion is only a drop in the ocean compared to overall Government spending.  Having listened to Government speakers it was evident they have lost track of the major input made by student nurses to their profession.  I cannot see how any Government Deputy can go through the lobby and vote down this motion which provides for a modest increase in the grant for student nurses. Do Government Deputies realise that if they vote down this motion, they will be cutting a twig with which to beat themselves.  They or I may be in hospital at some time in the future when they will have to rely on student nurses to bring them back to full health and vigour.</P>
      <P>In this era of the Celtic tiger surely the Government will not have it on its conscience to oppose an increase in the grant for student nurses.  I call on the Independent Deputies who support the Government to let common sense prevail.  They would not bring down the Government by voting for this Fine Gael motion that is supported by all Opposition parties, but would give it a jerk that would bring it back to reality and would show it has a caring approach.</P>

Nurses have a pivotal role in the delivery of health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this worthy motion.  The Minister of State should do the decent thing and accept the motion in the spirit in which it is proposed. Nursing is a caring profession.  At one time or other, all will have experienced the benefit of the care of nursing staff in hospitals.  We will have seen that it is not a &ldquo;nine to five&rdquo; job, nurses stay at their task as long as the sick are in need.</P>
      <P>To meet the demand for nursing staff we must have student nurses.  It is almost impossible for young people to train as nurses given the present level of remuneration.  We do not seek rewards over and above that which is needed to ensure an adequate supply of nurses.  Many senior medical professionals will admit that they have not got the back up staff needed to meet the demands placed on them.</P>
      <P>Through their constituency work Deputies will know people who are in need of surgery.  I became aware today of the case of a constituent of mine who has been waiting nine months in severe pain for a prostate gland operation.  He was told today that he must wait a further three months.  This arises because hospitals cannot meet the demands placed on them as they do not have the back-up nursing staff.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for student nurses who, immediately on starting their training, are thrown in at the deep end, so to speak.  If the Minister is not aware that they work then he is out of touch. I have no objection to their working because it is part of their training.  They must also attend lectures and sit exams.  However, the students do not have time on their hands because there are not enough full-time nurses and this is because we are not training enough nurses.  There was a time when Irish nurses were in great demand internationally and we could supply that demand. However, we now seek nurses from abroad to supply the demand here.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate standard which is expected of student nurses entering training colleges should be re-examined.  Nursing is a vocation and nurses are born, not made.  The standards set do not allow many young people who would make excellent and caring nurses to enter the profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State should ask the Minister for Education and Science to take to task the people who are setting the leaving and junior certificate examinations this year.  What sort of zombies are they?  They have put young people through outrageous terror this month with questions which are irrelevant to the needs of society. It is an aside but it is important and if the current <Col N="1152" /> trend continues we will not be able to fill places in professions across the board.  I will not lower myself to appeal to the Independent Members. Let them be judged on the decisions they take when they go through the lobbies tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Shatter for tabling this motion.  The Minister of State spoke about money.  He is a disgrace.  The Government took in £115 million extra in December, more revenue than expected in January and saved £100 million in social welfare attacking the poor people throughout the country.  There is no excuse; the money is there.  Since the Government took up office, it opened hospital after hospital for which Deputy Noonan put money in place.  For ten years prior to that Fianna Fáil was in Government and it did nothing about health and nurses.  We had to deal with that problem in Government and pay them a proper wage and now we must deal with student nurses who must be paid a proper wage.</P>
      <P>People in the west of Ireland want to be trained.  According to the points system they could be doctors or consultants, but they want to be nurses.  Deputy Boylan is right.  Constituents also come to my office and all they want is to become nurses.  The Minister of State and the Government should be able to provide a few pounds to assist them to be trained.  The Minister yesterday acknowledged there was a shortage of nurses.  However, the Government will do what it did to the teachers.  Many teachers were trained a few years ago and there was not enough jobs for them; now there is not enough teachers.  Will we do the same with nurses?  The money can and should be found if people are to be trained.  If they are to be treated properly by the State £75 per week is not too much to ask while £10 million is a small token.  We did the hard work in regard to hospitals and nurses.  We are asking the Government not to find £300 million or £400 million, but £10 million.  That is not too difficult.  I call on Deputies Healy-Rae and Fox to support us tonight.  We will give the Government the injection it needs.</P>
      <P>I received a telephone call earlier from a man in the county hospital in Castlebar crying with the pain in his hands.  He had to wait to be called to the Minister of State's hospital in Galway.  Since the Government took up office the system has collapsed again.  The Government paid the penalty before when a famous Taoiseach did not realise things were so bad.  Things are bad and the people are waiting.  These young nurses are entitled to a few pounds.  Do not mind the officials.  They will find the money if the Minister of State directs them.</P>

      <P>There is a simple basic message; what student nurses rightly seek and demand is extraordinarily modest.  They want a grant of £75 <Col N="1153" /> per week instead of the current £57 per week.  No Member would live on £75 per week and they know they could not.  The amount student nurses currently get is less than they would get if they were in receipt of unemployment assistance. Unemployment assistance is £68 per week. Student nurses are told we value what they do to a lesser degree than we value the position of someone who is not working.</P>
      <P>What about their work and the strange word &ldquo;supernumerary&rdquo;?  The Minister for Health and Children stated that &ldquo;when these students do their clinical placements, they are not expected to work as part of the general staffing of a ward&rdquo;.  I challenge the Minster of State to ask any of the student nurses in the public gallery what would happen to them on their diploma courses; what report would they get and what would the possibility of them qualifying be if they said to the staff nurse on the ward to which they had been appointed for their placements: &ldquo;I am sorry; I cannot do this; I am not supposed to be working; I am supernumerary; I came here to watch&rdquo;. Could anyone credibly think that is the role played by student nurses?</P>
      <P>Deputy Hanafin got it right, unlike a number of her colleagues who came to the House in a medicated trance delivering scripts handed out to them by the Minister for Health and Children, the central part of which was to tell him what a fine chap he was.  She said they are students and workers.  They are crucial and essential workers within our health system and their work is not valued or recognised.  The Government expects these students to live in extraordinary hardship and difficulty and it is forcing students who work a 35 hour week while undertaking their studies and making a practical and beneficial commitment to the community to go out and work again at the weekends and in the late hours of the evening to scrape together an extra few pounds. Rather than the roar of the Celtic tiger we heard a self-satisfied complacent purring of the Fianna Fáil pussycats.  We did not hear from any member of the Progressive Democrats Party; they have gone missing.</P>

      <P>I spoke to a number of students nurses who said the measly sum of £20 that is supposed to be made available to them if they have to get alternative accommodation is not being paid in a number of areas.  Neither the health boards nor the hospital authorities know how to administer it.  For many student nurses it is illusory as are the bus passes for the minimal use they have, which are not furnished or made available.</P>
      <P>Student nurses are getting a raw deal.  In the context of the Department of Health and Children, that they are part of the health workforce is not recognised.  In the context of the Department of Education and Science they are invisible. In the context of the four year degree course in NUI, Galway, which will be available in other universities next year to student nurses coming through the diploma system, the Department of Education and Science decided they would be the only undergraduates for whom fees will not be exempted.  What political caveman vision is involved in telling student nurses they will be actively discouraged from obtaining a degree after they have completed their diploma course or that we will not provide them with financial assistance and, unlike other undergraduates, will be required to pay fees even though the nursing degree has undergraduate status, that we will penalise them for undertaking the course by requiring them to pay fees and will not exempt them when thousands of students are exempt from third level undergraduate fees?</P>
      <P>There is a public interest in the best possible training being available to student nurses and in ensuring they can be involved in an educational system which facilitates them in providing care within hospitals and other care agencies which they want to provide upon qualification.  I invite the Government to accept the motion and call on the Minister not to divide the House.  I thank the parties on this side of the House who support the motion and will vote with us.</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was discussing the broad economic guidelines which have been agreed at Commission level.  It is worth spending a couple of minutes thinking about how that happens.  As I understand it, Ireland is represented at official level in discussions of the monetary committee. The monetary committee subsequently submits its considerations to the Commission and the ECOFIN council.  They are normally rubberstamped.</P>
      <P>Until this year, none of us paid a great deal of attention to that.  However, it will become a great deal more important in future years and will form at least one of the pillars informing the political remit of the central bank, the economic policy of the ECOFIN council and the euro eleven committee. It is very important that we have a distinct democratic input to the formation of those guidelines. It is also important that this House knows the contribution being made on behalf of Ireland to those guidelines.  None of that information is in the public arena.  The deliberations of the monetary committee are, by statute of the European Treaties, held in private.  This position is not acceptable.  In future these guidelines will become very important in informing the way in which European economic policy is decided.  We need look no further back than a couple of months ago when we were effectively told we were spending too much, that excessive tax cuts had been granted, that we should stop spending too much and should not grant any tax cuts in the upcoming budget.</P>
      <P>It is incumbent on us to maintain a certain measure of independence.  We must maintain, inasmuch as we can, independence in the way in which we distribute the benefits of growth in society.  We should look to maintain independence in the whole area of tax harmonisation because the agenda has moved on over the past six months to a year.  Tax harmonisation has gone from being something for which people hope some time in the future to being very much towards the top of the agenda.  Not for the first time the co-ordination of DIRT tax is being discussed by the ECOFIN Council.  Perhaps more importantly, we will undoubtedly be required in time to co-ordinate corporation taxes, and there are those who hope we will also co-ordinate income taxes.  This is a process we should do our best to resist.  I am not naive in the matter.  I realise it is something we cannot avoid forever if it is the will of the bigger countries, but we should do our best to resist it, at least for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discussions over the past weekend about the EU budget are also of considerable importance <Col N="1158" /> to Ireland.  I was somewhat concerned by the reported remarks of the Taoiseach in relation to that budget.  He is reported to have said that we could live within the current 1.27 per cent limit provided reform of CAP was not as thorough going as had been suggested.  This suggests, in traditional Irish fashion, that our primary interest in the EU budget is the CAP.  If one looks at the overall figures, that has been the case in the past. I emphasise that, while we acknowledge the dependence of many parts of the farming community on the CAP, there are others who also have their call on EU funding.  We have started to spend money, hesitantly but in some ways effectively over the past while, on inner city communities, on local development and support and on infrastructural development in areas which are not as well off as others.  That focus has to continue, and form an important part of the demand we make on the EU budget into the future.</P>
    <P>I have never understood why the transitional process is as long as it is.  I was interested to hear the Minister confirm that he wants to give himself power in this Bill to terminate the transitional process any time after 1 January 2002 and does not necessarily see the joint circulation of currencies continuing until 30 June.  I have never understood why it is necessary to have a three year changeover period in the first place.  The argument usually advanced is that it will literally take that length of time to produce the notes and coins.  It is beyond me why it should take five or six years to produce notes and coins.  It seems this is inviting an additional period of potential instability. It is not a road that we need necessarily have gone down, although I accept at this stage it is unlikely we will change that.</P>
    <P>Reading the detail of the Bill, is it necessary to go through, for example, legislation in relation to the criminal law, to review the fines imposed and change them into euro?  The Minister said that contracts would be automatically denominated in euro during the changeover period and law would also be denominated in euro in so far as it was relevant.  However, that provision is not in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials could help me in that regard.  The Minister also spoke about the fact that we would be able to use cheques and other negotiable instruments from 1 January next.  I would like more detail as to how this will work.  At the moment there is this phenomenon called a eurocheque.  Using a eurocheque issued by an Irish bank one can in theory go into a premises in Holland or Germany and write a cheque in the local currency which will then clear through one's own bank in time.  Anybody who has ever tried to use it will realise that the principle is very good but it does not work very well.  It seems that if we are to use cheques and other instruments of that kind, there is a need for the banks, if they are not already doing it, to improve their clearing systems so that we can use cheques in a way that means something to ordinary people, tourists as well as business people.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some clarification, but <Col N="1159" /> there are one or two issues that need to be teased out in relation to transaction charges and commission that the banks will charge during the changeover period.  At the moment, if an ordinary individual wants to buy currency the bank will offer a particular rate, it will offer business a different rate, and a different rate again to the wholesale market.  I understand that following 1 January next, there will be one rate and one rate only, so that there will be no discrimination between business, the wholesale market and individual customers.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that.  Certainly there can be no justification for spreading a risk if there is no exchange rate in the first place.</P>
    <P>We also need clarification in relation to the transaction costs.  It is my understanding that the banks have agreed to charge minimal non-commission transaction and administrative costs for changing over between euro and Irish pounds or any of the other individual currencies.  Has agreement been reached on the level of those costs because there is a danger that if it is excessive customers will quickly become cynical about the advantages in relation to transaction costs etc., that were meant to accrue following the introduction of the single currency?</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's reflections on the bond market.  He will know that many people who are active in the bond market believe it will not do well out of this, that the demand for Irish bonds will diminish considerably and that demand for Irish Government debt will also diminish considerably.  Clearly there will be a need, if we want to stay in this market, for the NTMA and Government to market Irish Government debt quite aggressively after 1 January next since the obvious advantages which it holds at the moment will simply disappear.  I would be interested to hear whether there have been discussions with the NTMA and whether Government has made any specific decisions in relation to that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan began his contribution by saying that effectively EMU is a political project.  My party has endorsed it as such.  It has potential economic disadvantages which we have gone through many times in this House.  The fact that sterling will remain outside EMU is clearly a potential competitive disadvantage.  It will impose a need for flexibility in areas where currently flexibility is not to be found.  There are other disadvantages and potential difficulties, but on the passing of what I think will be the last legislation on this historic move, it behoves us all to be positive and say that on the balance of advantage to Ireland this is something we should do both for our economic benefit and because it is an economic necessity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My party too will support this Bill.  It is a major technical Bill, but it is a great deal more than that.  It is very significant in terms of the historical nature of the decision we are <Col N="1160" /> making.  The Minister's speech deals in very succinct fashion with the preparations that have been made, the provisions for an awareness campaign, including reference to the Forfás campaign for business, limited reference to the distribution of leaflets for the domestic consumer and so on. There is little or nothing in the speech about the history or political significance of this monumental decision.  That is a pity from a number of points of view.  It is a technical measure and it is an economic measure but it is, above all, a gargantuan political project with an economic dimension.  It is the politics and the historical proportions of it that ought to be emphasised on an occasion like this because, as Deputy McDowell said, we have discussed the pros and cons on a number of occasions and I see little point in retailing them again.  We are underselling the size and importance of the decision we are making by stripping it of its political excitement.</P>
      <P>It is 200 years since there was a debate of this proportion leading to the Act of Union.  What we are engaged in now is nothing less than the abolition of the national currency.  That is a major decision.  We are abolishing the national currency because we are entering another union &mdash; the economic and monetary union.  It is a political construct and it is a pity, therefore, that there seems to be a European-wide consensus to sell it as being about economics, business and commerce. The result is that we have lost the attention of the people.</P>
      <P>One only has to examine the results of the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty to note from the level of abstentionism and the scale of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote that we have a real problem in a democratic sense. It is difficult to account for the high level of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote on the Amsterdam Treaty given the scale and proportion of that treaty which, in other circumstances, might not be the subject of a referendum at all, yet the people took the opportunity to express that view, including very many fervently committed Europeans.  They voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; because they do not like the way we do our business. They do not like the fashion in which the Union does its business.  They do not like the bureaucracy that goes with it or the decisions being made by the bureaucracy.  The entire structure of the decision-making process lends itself to decisions being made behind closed doors and the people rarely being involved.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable, when one considers the dimensions of the decision we are making, that there has been so little debate.  The debate, in so far as it has taken place, has been left to economists. That is regrettable.  The political community has not really engaged in the debate and in selling the significance of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of leaving the decision to economists is particularly regrettable because we have seen a number of anti-EMU economists lead the debate, similar to the way some other people led the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty as if that treaty were about neutrality.  Neutrality struck a <Col N="1161" /> chord with a number of Irish people not otherwise engaged.  Similarly, the economists who want to push a particular line, notwithstanding their unremarkable record in predicting events up to now, not least the current boom &mdash; it is remarkable that was not predicted by an economist; perhaps it might have changed the course or the timing of general elections &mdash; know the answers on this question and they are very vocal.  By and large there is not a political riposte to that.</P>
    <P>There are economists of a certain persuasion who argue that EMU will be our ruination for what seems to be a peculiar reason, namely, that it will stop the Government doing what needs to be done to stop inflation getting out of control. According to this peculiar view, the Government needs to hike interest rates, reduce the growth rate, slow down job creation and, by implication, increase unemployment.  I invite those economists who hold this view to stand for election on this platform at the next opportunity.  On second thoughts, that might not be such a good idea because I might involve myself in being complicit in a lynching mob because that is the reception they would get from ordinary people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that those who are advising against membership of EMU have a point in highlighting domestic inflationary pressures, but the answer to inflation is not a big hike in the mortgage rate, more expensive lending and a generalised slowing down of economic activity.  That is the liberal, free market, anti-social way of dealing with inflation.</P>
      <P>The other point the anti-EMU economists make is that we need the freedom to control the exchange rate against sterling.  They are really saying they do not want to have a strong currency, but keeping our currency down against sterling is itself an inflationary policy.  Are we also to have imported inflationary pressures as well as high interest rates and lower growth?  This may make some sense to the mind of a peculiar type of economist but it makes no sense in the real world of ordinary, sensible people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Perry make the argument that the Minister should spearhead a county by county awareness campaign designed for small business.  I have no objection to that and Forfás would probably say that is already taking place to some extent, but we are losing the argument on the wider significance of what we are doing &mdash;<Col N="1162" /> going back to Deputy Noonan's opening remarks about the political and historical derivation of this &mdash; if we say it is exclusively a matter for businessmen. Unless we can engage the public to some extent in terms of this project, ultimately it could have serious implications for us.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the question of the Central Bank and expressed the view that it could have serious implications down the road if Irish people got the impression that the leading core economies in Europe were dictating the pace. That is a real fear.  After all, we have not had too much to complain about in the past 25 years or so.  The average person in the street is sensible enough to know we have done quite well out of the EU but if the indications are that European institutions will dictate our fiscal policy, and we will provide an additional string to the bow of economists here who would want us to roll back on issues like tax reform, many people might take a different view.  We have already heard noises to that effect.</P>
    <P>We have not heard the Minister comment on the question of the apparent mishandling of our aspirations in respect of the European Central Bank.  We do not know what weight the Minister attaches to the outcome.  The reason put forward by the Taoiseach is that we did not have candidates offering themselves for these positions, a most unusual phenomenon in Irish society.  In any walk of life it is rare not to find candidates.  I am sure the Civil Service would blush at the notion that it could be so reticent that nobody of an appropriate calibre offered for the position, but apparently that was the case.  We need to hear the Minister's rationale for the fact that of the 23 top managerial posts referred to by Deputy McDowell, Ireland does not feature among them.  What is the significance of that in terms of policies that might be pursued in the future and in terms of responsiveness of the institutions to a small country that is at a different point in the business cycle from some of the lead economies?  What is the ability and willingness of the institutions to respond to our need?  I do not know the significance of having lost out.  I do not know what arrangements may have been made behind the scenes in terms of our being enabled to catch up in the years immediately ahead.  We seem to be playing in the second division and that is a matter of concern.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a point with the Minister in terms of the chorus that we are heading into an inflationary spiral which will do serious damage to the economy in the medium term.  I know the theory of it, but is it heresy to question whether it is absolutely necessary that we should follow interest rates across the eleven?  I am not entirely sure why that is obligatory.  If there was a widely diverging interest rate here, some of the ten partners might consider it could be used to attract money from other economies and might not look favourably on it.  If we have particular difficulties, are at a different point in the business cycle, and are beginning to go in a different inflationary <Col N="1163" /> direction from the rest of Europe, why is it essential we should come into line on interest rates immediately and to the same extent?  I would like the Minister to address that point.</P>
    <P>It seems to be accepted that if we are in a Single Market not only should we ideally have a single currency but we also should accept the same interest rates.  I am not entirely sure that is the case.  Some damage will be done if the position gets worse between now and the time the currency becomes effective here.  There could be serious wobbles during that period and we ought to hear a statement of policy on that.</P>
    <P>When I derided a certain economic point of view earlier I did not mean to dismiss the fact that there are inflationary pressures in the economy. Notwithstanding the view of the Minister for Finance, there is no evidence there will be serious cuts in public spending.  From what one reads, the Government has been happy to capitulate to the Garda.  I do not know where the Minister for Finance stands on that issue, but presumably it has his sanction.  I agree with the views expressed by the Taoiseach that the notion of ring-fencing any such development within the public service is nonsense.  That cannot be done because there would be implications.</P>
    <P>I am not as confident as my other colleagues about the measures in the Bacon report in terms of tackling the extraordinary price spiral in the property market, which is horrific.  I am aware of another challenge by a young couple in my constituency who bought a house on 7 January for £99,950 and in the week before St. Patrick's day the builder withdrew from the arrangement and offered them the house at £135,000, an increase of 35 per cent in less than three months.  The same houses, which are in Tallaght, are now advertised in the newspapers at £160,000.</P>

      <P>That is an extraordinary commentary. Similar circumstances arose in Trim and a major case is pending in the courts against a developer there who inflated the price of an entire estate.  Gazumping is still going on.  Having derided the anti-EMU point of view, I do not mean to dismiss the fact that there are inflationary pressures.  I would appreciate the Minister's reply to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night on the Investor Compensation Bill the question of the consumer was discussed.  Most of the preparations are designed to bring business up to speed on the transfer to the euro.  There is a consumer interest and, if we are politically prudent, there is a definite consumer dimension to this entire issue.  Regardless of what the experts think, there is no doubt that in the mind of the consumer the euro will be implemented in terms of rounding up rather than rounding down. It is important some mechanism is put in place to give public assurance on that issue, and that includes banks.  The Minister said there will be no <Col N="1164" /> question of banks imposing charges for this service, but I will believe that when I see it.  Banks would charge for walking through their swing doors if they thought they would get away with it, and all the evidence suggests they have got away with it up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Bill to the House. This is the third Bill to come before the House this year containing provisions relating to EMU and the changeover to the euro.  It is designed to provide for changes in monetary law and other changes necessary for the introduction of the euro not covered by the Central Bank Act, 1998, or the Finance Act, 1998.  While much of the Bill is technical in nature, it will provide additional legal certainty to the markets, in regard to the substitution from 1 January 1999 of EURIBOR, the euro area reference rate, in place of DIBOR, the current standard for the Dublin market, and also in regard to the redenomination of debt.  It will also facilitate companies that wish to redenominate their share capital.</P>
      <P>The Bill makes a historic change in our currency through law in that section 6 introduces into the Central Bank Act, 1989, a declaration that by virtue of EU Regulation 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State is the euro and the Irish pound unit is a sub-division of the euro.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte in terms of the enormity and significance of the change that is taking place in Ireland and Europe in the context of monetary union.</P>
      <P>The euro can be used for cashless transactions from 1 January 1999, but the Irish pound can also be used for cashless transactions during the transitional period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001.  Cash transactions will remain in Irish pounds, as euro notes and coins will not be available during the transitional period.  Euro notes and coins will be put into circulation on 1 January 2002.  The EU legal framework provides that national currency notes and coins may remain legal tender for at most six months after that date, up to 30 June 2002 at the latest.  Member states may shorten this period by national law.  Thus, section 9 confirms that the Minister may, by order, set a date earlier than 30 June 2002 for the withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins.  It is of course too early to set this date now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the provisions I have mentioned, the Bill also includes provisions recognising the role of the European Central Bank in regard to the issue of notes and the volume of coins to be issued, and deals with the two imperfections identified by the European Monetary Institute in its March 1998 legal convergence report.  Now that <Col N="1165" /> Ireland has qualified for the start of EMU on 1 January 1999, it is timely to complete our domestic legislative preparations for it, and the Bill achieves that.</P>
    <P>Our other practical preparations for the changeover to the euro are also far advanced.  The EMU business awareness campaign being run by Forfás has had a considerable impact, producing timely and useful information for business on the changeover to the euro, and the planning and preparation required to achieve a smooth transition. As the Minister noted, some 35,000 copies of the Forfás information pack for business have been distributed, in addition to more than 80,000 copies of a short leaflet specifically aimed at small and medium size enterprises.  The high quality of the Forfás material has been acknowledged here and elsewhere.  As regards information for the public, this month's advertising campaign has focused on delivering clear messages to the general public about the changeover to the euro, and includes a leaflet which is being distributed to every household.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the Bill is the provision relating to redenomination of debt in section 23.  That section governs the arrangements under which bonds and other tradeable debt instruments may be redenominated during the period from 1999 to the beginning of 2002.  It also contains certain provisions to make it easier for the non-tradeable debt of State bodies to be redenominated. It is very important that we should be in a position to redenominate our domestic currency debt into the euro as soon as it becomes possible to do so, namely, from the beginning of 1999.  This is because Ireland will be a very small issuer in a bond market with a value equivalent to around $3 trillion and we will need to secure our place and reputation within that market.  In this regard, it is important that we carry out redenomination promptly and transparently.  The NTMA has announced its intention to redenominate at the beginning of 1999 and has just published an explanation of the method it currently proposes to use.  This Bill provides that the Minister will set down by order the method to be used by the NTMA and provides for the use of that method by other bond issuers wishing to redenominate during the transition period.</P>
    <P>With regard to Irish Government debt issued under the law of other participating member states, the NTMA will keep the question of redenomination under review.  If it is in Ireland's best interest to redenominate the debt, it will do so and the provision for a notification in Iris Oifigiúil will ensure the transparency of that procedure.</P>
    <P>Section 23(3) is intended to facilitate State bodies who decide to redenominate their non-tradeable debt.  The subsection seeks to eliminate the administrative burden which would otherwise arise when such redenomination was carried out, which would involve the State body seeking renewed consent for existing facilities.  This subsection waives that requirement, but subject <Col N="1166" /> strictly to the limit on borrowing to which consent has already been given.</P>
    <P>The EMU Bill marks another important stage in our preparations for EMU and the changeover to the euro.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect this will be one of the last opportunities the House will have to debate EMU.  Clearly, it is not a subject that excites the media &mdash; as we can see from the empty Gallery &mdash; or captures the imagination of the public.  The reason for this is that the media is now part of the establishment.  As the very fine journalist, John Pilger recently stated the establishment is very pro-EMU.  The public does not know any better.  It became increasingly obvious that there was overwhelming ignorance on matters relating to EMU during the recent debate on the Amsterdam Treaty referendum.  People are ignorant because they are not informed.  The political establishment has sought deliberately not to inform members of the public and, where necessary, to mislead them on the question of EMU. A vox pop would reveal that the public believes EMU is simply about a single currency that will be convenient when they go on holidays to Torremolinos or to Italy where they will not have to deal with pocketfuls of pesetas or lira.  The public does not realise we are dispensing with the exchange rate mechanism and giving up the power to effect interest rates.  They do not understand the gravity of the matter.  This huge step is unprecedented.  Yet, the level of debate shows we are sleep walking in terms of EMU.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty we witnessed blatant dishonesty from the Labour Party, Democratic Left and Fianna Fáil.  In fairness to Fine Gael, it was more up front about the European project.  It supports a federal Europe and a European army.  It makes perfect sense, therefore, that it should support the EMU. However, other parties claim to be opposed to the creation of a federal European superstate, but also support EMU.  Fianna Fáil, along with the Gaullists in Europe, have always supported a Europe of the nations, which is a good idea. However, the Minister for Finance must know that EMU will put an end to that notion.</P>
      <P>EMU is first and foremost a political project. The Euro federalists hope it will be the glue that will hold together this artificial superstate.  Far from bringing harmony and unity to Europe, EMU will create further political tensions which will result in social unrest and upheaval and the emergence of the extreme right wing elements. While the euro might be a political project, it is also an undemocratic one.  If there had been a European-wide referendum on the euro, would it have passed?  I do not believe it would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European leaders are beginning to detect a certain level of dissatisfaction among ordinary Europeans who realise we are seeing the creation of a federal superstate.  Consequently, M. Jacques Chirac and Mr. Helmet Kohl wrote to Mr. Tony Blair on the eve of the Cardiff summit stating &ldquo;it <Col N="1167" /> cannot be the goal of European policy to establish a central European state&rdquo;.  How hypocritical and disingenuous can politicians become?  For simply domestic political reasons, Helmet Kohl is now donning Euro sceptic clothing with which he will dispense after the German elections if he is successful, but I do not believe he will be.  This is the great architect of the European Union, the man who wants a federal superstate with Germany in the driving seat and who said &ldquo;a European army and a European police force lie at the end of the road to European union&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We will eventually see a European army and a European police force &mdash; a type of European FBI &mdash; and the euro is becoming a reality.  This is because we want to be up there with the big guys. We believe we have earned respect because of our Celtic tiger economy, but we should not fool ourselves.  Klaus-Dieter Kuhbacher, a member of the council of the Bundesbank, recently made disparaging comments about our economy.  He said we depended too much on the EU and he did not see us as part of the euro eleven states. He believes Ireland and Luxembourg are insignificant and that there is a club of only nine member states.  We were recently overlooked when the members of the European Central Bank were chosen.  This shows we are insignificant players. Deputy McDowell commented on this in his contribution.</P>
    <P>The economic consequences of membership of EMU without Britain will not be insignificant and they are already becoming apparent.  Today I read in the <i>Financial Times</i> that Mr. Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, said the British economy was beginning to overheat. If that is the case, our economy must be on fire and we have given away the fire hoses &mdash; control of our exchange and interest rates.  We hope the fire will burn itself out.</P>
    <P>An unprecedented opportunity for Ireland has become a threat.  It is important to reflect on how we achieved this economic boom and what gave rise to it.  The phenomenon of the Celtic tiger coincided with the independent exchange rate policy we introduced after devaluing because of the currency crisis and leaving the ERM.  Prior to that we were tied to sterling at par.  It is interesting to note that the people who said we should not devalue are the same people who are now saying we must join EMU, yet in conventional economic terms we have not looked back since we devalued.</P>
    <P>This success is also due to the fact that we started to work together in partnership agreements. However, those agreements are under severe strain because of EMU.  Deputy Deenihan spoke about the need for wage flexibility.  The Governor of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said we will be on our own if we experience an asymmetric shock.  We must then make internal adjustments and we will require wage flexibility. What does that mean?</P>
    <P>I have read carefully the statements by the <Col N="1168" /> Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, about the opt-out clause in the partnership agreements and competitiveness within EMU.  If we have problems, does that mean the Minister will go back to the social partners and say we must renegotiate?  Wage cuts would be unthinkable. We are currently experiencing inflationary pressures in certain sectors.  Members in this House, for example, cannot get secretaries because of the paltry wages being offered.  This matter was brought to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is also difficult to get chefs, while bricklayers earn £800 a week.  These are the fruits of the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>We also see inflationary pressures in house prices.  Some Fine Gael Deputies said the Bacon report was not working.  I spoke to an economist recently about this issue.  Why are we experiencing such pressures in the housing market?  EMU has had an influence on the huge increase in house prices.  Young couples cannot afford a house.  Our house prices are now comparable to those in continental Europe.  We are following the European model where people no longer own a house but live in an apartment.  We are trying to ignore the fact that EMU has a bearing on this.</P>
    <P>During a previous debate on EMU Deputy McDowell said that it was one thing to have monetary union but we could not have fiscal union. In other words, he had grave concerns about tax harmonisation.  I do not know how one can have monetary union without fiscal union.  It is unprecedented. Are discussions taking place on tax harmonisation in the future?  That is of concern to many Deputies and other people.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Noonan's statement that the preparation for EMU is precise because there were a number of fudges.  As this was a political project, we fudged the criteria to allow people to join.  We must be extremely careful as we are in a straitjacket and this will become apparent on budget day.  We have already heard the warnings of Professor Brendan Walsh.  There would be an outcry if the tax concessions were not delivered on.</P>
    <P>Can we still go to an ECOFIN summit and say we want to defer membership for two years to get things in order?  I was told by an economist today that if we did that there would be a sigh of relief from many people.  We should consider that because it is like a simmering pot which we cannot sustain any longer.  We must defer entry because it is absolute folly to go into EMU without Britain.</P>

      <P>Unlike the last speaker and a number of other speakers, I and my party are enthusiastic supporters of EMU.  There will always be swings and roundabouts in any transition. We must protect ourselves and our consumers from being ripped off by someone who decides in the transition period, as Deputy Rabbitte said, to round up prices instead of rounding them down.  Prices should be rounded down because there will be savings.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> Economists and financial experts will decry EMU because they have a vested interest.  Their influence is being removed and they will not be able to get involved to the same extent as they did.  Deputy Gormley mentioned the economist who said there would be a huge sigh of relief across Europe if we deferred our membership of EMU.  That would not be the case.</P>

      <P>Today the exchange rate is 1.38. If there is a lesson anywhere in relation to EMU that is it.  The one dollar bill which was in circulation in the United States 35 or 40 years ago is still in circulation and a legal tender note while our beloved pound has long since gone and been replaced by a coin.  The UK is contemplating replacing other notes with coins.  The lesson to be learned is that if there is a multiplicity of currencies with a multiplicity of exchanges, the economies in the relevant countries will pay the piper. We must ensure we do not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the European Central Bank or total control, that was never the intention.  There are merits in taking some decisions out of the political arena.  For example, in the past 40 years how many times has economic development been stunted by the stopgo system of the political situation?  After election all spending ceased; in the run-up to election all spending started.  How many times has that seriously affected investment in our economy in the past 40 years?  Continuity should flow from EMU.  I am not an economist but I know that if we do not plan over a reasonable period we will not get the economic results.  If we want proof of this we have only to go back to the 1960s and the programmes for economic recovery of Seán Lemass, which were all based on planning and certain projections over a specified period.  If that is not done one does not get results.  The effect of those plans was to eliminate some of the doubt so that those who were involved in investing their money in jobs, industry and so on had some indication on where the thinking was leading and it was not likely to be interrupted by a political whim, which is where the danger is involved.  That is not to say we should hand over all authority to a European Central Bank or a central bank in any country.  There must be a certain amount of accountability, that is important for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago the chief of the German Central Bank was unfortunate in some of the remarks he made to the effect that the bank ruled all.  The <Col N="1170" /> bank does not rule all.  There are political and human considerations.  That is not to say we should have such a flexible system that it can be changed overnight to meet the individual political situations and requirements of each and every country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gormley mentioned renegotiation. That is a very dangerous road to follow for the simple reason that if you allow renegotiation for one country today you will have to do the same for another country tomorrow.  When the precedent is set one becomes a hostage to fortune. That is not the way to go about it and should not be talked about.  If there is one aspect which is seriously meritorious about the whole concept of EMU it is the concept that everybody moves forward at the one pace.  That is not to assume for one moment that there will be considerations in respect of individual countries.  The European Central Bank and those in control must be responsive to the needs of all Europeans, not one group, or one country at a particular time.</P>
    <P>Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been the engine driving the European movement for several years.  There are those who will decry that, for various reasons.  I hope this will continue and that he will continue in that vein.  If not, the alternatives are not those we would readily contemplate. It is not true to say that whether we join EMU, whether we integrate or whether we continue in the same vein as in the past number of years that Europe will be all right.  There are disruptive forces in the field but, unlike my colleague, Deputy Gormley, the way to resolve those problems is through European integration, including economic and monetary union.  That is very important. Deputy Gormley referred to those who said no to devaluation in 1992-3.  My party leader said yes, agreed to devaluation and we are now saying yes to EMU.  What the Deputy has said is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always something we have in common with each other, it is just a matter of sorting it out.  I think we will eventually go down the road of tax harmonisation, but not for some time.  There has to be a gradual process. Something which will affect economic and monetary union and our economic and political cohesive approach will be the way in which the political system works in the respective countries.  For instance, we do not have elections on the same day, there are arguments for and against that. There is merit in having them at different times <Col N="1171" /> and during different periods of Government throughout the Union for the reasons already given.  EMU will deter political parties and governments from entering into the bargaining, the Dutch option position before elections.  Each political party, large or small, will have to have regard to the criteria laid down and the direction in which we are going and will have to measure up to it.  I am not so sure it will be a good idea in future for newspapers to publish the day before the election that it is payback time or some similar banner headline.  Those people will have to have regard to the criteria laid down by EMU.</P>
      <P>It is not only in recent times that newspapers began to enter that arena.  I will always remember 1977 which has certain similarities with the present day in relation to inflation.  A few days before the 1977 general election there were banner headlines in a major national newspaper which said &ldquo;Banks say Fianna Fáil deal is on&rdquo;. That was very encouraging for the party in Opposition but it had little regard for the good of the country in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within two years of the Fianna Fáil party going into office at that time inflation rose to 21-22 per cent, interest rates increased to 21-22 per cent, all the ingredients for catastrophe which we spent the next ten years paying for.  I hope we will not go down that road again.</P>
      <P>I refer to a matter raised by Deputy Rabbitte. A number of people are concerned at the inflationary pressures in the economy, not because of EMU but because of internal decisions made here.  The single biggest factor governing the lives of most people here is their right to own a home.  There are people who, a year ago, were able to bid £60,000-£70,000 for a house.  They now must bid up to £140,000 or £150,000.  That means that a young Garda, doctor, nurse or teacher, not to mention a person in the wider Civil Service, is not able to buy a home. That is a serious matter.  It has not yet percolated through the respective Government ministries.  If something is not done about it soon, there will be inflation of the order of inflation in 1977 and thereafter.  If the Members opposite think I am codding, they should visit some of the constituencies where this is happening.  I have never had more young people attend my clinics at weekends crying out for houses.  The Government's job is to identify the potential for these things to happen and to find out how it can resolve problems. There are ways and means of doing so.  One factor about which nobody seems to have thought is that in the past three years an extra 40,000 people who have jobs are in the marketplace looking for houses, services and goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will also recall that over the past ten years we have all become tired of listening to experts telling us that most schools would close because there would be smaller families.  The 2.4 <Col N="1172" /> children average would fall to 1.8, 1.7, etc., and eventually there would be schools to burn. Governments went along with that because it meant they did not have to invest in education but they were wrong.  Nobody has come forward now to say their projections were wrong, the schools are still full and there is still a high pupil-teacher ratio.  In five or ten years they will be shown to be even more wrong because demand will become greater.  It appears that the economy will continue to prosper.  We should not be surprised at that.  For a long time the economy was in a bad state and was dependent on one neighbouring state.  That is no longer the case and that is an illustration of the benefits of dealing in the wider arena with more competitors in a more open market.</P>
    <P>Ireland can benefit a great deal from EMU and all the other aspects of European integration to date but there is still a long way to go.  The people have not yet tested the full strength of the economy. It will unfold in time.  I will be disappointed, if in four or five years Members still here will not be able to look back and say joining EMU was a great decision.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to compare too often or readily with the US.  However, there is something to be said for a continent where about 260 million people enjoy the same currency.  They do not have exchange rates.  They need not pay somebody to change money to another currency or coin.  They have enjoyed that facility for a long time.  Their currency has proven by its durability that there must be some merit in it.  How could the system continue in Ireland or in the other member states where if one took £100 pounds, travelled the 15 member states and changed the currency at each airport, one would end up with nothing?  Obviously there is a huge cost to industry in that area.  Deputy Gormley referred to the insignificance of the smaller countries but I do not accept that.  The smaller countries have far greater influence and strength in the European Union within EMU than they could ever have as individual players in the wide, open and often rough economic playing fields.</P>

      <P>The decisions which were taken by the European leaders on 1 May last have finally given the green light to the introduction of a single European currency in 11 member states on 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear and unequivocal about the magnitude of the changes which will be brought about by the new euro currency.  Eleven countries will sign up to this new currency from its inception, with four EU member states remaining outside the euro zone.  I will refer later to the likely consequences for Ireland of Britain remaining outside <Col N="1173" /> the process of economic and monetary union for the time being.  It is important that we detail the timeframe for the introduction of a new European single currency for covering a population of more than 290 million people.  On 1 January next, a new European monetary policy will begin under the auspices of the European Central Bank headed up by a Dutchman, Mr. Kim Duisenberg. The power of the new European Central Bank must not be underestimated.  This bank will control the setting of interest rates within the euro zone, taking away this power from national central banks.  I will refer to the effects of this later.</P>
    <P>Between 1 January 1999 and 1 January 2002, the euro currency will be in existence in non-cash format only.  This means that cheques, as well as the processing of bank drafts and bank transfers, can be written in the euro currency.  On 1 January 2002, the euro currency will come into existence in cash format and euro notes and coins will come into daily circulation.  Between 1 January 2002 and 1 July 2002, national currencies will be in circulation with the euro currency.  On 1 July 2002, all tender relating to national currencies will be withdrawn leaving only the euro currency in operation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent setting up of the National Changeover Board which is set to advise the Government on the contentious aspects of introducing the new currency.  I strongly urge the National Changeover Board to ensure that comprehensive and widespread information campaigns are held so that people are aware of the real value of the euro currency compared to the pound.  We are fortunate in Ireland from one perspective; we have recent experience of changing currency when decimalisation was introduced. We must learn from the mistakes of that time and ensure that such errors do not recur.  Information through dual pricing campaigns is the key to guaranteeing that no confusion arise in the minds of people who are set to use the new currency and this must particularly be the case with regard to older people.</P>
    <P>I have been in business for many years and I can only urge businesses to start the process of preparing for the new euro currency now.  Economic and monetary union means that companies must review all their internal operations to ensure a smooth transition to the new currency.  All aspects of one's business operations must be reviewed from the accounting, purchasing, marketing, production management and training areas.</P>
    <P>In assessing how accounting procedures for a company will change as a result of the new euro currency, the following matters would arise: the choice of changeover times for accounting systems; the need to interface with suppliers and customers; treasury management issues; banking services requirements; the implications of the changeover for training; budget planning for the changeover; and cash handling operations, including the preparation of the new euro notes and coins.  The Government must play its part in <Col N="1174" /> informing Irish business of these likely changes. Other organisations such as IBEC, Forbairt and local chambers of commerce must continue their good work in ensuring that businesses are fully prepared for the new European currency.</P>
    <P>From an Irish perspective, it is important that we join the new European currency at the earliest opportunity.  The Economic and Social Research Institute came to the same conclusion when commissioned to carry out an in-depth study of the likely sectoral impacts of the single European currency in Ireland, even if Britain opted out of EMU.  The ESRI concluded that it was in Ireland's medium to long-term interests to join the single currency at the earliest opportunity.  It stated that as an exporting country it would be foolish not to take advantage of a European trading zone comprising 290 million people where there will be a complete elimination of transaction costs for export and import of goods and services as a result of the new currency arrangements.</P>
    <P>The arrival of the new currency will result in a reduction in interest rates which will be good news for homeowners and people involved in small and medium sized companies.  Lower interests are good news in general for the economy. However, we must ensure that prices remain stable so we can guarantee that our national economy remains competitive and that inflation does not begin to venture into its workings. The new European Central Bank will set interest rates in the euro zone and it will not change that rate for Ireland if inflation begins to creep into the economy.  For this reason we must be doubly careful to continue to run the economy in an extremely sensible manner.</P>

      <P>I send my sincere congratulations to Mr. Gerard Collins, MEP, on his election as Vice-President of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998, another landmark in the process of European integration.  It gives us an opportunity to welcome Ireland's participation in EMU and the single currency.  Credit is due to the Government and its predecessors for not seeking, as did the UK, an opt-out clause from the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty relating to EMU and for ensuring that we met the Maastricht conversion criteria and qualified for membership of this exciting project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EMU will involve 11 countries, a population of 300 million people, the second strongest world currency next to the US dollar in the second largest economy in the world.  As other Members stated, the project is politically driven but it makes good economic sense.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the Minister should have shown a greater sense of history in his contribution.  His speech, like the Bill, was extremely technical in nature and I believe we have a duty to appreciate the historic nature of events surrounding EMU and the single currency.  Many benefits will accrue <Col N="1175" /> from membership of EMU.  For example, there will be a reduction in interest and inflation rates in the long term, an elimination of exchange risks in trading with Europe, a reduction in foreign exchange transaction costs, easier comparability of market prices across Europe, dealings with end customers on the Continent will be simplified, etc.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to comment on the recent vote on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Much has been said about the high level of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the referendum on the treaty.  In 1972, 83 per cent voted in favour of EEC membership; in 1987, this figure decreased to 70 per cent in respect of the Single European Act; in 1992, it decreased further to 69 per cent in favour of the Maastricht Treaty; and in 1998, it decreased again to 62 per cent in respect of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The political establishment in Ireland and the EU must assess this trend.  However, I suggest there is no need to become hysterical about it. One thing is clear: the Irish people do not wish to become involved in a military alliance.  There is also no support for federalism and any further European integration will have to be clearly justified.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the people believed they did not receive enough information in respect of the issues surrounding the Amsterdam Treaty.  The fact that it is a complex and legalistic document did not help.  Traditionally, the Irish have seen the EU as an endless source of funds and the begging bowl image was predominant.  However, new-found prosperity and confidence have resulted in our casting aside our national inferiority complex.  Europe is no longer perceived merely as a gravy train.  Voters want to examine the issues in greater detail, they expect involvement and accountability and they do not want the EU to be remote or elitist.</P>
    <P>The challenge for Members will be to raise interest in European affairs and ensure that all the issues are adequately debated.  The discussion can no longer be confined to the amount of &ldquo;dosh&rdquo; we receive from the European Union. Much as I regret Deputy Gormley's doom and gloom comments, I accept that he is contributing to a much needed national debate on European issues.  If one thing emerged from the vote on the Amsterdam Treaty it is that people want to debate the issues and they require full information.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European Central Bank and the new role of the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, will the Governor be a free agent at European level in respect of his decisions and to whom will he accountable?  I do not believe he will be accountable to ECOFIN.  We must consider recent decisions regarding the managerial team of the European Central Bank and the failure to have a senior Irish professional appointed to it.  Members of the public want these issues to be addressed and they want to ensure that the <Col N="1176" /> European Central Bank is accountable and transparent.</P>
    <P>What will be the role of the commercial banks in this process and what criteria will be used <i>vis-à -vis</i> the conversion of Irish punts to the euro and <i>vice versa</i>?  We have been informed that the conversion will be carried out free of charge. However, cynical members of the public are seeking guarantees in that regard.  They are also eager to discover how the banks intend to recoup the money spent on this process.  Will they increase charges elsewhere in their system to compensate? Most people are of the opinion that the banks are only interested in profit and they do not believe that these services will be provided free of charge. Assurances are required in that regard.  Consumers are also seeking assurances that they will not be ripped off when euro notes and coins become available in 2002 as they were when decimalisation was introduced.  Information must be provided in respect of the methods that will be used to ensure that consumers are not ripped off.</P>
    <P>With regard to the withdrawal of our existing currency in 2002, some time ago serious complaints were made about the state of Irish banknotes, particularly the £5 note, which tends to become extremely grubby and unhygienic.</P>

As the year 2002 approaches, I hope the Central Bank will not wait to recall these banknotes and that, despite the deadline for the introduction of euro notes and coins, new notes will be printed.  We should commemorate 1 January 1999 and 1 January 2002.  It is a politically driven and historic occasion which should be commemorated in an appropriate way.  The public needs to be fully engaged in the process of the changeover.  We do not want members of the public to say they knew nothing about it.  An important public information programme is to get under way and I am aware agencies are in place to implement it.  We must ensure the public supports passing this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only offer a preface to what I intend to say in more detail on the next available opportunity to debate the economy.  I profoundly disagree with Deputy Durkan's view that there are matters which should be removed from the realm of the political and given a neutral economic construction.  That is the root of the considerable public disquiet on the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty, where people were of the view there was a considerable amount of bad faith.  For example, in the two previous treaties which established the market and removed the impediments to a free market people thought that, with the removal of State inhibitions to the free market place, the problems of concentration of ownership and oligopoly, both internationally and economically, would be addressed.  We all <Col N="1177" /> know the direction on that has been put on the back burner.  People have asked me repeatedly if this is what they voted for.</P>
      <P>The root of this is a discourse that suggests the problems in the economy are due to political activity.  Yet, we are debating a Bill in Parliament in a short period.  It is profoundly anti-democratic for those who argue that there should, for example, be statutory or constitutional limits on growth.  I read this view in the most recent article in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> by Gerry Boyle who wrongly claims there were pressures on the last Government which made it impossible to curtail spending.</P>
      <P>As someone who taught economics 30 years ago I am aware there is nothing wrong with economics as a science.  The problem is with the version of economics.  Some economists who contribute to the international world of economics, led by people like John Kenneth Galbraith, speak of how economic growth can be enhanced by changes in mechanisms of redistribution and that redistribution can create rather than inhibit growth.  Yet, that discourse never penetrates what is read here.</P>
      <P>I could only describe what Professor Brendan Walsh wrote recently, which was later corrected, as the view of the Dublin school of economics and supported by those like Moore McDowell, who refers to the ordinary citizen as Joe Sixpack. While it could perhaps be misconstrued unfairly it would not be too wrong to say the argument built around the wage aspirations of building workers and those who have not participated in growth is that when the largest pigs have been to the trough there must not be anything left for the piglets.</P>
      <P>Some tax reforms have been regressive in character and widened the gaps in income and in participation in society.  It is monstrous to suggest that such political considerations, which might reflect democratically the feelings of the people in Ireland or Europe, should be removed and handed over to a neutral body.  The assumption, based on a fallacy as poverty stricken intellectually as it is unsupported in the theoretical literature in economics, is that the economy is a self regulating mechanism capable of being over heated or cooled down by sets of measures which are not politically accountable.  This is a patent distortion of the work of serious international economists and is theoretically shabby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For this reason I will strongly resist suggestions that politicians do anything other than operate responsibly.  If, for example, people in the political process from whichever side of the House take decisions on public expenditure they are accountable for it.  Equally with regard to management. However, the suggestion that all one needs to do to solve the problems or to cure an inflationary surge in the economy is to remove the political input is as ignorant as it is undemocratic. People are worried about putting a frame of accountability around the new central bank in <Col N="1178" /> Europe.  Perhaps the Minister may address that in his reply.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions and I look forward to further discussions on the Bill on Committee Stage where a number of the issues raised will perhaps be better addressed.  Deputies Rabbitte and Haughey suggested my speech should have mentioned more of the history and politics of the Bill.  EMU was debated in this House and in the Seanad in early April and during deliberations on the Central Bank Bill, 1998, last March. In addition there have been a number of other debates on economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan asked about the length of the period in which the dual circulation of the Irish pound and the euro would last.  The legal framework provides that it can last for at most six months from 1 January to 30 June 2002, but that member states may shorten it.  It is too early to set a date, but section 9 provides for an early operative date to be set by the Minister, by order. However, it is likely that the date set will be a good deal earlier than 30 June 2002 since the main purpose of this period is to facilitate the withdrawal of Irish pound notes and coins.  In addition, other countries are looking at the question of shortening the six months period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan suggested that supermarkets should be used to sweep up existing Irish notes and coins.  A similar exercise took place in the conversion to decimalisation.  The Bill gives the Minister the power to at least leave the option open in this regard.  The job in Ireland will not be as big as in some of the larger countries, which is why the six months period was provided, even though it will be a major operation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the question of the availability of credit cards in euros and whether tourists would be able to use them abroad.  Credit cards are run by international organisations rather than by national ones.  The extent to which they will be available in euros and the timing of that availability will presumably be driven by commercial considerations, especially with regard to the likely extent of demand.  When they are available they will presumably be usable anywhere in the same way as credit cards.  The Deputy may be aware of a recent newspaper report of an Irish based company which claims to have developed the first euro compliant credit card software to the standards of one of the big credit card companies.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Perry's emphasis on the importance of communicating information on the euro to schools.  I confirm my Department is working with the Department of Education and Science on the development of a suitable programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether there will be a national face or feature on euro banknotes is, under the treaty, a matter for the European Central Bank.  My understanding is that euro banknotes will not have any national aspect.  The euro <Col N="1179" /> coins will have one common face and one with a national symbol.  I have already announced that the national side of euro coins issued here will show the 12 stars of the EU flag, the year of issue, the harp and the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked about the switch between domestic and foreign currency debt within the Irish national debt and how the balance sheet would appear.  At present 27 per cent of our debt is denominated in currencies other than the Irish pound.  The precise breakdown constantly changes, but around half of that 27 per cent is denominated in the currencies of participating member states.  Our debt denominated in the currencies of those participating states will become euro debt after 1 January 1999, although still denominated in deutschemark or French franc denominations of the euro.  Consequently, from 1999 foreign exchange risk will no longer arise on this debt.  The reduction in foreign currency exposure will be a welcome development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the question about the share capital structure of companies.  I can confirm that during the transitional period renominalisation of company share capital is optional. The 10 per cent limit mentioned by Deputy Noonan refers to the extent to which a company can adjust its capital when renominalising the nominal par value of shares pursuant to section 26(4)(a).  In other words, the total capital of the company effectively remains the same, but it will now be split between share capital and a capital conversion reserve fund.  A 10 per cent limit on the size of the reserve fund is a requirement of the second company law directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also asked when businesses would be obliged to accept settlement in euro. There is no general obligation in law to accept payment in any form other than in legal notes and coins.  Thus, businesses will be obliged to accept payment in euro notes and coins once they become available on 1 January 2002.  During the transitional period banks will automatically convert payment in euro or in Irish pounds to the currency of the account.  I dealt with that in my Second Stage speech.  Banks will not charge for the conversion.  In other words, the transaction charge, if there is one, will be the same whether the transaction involves a conversion from the euro into Irish pounds or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also raised the question of dual pricing, about which the European Commission issued a recommendation in April.  The Commission favours a voluntary code of conduct in this area.  The Director of Consumer Affairs recently indicated that he agreed with the Commission's view.  The food, drink and tobacco confederation of IBEC has published dual pricing guidelines for the grocery trade which the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs was involved in drawing up.  In addition, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is working with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs on the preparation of a national code of <Col N="1180" /> practice on dual pricing.  There will be full consultation with the consumer and other interests to ensure that code has the maximum support of consumers and retailers.</P>
    <P>As regards any attempt to use the changeover to mass prices, I agree with Deputy Noonan that a very careful campaign of information for consumers will be needed to keep them well informed about the changeover.  There will be three years for consumers to get used to the idea of the euro before euro notes and coins come into use on 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>Retailers know they will have to maintain consumer confidence during the changeover and consumers will be extra vigilant at that time.  Wise retailers will be anxious to demonstrate to their customers that they will implement the changeover fairly and will make a virtue of the fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to an article by Dr. Garret FitzGerald which I referred to on a previous occasion.  As I said previously, we can neither contradict nor agree with him on that matter.  He may be right or wrong, but I agree with Deputy Noonan that we all believe that is what happened then and the customer believes it also.  We should leave it for historians to work out what happened, but I agree with Deputy Noonan regarding the perception.</P>
    <P>Deputies Deenihan and Perry mentioned the Forfás business awareness campaign.  There is a consultative committee which advises the campaign and the committee has representatives from more than 30 organisations including a number dealing with small businesses.  Organisations representing small businesses are very active in distributing the Forfás material to their members and in promoting knowledge of EMU and the euro in other ways.  It is not only Forfás and the representative bodies which are telling companies about the euro, the banks are also actively doing that.  Forfás sent out more than 80,000 copies of a short leaflet to small businesses.  I also mentioned the Forfás campaign leaflet which will be sent to all households.  There is plenty of information available and small businesses which have not yet begun to prepare for this changeover should do so now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan suggested that there should be a fund to help retailers manage the changeover. I referred to this in a reply to parliamentary questions and to questions from the media post ECOFIN Councils.  I have no plan to provide special help for businesses to make the changeover and, as far as I am aware, neither has any of other ten countries in the euro eleven nor is it their intention to so do.  Forfás will launch a leaflet especially for retailers in the coming weeks. The leaflet was drawn up in consultation with the Forfás retailers group which includes representatives from a wide range of retail groups.  Forfás will also publish a document on information technology in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte queried whether interest rates must converge.  It is true that the precise timing of interest rates convergence before 1 January 1999 <Col N="1181" /> remains to be determined, but there is no question of any significant interest rate differentials remaining after 1 January 1999.  If depositors in the wholesale banking market were to seek significantly higher rates here, borrowers would go elsewhere to borrow and could do so without any exchange rate risk or legislative constraints.  The rate at which the Central Bank will make funds available here will be determined by European Central Bank guidance.  A single interest rate is an integral part of a single currency.  There will be no mechanism for sustaining significant differentials in a single currency area.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to speculation that the euro bond market will not constitute a friendly environment for Ireland to issue bonds. It is true that the NTMA faces a challenge in seeking to issue Irish bonds into this large bond market, but we can anticipate many substantial advantages for Ireland in that bond market as well as certain difficulties.  One of the main advantages accruing to us in anticipation of monetary union has been the convergence of Irish bond yields towards German bond yields.  This has already provided substantial savings for the Exchequer in terms of its debt servicing cost. Those benefits are being reinforced by votes of confidence in Ireland by the credit rating agencies which have repeatedly improved our credit rating in response to our strong growth performance.</P>
    <P>Regarding the difficulties for any small issuer in this market, we should benefit greatly from having set up the NTMA in 1990.  The NTMA has had the opportunity to build up significant expertise in the marketing of Ireland's debt and it is working actively to ensure that the large European financial institutions are fully aware of the attractiveness of Irish bonds.  It has already begun the process of marketing our bonds and developing the various technical features which will make them competitive.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell asked if cheques in euro will be accepted abroad.  Acceptance of cheques is a matter for the person accepting them.  The fact that a cheque is in euro is unlikely to change other aspects of a retailer's willingness to accept it.  For example, one consideration is whether he knows the person presenting the cheque.  There is no euro-wide clearing system for retail cheques. People travelling abroad would be well advised to consider other options for making payments and getting cash abroad.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies raised the question of sterling. Speculating about sterling is like speculating about the Irish weather.  It is impossible to know from one week to the next what will happen.  At some time in every decade for the past 50 years sterling has devalued.  An example of what has happened sterling in the past six months should teach people how difficult it is to speculate about it.  The value of sterling to the deutschemark increased from DM 2.17 in l995 to DM 3.09 or DM 3.10 a few months ago, but in the past few weeks has fallen fairly steadily to under DM 2.90. In the past ten days it has risen in value and this <Col N="1182" /> evening it is equivalent to DM 2.97. Consequently the value of sterling to the Irish punt has fallen and increased.  There is no point speculating about sterling; we will have to take what happens on the chin.  Most people, including the Governor of the Bank of England, would accept sterling's equilibrium rate and that it would have to fall a long way before it could be regarded as presenting an economic shock.  However, I do not intend to speculate on sterling.  There are other issues which I have not been able to deal with due to time constraints, but I will deal with them further on Committee Stage next week.  I thank Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I hope so.  On 15 December 1995 Neodata Services Limited closed its factories in Kilmallock, with the loss of 36 jobs, and in Newcastlewest, with the loss of 71 jobs.  Neodata owned both premises and subsequently sold them.  There is no indication as to what its premises in Newcastlewest will be used for.  The purchasers in Kilmallock hope an alternative business will be found for the premises.  In a parliamentary reply on the 29 November 1995, the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, indicated that he had directed IDA Ireland to redouble its efforts to find replacement industries for the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What tangible proof can the Minister provide that serious efforts have been made to find alternative industries for Newcastlewest and Kilmallock by the IDA?  Unless both locations receive serious consideration, they will not receive the same attention for industrial development as the Limerick city and Shannon area.  While industrial development is to be welcomed in the region, is there a difficulty in getting extra industry for Newcastlewest given that no industrial unit is available?  What chance does a greenfield project have in that location as far as the IDA is concerned? <Col N="1183" /> If the delay of two and a half years is anything to go by, the chances for an alternative industry are not good.  I hope this is not the case and that the IDA has not forgotten its commitment.</P>
    <P>With regard to Kilmallock, the former Neodata building was purchased with the objective of finding a suitable industry for the premises.  It has been marketed aggressively locally.  I trust the Minister will give a positive assurance that, with the passage of time, the replacement industry commitment will not be forgotten for both towns. It was a harsh Christmas present for more than 100 female workers when the factories closed in December and I look forward to a positive reply.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. However, the Tánaiste is unable to be present. As the Deputy is aware, attracting industry and employment to particular parts of the country is a day to day matter for the industrial development agencies under the aegis of the Department and is one in which the Tánaiste does not have a direct function.  I presume the Deputy is referring to Neodata Services Limited which operated out of Kilmallock and Newcastlewest and which closed in December 1995.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies are committed to securing new investment for Kilmallock and Newcastlewest and every effort is being made to ensure this happens.  The properties in Kilmallock and Newcastlewest have been sold.  The Newcastlewest facility was sold to a local private purchaser and the Kilmallock plant is now owned by a local community group and is currently being refurbished.</P>
      <P>An economic study group was established in Kilmallock to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the town.  The group is chaired by the Kilmallock Traders Association and comprises representatives from Limerick County Enterprise Board, Shannon Development, Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  It appointed consultants to examine all socio-economic aspects of Kilmallock and its environs and involves meeting all interested parties in the area.  A report is due from this group by the end of July 1998.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies continue to promote Kilmallock and the vacant Neodata site.  To date in 1998 there have been three site visits to the plant in an effort to attract new industry and potential overseas investors.  In addition, Shannon and IDA Ireland are actively promoting a 13,693 square foot building at Kilfinane Road, Kilmallock.  At the end of December 1997 there were ten agency-supported indigenous companies in Kilmallock employing 219 people compared with nine companies employing 199 people at December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Neodata site at Newcastlewest was purchased by a private investor and will no longer be marketed by the agencies.  However, Forbairt <Col N="1184" /> actively promotes its technology and innovation services in the Newcastlewest area, especially technology grants, graduate placement programmes and other services as required.  The main thrust of activity to date since the closure of Neodata has been the special training course for ex-employees of the plant.  This training was carried out by FÁS in close co-operation with Shannon Development and IDA Ireland.  Forbairt works closely with Limerick County Enterprise Board and West Limerick Resources in the Newcastlewest area.  At the end of 1997 there were 13-agency supported indigenous companies employing 316 people in Newcastlewest compared with 13 companies employing 343 at December 1996.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure appropriate priority is given to encouraging industrial development in the regions.  I intend to ensure the development agencies under the aegis of my Department carry out their remit in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas CheannComhairle, for permitting me to raise this important matter.  Ireland has a proud and distinguished reputation in the field of international peacekeeping.  Our armed forces can lay claim to a long tradition of active participation in the cause of international peace.  Article 29.1 of the Constitution provides the foundation for this tradition. It states that &ldquo;Ireland is devoted to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations founded on international justice and morality&rdquo;. This ethos led to our membership of the United Nations in 1955.</P>
      <P>Since the late 1980s and the end of the Cold War, the texture of international peacekeeping arrangements has changed dramatically and this change led to the establishment of Partnership for Peace in 1994.  PfP was designed to placate those countries in central and eastern Europe which, fearing Russian instability and possible aggression, were clamouring for NATO membership. However, NATO member states were concerned that a hurried enlargement of the alliance would destabilise Russian politics.  Thus, Partnership for Peace was a compromise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1994 the partnership has evolved into a key European security institution.  It comprises 43 participants, including the 16 NATO member states.  Its primary purposes are the protection and promotion of human rights; the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the preservation of democracy; the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the UN Charter obligation and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  The key question for PfP is its role as part of the emerging security structure in Europe.  Ireland is the only significant country in western Europe which stands aloof from it.  PfP is not a back door to NATO and those who claim it is are simply not honest.  It is for non-NATO <Col N="1185" /> members, some of whom may wish to join NATO, and others of whom have no intentions of joining the organisation.</P>
    <P>Membership of PfP will not impinge on our neutrality.  Several neutral countries are members &mdash; Austria, Sweden and even Switzerland.  Fine Gael advocates membership and we believe support exists for such a step.  An <i>Irish Times</i>/MRBI poll was carried out in September 1996 using a sample of 1,000 people.  When asked if Ireland should join a NATO-led Partnership for Peace, 77 per cent said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, 13 per cent said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and the remainder had no opinion.  The Minister should not fudge this issue by referring to neutrality or a European army.  They have nothing do with this matter.  During the recent Amsterdam Treaty debate there was much scaremongering about such developments.  Military alliances are protective and not aggressive devices.  They seek to prevent rather than engage in hostilities.  How many Europeans died as a result of conflict in the first half of this century?  How may died in the second half?  It is easy to do nothing.  What mechanism can be recommended to address the problems in Kosovo?</P>
    <P>Based on pre-election policy, the Government parties are divided on this issue.  Security is indivisible and conflict, if it arises elsewhere in Europe, will have an impact on Ireland.  The essential advantage of Partnership for Peace is that it can only strengthen our contribution to European security.  It offers us an opportunity to share our strengths with other European states in such areas as training in peacekeeping and an openness in defence policy.  I hope the Government has the political will to make the correct decision and not leave this subject on the back burner for a more creative administration to deal with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  There has been a substantial amount of discussion on this topic in recent years.  The previous Government published a White Paper which devoted space to the issue.  Despite this, there are still misunderstandings and a lack of information about the Partnership for Peace.  It would be useful if I set out briefly what PfP is.</P>
      <P>Partnership for Peace has been one element in the development of new inclusive co-operative security arrangements for Europe.  Launched at the NATO Summit in Brussels in January 1994, in light of an initiative by President Clinton, PfP is a co-operative security initiative with the stated aim of intensifying political and military co-operation in Europe, promoting stability, reducing threats to peace and building strengthened relationships by promoting practical co-operation amongst its participants.  Initially, PfP appeared to be geared to countries aspiring to eventual membership of NATO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>PfP has since been joined by most OSCE countries, including Russia and former Soviet republics, as well as the neutral countries Sweden, Finland, Austria and Switzerland.  Currently, 44 <Col N="1186" /> states participate in PfP.  Each participating country determines the scope and extent of its participation in PfP activities.  While PfP involves voluntary and non-binding co-operation with NATO, it does not entail membership of NATO or NATO's mutual defence commitments.  Participants in PfP subscribe to a framework document which sets out the basic purposes and objectives of the partnership.  The purposes set out in the framework document include the protection and promotion of human rights; rededication to the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights; the safeguarding of freedom, justice and peace; the preservation of democracy, the upholding of international law and the fulfilment of the obligations of the UN Charter and OSCE commitments.</P>
    <P>The objectives of PfP include matters such as democratic control of defence forces, which reflects the initial focus of PfP on the emerging eastern European states.  They also focus on maintaining readiness to contribute to peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN or OSCE and there is a focus on joint planning, training and exercises to strengthen states' abilities to undertake peacekeeping, search and rescue and humanitarian operations.  PfP has recently been complemented by a body known as the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.  This council was launched at a NATO meeting in Sintra, Portugal on 30 May 1997 and includes all members of PfP.  The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council grew out of consultations involving the members of PfP, who felt the need for a new multinational consultation framework at political level which was not limited to members of NATO or the former Warsaw Pact alliance.</P>
    <P>The Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council provides an over arching framework for political and security related consultations and for enhanced co-operation under PfP.  It maintains the approach whereby partners are able to decide for themselves the level and areas of co-operation with NATO.  One of the stated aims of this Council is to provide an expanded political dimension for multilateral consultation and co-operation on a wide range of security and defence related issues, for example, regional matters, arms control and civil defence.  Consultations include the political dimension of crisis management, for example, on future UN authorised operations of the SFOR type.  Membership of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council is open to all OSCE states who have subscribed to the PfP basic document.</P>
    <P>The development of structures such as Partnership for Peace reflects the need felt by some countries arising from the current transitional nature of European security.  The emphasis has shifted away from territorial defence towards the problems of conflict prevention, peacekeeping, crisis management and the security threat posed by international crime.  Similarly, the approach in the Amsterdam Treaty reflects the trend away from territorial defence, with its focus on the Petersberg <Col N="1187" /> tasks of peacekeeping and crisis management.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that no State or institution can by itself deal with the complex and diverse challenges to security of the post-Cold War world. Bosnia is probably the best reflection of the new approach of mutually reinforcing co-operation between a range of institutions: the UN, EU, NATO, Western European Union and Council of Europe.  From the discussions that have taken place, including in the House in recent months, there are widely differing perceptions of the advantages for Ireland of PfP.  In particular, there is concern about engaging in any structured co-operation with NATO.  Some see participation in PfP as a back door to membership of NATO. There is no doubt that some of the states participating in PfP aspire to join NATO.  Equally, it is clear that other states, including our fellow European neutral states, participate in PfP out of a wish to enhance outreach to countries such as Russia and to co-operate in the peacekeeping and crisis management areas.</P>
    <P>For Ireland, with a strong tradition of military neutrality and a commitment to active engagement in peacekeeping and international efforts to support peace and security, our priority will be to play a continued active part in peacekeeping and crisis management under UN or EU auspices.  We remain unconvinced by the arguments that have been made that Ireland should participate in PfP. The issue is a complex one, which requires well informed debate.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs on several occasions indicated his willingness to have a Dáil debate on the issue of European Security Architecture, including the Partnership for Peace, so that the range of views on the issue can be heard.  He has welcomed the interest which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has shown in this area.  I understand the committee will return to the issue in early July. The Minister remains of the view that, in the light of the committee's deliberations and conclusions, an informed and inclusive debate should be held in the Dáil at a time to be agreed by the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for State to the House but I hoped the Minister might have been available.  I accept it is not always possible for a Minister who has a busy schedule to be present.  However, given the context of the decision made by the Minister, perhaps the intervention of the Minister of State, who is a fair minded man and who has a proven track record on agricultural issues, is needed as an adjudicator or independent referee on this issue.  When he considers the points I am about to raise regarding the Minister's decision, he may be in a position to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an undoubted necessity to decentralise the Department of Agriculture and Food from Cork city.  The Minister has committed himself to <Col N="1188" /> it in principle over a long period and I welcome that principle.  However, the decision taken to relocate the office from Cork city to Clonakilty is one with which I, many farming organisations and farmers throughout Cork county do not agree. The most dominant farming organisation, the west Cork executive of the county IFA, has come out trenchantly in opposition to this decision. That decentralisation is necessary is unquestionable. Currently, many farmers travel from the Beara Peninsula and peripheral regions of my constituency to Cork city.  There are parking problems outside Hibernian House in the South Mall and the opening hours of the office are restrictive.</P>
    <P>The decision to relocate in principle is sound. However, Clonakilty has its back to the sea and is not the primary location for a decentralised office.  It would be easy for me as a Deputy in Cork North West to say it should have been relocated to a town in my constituency.  Many people say my home town, Macroom, would have been a suitable centre for the office.  However, I believe on balance that either Dunmanway or, more likely, Bandon has more advantages for a decentralised office and that is where the Minister should have chosen.  Many people are aghast at how he has turned what could have been a major opportunity for favourable publicity into an own goal.  It may be a popular home town decision but the range of opposition is widespread, from prominent farming organisations to individual farmers.  Last Monday I attended a meeting in Blarney which was organised by the Cork central executive of the IFA where this was a talking point for many farmers.  People from Carriganimmy, Coolea, Kilnamartra and places south of Macroom like Kilmichael will be obliged to travel cross-country to Clonakilty rather than on the direct road to Cork city.  These farmers would have been better served if the Minister had left the office in Cork rather than decentralising it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State not to make the knee jerk reaction we anticipate in debates such as this, in which he feels obliged to defend the decision, but rather to think twice.  Perhaps he could give a non-committal reply and reflect on the decision in the cold light of day.  He should weigh up the current inconvenient location in Cork city versus the added inconvenience of the Clonakilty office, and look at the advantages of Dunmanway or Bandon as alternative locations. Perhaps he could also indicate what functions will be decentralised to the new office and what time frame is envisaged.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for raising this issue.  As he mentioned it in a recent debate on agriculture, I am glad of the opportunity to assure him that the decision to relocate part of the Department offices from the centre of Cork city to Clonakilty was not taken lightly.  For some months now my Department has been examining the issue and services to farmers are <Col N="1189" /> being monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.  However, regardless of the location of any office in a county, there will still be herdowners located at comparatively adverse distances <i>vis-à-vis</i> their fellow herdowners.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with Deputy Creed.  He called me a fair minded man &mdash; so is he, and an intelligent politician.  I am glad he was made his party's spokesman on food, as that makes him my opposite number.  However, there is some significance in the absence of Deputies Sheehan and Jim O'Keeffe &mdash; I think it means they welcome this decision in their constiuency.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and many other areas, especially peninsular areas, have faced round trips of hundreds of miles to do agriculture business in the centre of Cork city.  As the Deputy is aware there are additional traffic and parking problems when they reach the city.  The good work of the Celtic tiger has brought business and there are traffic jams as a result.  It is a huge centre of commerce and development.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, comes from that area and I would love to do for my area what he has done for his.  He has placed the calf register in Bandon and provided 45 jobs.  He provided the national animal breeding system under Dr. Wickham, a New Zealander, whom I congratulate on his appointment.  That means more jobs for Bandon, so that town has got its fair share.

      <P>It is not.  I have emphasised on a number of occasions recently &mdash; as late as last week in this House &mdash; the importance I attach to quality in the delivery of departmental services. On 14 May I launched a customer service action plan for my Department, which commits it progressively to improve the already high-quality services provided.  I do not propose to repeat what I said several times in this connection, but it is relevant to remind the Deputy that one of the primary attributes of a quality service is accessibility to clients.  My main concern in relation to the Cork offices has been to ensure that this attribute becomes real.  The farmers of Cork are at a significant disadvantage as regards the distances they must travel, the virtual non-availability of parking, and so on.  My intention is that the move to Clonakilty will ease these difficulties considerably for a large number of farmers.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  I also thank the Minister for coming here to deal with this important matter. The parents and board of management of Ballyferriter national school are concerned that one of their teachers has been put on the panel.  The school is only one child short of the required number and pupil numbers for the coming year are good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Gaeltacht areas, some children only have Irish as a family language, other children have various standards of fluency in Irish, some have an understanding of it, others have only a few words, and some have no knowledge of it and only know English.  The Minister can appreciate <Col N="1191" /> that this means an extra workload on teachers in such schools.  The teachers in this school would, therefore, be under severe pressure if the fourth teacher left it would cause serious difficulty to the school, its staff and its pupils.  I am also concerned about the effect of the loss of a teacher on pupils whose grasp of Irish is weak.  This will also have implications for the strength of the language in Ballyferriter.</P>
    <P>This school has a special case and I implore the Minister to ensure the teacher is retained.  We in this House are convinced of the need to preserve the Irish language and of how important it is to all of us. Teachers in schools such as Ballyferriter play a vital role in keeping our first language and they deserve the Minister's support.  I pay tribute to all teachers who do an excellent job in difficult circumstances in communities throughout this country for the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the House on the situation in Ballyferriter national school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the manner in which the staffing allocation for primary schools <Col N="1192" /> is determined.  The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government and the INTO, and has been the situation for many years.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of Ballyferriter national school on 30 September 1996 was 94 pupils.  This enrolment warranted a staffing of a principal and three assistants for the 1997-8 school year.  Additionally, the school has the services of a shared remedial teacher.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the enrolment of the school on 30 September 1997 had fallen to 86 pupils.  This latter enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and two assistants for the 1998-9 school year.  An enrolment of 87 pupils would have been required on 30 September 1997 to retain the third assistant teacher.</P>
    <P>I have requested a member of my Department's inspectorate to visit the school, as a matter of priority, in order to investigate the staffing needs of the school for the 1998-9 school year and report back to me on the issue.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 June 1998.</P>

      <P>Since I last briefed the House on 6 May, the work of the centre has been progressing.</P>
      <P>In the private sector, the first of a series of seminars on partnership at enterprise level was held on 9 June at the Industry Centre, UCD.  The seminar was well attended by employers, trade union and employee representatives and included presentations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and the Irish Productivity Centre. Initial feedback on the seminar has been positive and similar seminars are planned for other regions over the course of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a joint IBEC/ICTU project &mdash; Partnership in Action at Enterprise Level (PACT) under the EU ADAPT initiative &mdash; is about to commence.  Under the project, eight teams are being established on a regional basis. Each team will be made up of management and employee representatives from selected companies, an IBEC executive and a trade union official. They will be assisted by facilitators and a research consultant.  The teams will assess and survey their own needs and the needs of the companies involved in order to develop enterprise partnership. They will be given the training and development to satisfy those needs and to equip them <Col N="1195" /> to develop partnership in their enterprises.  The objective is that the teams would act as catalysts and facilitators for other enterprises in their region.  In addition, training tools will be prepared to support the dissemination of partnership which will build on the experience gained by the teams. The project will run to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>With regard to the public sector, as you are aware from my last briefing to the House, Civil Service Departments and offices are now putting their partnership committees in place, in accordance with the General Council Report No. 1331. In the wider public service, I want to see partnership structures in place as soon as possible in accordance with Partnership 2000.  I have asked my Department and the centre to assist in this process.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 34 and 182 of 29 April and 4 May last, respectively, I have established a Steering Committee drawn from a range of relevant statutory agencies and Departments and from the voluntary sector.  As the membership of this group extends to some 20 individuals, representing these agencies and organisations, I will make the names available in a table to be included in the official report of this debate.  This steering group has the following terms of reference: to advise on the consultation process with the voluntary and community sector (and with relevant statutory agencies) in relation to the White Paper; to participate in same (i. e. provide speakers as appropriate) and to mediate and comment on feedback and advise on issues and directions for the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The group has met on three occasions to date with the most recent meeting taking place on 15 June.  As I also indicated in my replies to previous questions, my intention was that the White Paper be published before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>However, at their meeting on 28 May 1998, members of the group expressed concern that this timeframe might be too tight to allow for adequate consultation with the voluntary and community sector.  The group asked that this timeframe be extended for some three months or so, so as to ensure that time is available for the widest range of voluntary and community groups to be involved in discussions and debate about the forthcoming White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have agreed to this request as my primary <Col N="1196" /> concern in the preparation of the White Paper is to ensure that the issues of importance to the voluntary sector are reflected and that there is genuine consultation in this regard.</P>

      <P>As you are aware my Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was made available to the scheme in 1996, and some 15,000 individuals were assisted that year.  In 1997 an initial allocation of £2 million was again made to the scheme. However, I sought and received approval from <Col N="1197" /> Government to allocate an additional £3 million to the scheme, thus allowing the Department to assist some 21,000 individuals in 1997.  A sum of £2 million has again been allocated to the scheme for 1998.  The closing date for applications was 22 May and the regional offices of my Department, who process applications under the scheme, are currently assessing the level of demand.</P>
    <P>The objective of the scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people and a significant number of people have benefited in this regard.  I am anxious to ensure that the scheme remains focused and provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  This review will not be available until later this year.  In the meantime, the scheme is continuing to operate and the question of whether additional moneys should be assigned to the scheme will have to await the completion of the review I have mentioned and in any event would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, provision for the introduction of a public service card was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1998.  The primary purpose of this card is to act as a permanent record of the cardholder's personal public service number (PPSN), facilitating rapid access to a wide range of public services and capable of being used in the future to support the delivery of payments.</P>
      <P>My Department is now undertaking a process of consultation with the other public service bodies specified in the Act to see how best the card might be used to improve the quality of service offered by the State to its citizens.  It will be some time, however, before the card actually comes into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the personal public service number and of the public service card will enable a more efficient sharing of information between Government Departments and agencies in the administration of public services.  This presents a major opportunity to significantly improve the quality of customer service, eliminate wasteful duplication and improve the control of fraud and abuse.  The Act is quite specific regarding the purposes for which information can be shared and the provisions of the Data Protection Act will be <Col N="1198" /> fully applied in the context of any developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>The operation of the card will be subject to monitoring and review by the management group established to promote the integrated social services system (ISSS).  If data protection issues arise, these will be discussed with the Data Protection Commissioner.  The commissioner is empowered to investigate independently any aspect of the use of the card which may be of concern to him.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free TV licence are available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment, and who are living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  This condition is not, however, applied in the case of persons aged over 75 years who are in receipt of a qualifying payment.  They are also available to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type pensions. In addition, widows/widowers between the ages of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>An additional change announced in the budget allows for people who are in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension who transfer to certain other social welfare pensions, for example, widow's and widower's contributory pensions, to retain their entitlement to the free schemes.  This measure extends the current arrangement which allowed only for invalidity pensioners who transfer either to retirement pension at age 65 or to widow's/ widower's contributory pension at age 60 or over, to retain free schemes.</P>
      <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people who were living alone and required additional assistance. However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included.  It is proposed to undertake a review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event the free schemes are reviewed <Col N="1199" /> each year in a budgetary context and the proposal raised by the Deputy, which would involve additional expenditure, will be examined in that regard.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that resources are made available to the Social Welfare Appeals Office to ensure that hearings and determinations are completed quickly; his views on whether the average time of 22 weeks to process appeals is acceptable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Almost 13,000 appeals were dealt with by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 1997.  The average time taken to process all of these appeals was 22 weeks.  This average period includes all phases of appeals including the additional time involved in the determination of appeals where, for example, further investigations have to be made or where adjournments have been sought by the appellant or by the legal representative acting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is a quasi-judicial one and the procedures involved are designed to ensure that every appellant's case gets full and satisfactory consideration.  There is an inevitable time-lag inherent in such a process which is governed by statutory and fair procedure requirements.</P>
      <P>In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of information supplied by the appellant and the Department's deciding officer without recourse to an oral hearing and these would take less than the average time.  Where an oral hearing is required, however, an additional delay is inevitable. While processing times in the Social Welfare Appeals Office compare favourably with international experience in this area, the achievement of improvement in these times is a major objective of the office.  To this end, four additional appeals officers were appointed during the second half of 1997 and this has brought about an improvement in the processing times for appeals so far this year.  However, at all times it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner that is not in conflict with or at a cost to the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the community employment scheme rests with FÁS and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I am advised, however, that there has been no slackening in demand for places on CE schemes.</P>
      <P>The central issue raised by the Deputies relates to those former community employment workers who revert to the live register after completing a period on a CE scheme, and who, by virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit rather than long-term unemployment assistance. As a consequence, they do not have entitlement to the social welfare secondary benefits which are payable only with long-term welfare payments.</P>
      <P>This issue arises as a direct consequence of the extension of class A PRSI to CE workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996. The purpose of that measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the person is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits, including butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance, are payable only with long-term social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or jobstart etc.  It is important to note also that as regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment would continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have explained repeatedly to the House in the past, I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who requalify for unemployment benefit <Col N="1201" /> without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients. The introduction of class A PRSI for CE workers had the effect of placing them in the same position as other insured workers, in terms both of insurance benefits and of liabilities.  It will be appreciated that any concessions in this area could not, in equity, be confined to former CE workers.  By way of illustrating the costs involved, it would cost some £5.4 million to extend entitlement to the Christmas bonus to all unemployment benefit and disability benefit claimants.  Any concessions therefore would carry a high cost and could be considered only in light of available resources and other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1997 Social Welfare Act provided for the introduction of a new means tested sickness allowance scheme.  This scheme will bridge the gap which currently exists in the social welfare code whereby people who are incapable of work due to illness, but do not satisfy the contribution conditions for disability benefit or the qualifying conditions for disability allowance must have recourse to the supplementary welfare allowance to secure income support.</P>
      <P>It had been estimated that this new scheme would, at any given time, provide for the needs of about 3,000 people who were incapable of work and who were in receipt of SWA, with some 13,500 people benefiting in the course of a full year.  However, recent trends would indicate that the number of potential beneficiaries would now be somewhat lower, due mainly to a larger than anticipated move of claimants from SWA to disability allowance.</P>
      <P>It was originally envisaged that the sickness allowance scheme would commence in 1997. However, it has been found that the level of computer systems development work which would be required to introduce this scheme is such that it could jeopardise the critical work which is necessary to ensure all of the Department's computer based payments systems are fully prepared for the year 2000.  In the circumstances, it has been necessary to defer the introduction of the sickness allowance scheme for the present.  The position will be reviewed later this year in the light of progress on year 2000 preparations.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out, however, that all those who would have qualified for the sickness allowance payment are currently being catered for through other social welfare payments, such as supplementary welfare allowance and are not, therefore, losing out financially as a result of the deferred implementation.</P>

      <P>This Government has made it one of its main priorities to reduce the numbers living in poverty in Ireland and to make progress towards a more inclusive society.  On several fronts, my Department is working closely with other Departments and State agencies to develop comprehensive policies that address the problems associated with social exclusion that afflict a significant minority in society.</P>
      <P>Commitment to this approach has been emphasised through the establishment of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, including local development.  The committee &mdash; which first met in October of last year &mdash; meets on a monthly basis.</P>
      <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy, which occupied much of its first year of operation with the establishment of structures to underpin the process, has made encouraging progress, particularly in relation to unemployment.  Already, more than 40 per cent of the unemployment target set in the NAPS has been achieved and I am confident the goal of reducing the unemployment figure to 6 per cent will be achieved long before the 2007 target date.  Recent figures show that unemployment had fallen to 9.4 per cent by March 1998, reduced from 11.9 per cent in April 1996.  Similarly, long-term unemployment had fallen to 5.6 per cent, an encouraging reduction from the level of 7 per cent that existed just over two years ago.</P>
      <P>In relation to income adequacy, 94 per cent of welfare recipients are now receiving at least the minimum payment recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  In fact, the vast majority of people relying on social welfare payments are receiving amounts above those recommended by the Commission.</P>
      <P>Implementation of the NAPS also required relevant Government Departments to produce baseline documents and annual workplans to provide a comprehensive indication of where current policy impacts on social exclusion and poverty. Cross-departmental initiatives arising from the examination of these documents are currently being drawn up.  My Department's baseline document &mdash; which, in effect, is a major social inclusion strategy, together with key action points and possible areas for co-operation on cross-cutting initiatives &mdash; will be published in the coming weeks.</P>
      <P>The preparation of guidelines for poverty proofing major Government policy proposals is currently being addressed in the context of the NAPS and in the context of the provision in Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also recognised by this Government that the involvement, in the NAPS process, of those experiencing poverty and social exclusion is vital if meaningful progress is to be made.  The publication next year of a White Paper on the relationship between the voluntary and community sector and the State will help clarify the nature of such <Col N="1203" /> involvement.  The Combat Poverty Agency has also commissioned a study on consultation mechanisms between the State and the voluntary and community sector.  It is expected that the study will make suggestions on future arrangements in this area.  A steering committee, comprising departmental officials, voluntary and community sector representation, and an independent chair, will oversee the work of this study.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that considerable progress is being made in the drive to reduce poverty and social exclusion.  One cannot, however, be complacent and I, along with my Government colleagues, will continue with the concerted drive we have undertaken in this area.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will recollect that I indicated, in the course of an earlier parliamentary question on this matter, that I had written to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, setting out my views on the question of Family Income Supplement, FIS, payments being assessed as income for the purposes of determining entitlement to local authority rent payments.  I also drew attention at that time to the views expressed on this matter in the course of the Committee Stage debate on the Social Welfare Act, 1998.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, each local authority is responsible for determining its own differential rent scheme within general guidelines.  This issue is one of the issues being considered by my Department and the Department of Environment and Local Government in the context of work being undertaken by the interdepartmental steering group which is charged with overseeing a study of the disincentive effects of secondary benefits and other entitlements.</P>
      <P>This group also includes representatives from other relevant Departments.  The group commissioned independent consultants to examine the effects of secondary benefits on the incentive to take up employment and training opportunities. The draft report submitted by the consultants is currently being considered by the Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the draft report finds that the inclusion of FIS in the income assessment for local authority differential rent has a significant negative impact on families in this sector who are on low incomes and in receipt of FIS.  This is a view I share and I remain hopeful that in the light of the findings of the consultants who have considered this that it will be possible to achieve a more consistent <Col N="1204" /> approach to the treatment of FIS for differential rent purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The question of savings accruing to my Department because of the continuing fall in the numbers on the live register does not arise at this time.  The live register projection underlying my Department's Estimates for 1998 is an average of 232,000.  This average is based on a seasonal pattern where increases and decreases occur at various times throughout the year.  Expenditure estimates for unemployment payments are also based on this pattern.  As actual figures to date for numbers on the live register and for unemployment expenditure are in line with this expected pattern and with overall expectations, no savings in expenditure arise at present.</P>
      <P>When my Department's Estimates are being prepared, savings that arise as a consequence of lower numbers claiming benefit and as a result of other measures, such as control and anti-fraud activities, are incorporated in this process.  In this regard, it should be noted that savings arising from a fall in the numbers of people claiming certain benefits, such as those on the live register, would, in many cases, be counterbalanced by other factors, including increases in the numbers claiming other payments.  For instance, the number of people claiming disability allowance and one-parent family payment has been increasing in recent years.  In addition, as highlighted in the recent Pensions Board Report on the National Pensions Policy Initiative, the number of old age pensioners is set to increase significantly in the coming decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, the achievement of savings resulting from lower numbers claiming benefits does not necessarily mean that my Department has extra money to spend.  These savings are, in many instances, already incorporated in the annual Estimates and budget process when expenditure proposals are set.  However, the achievement of such savings makes it possible for me to provide significant additional support for the less well off in our society without exceeding <Col N="1205" /> the Government's expenditure targets.  For example, I have been able to provide for substantial social welfare increases in this year's budget, including the special £5 increase for old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have also been able to make significant inroads in meeting many of the commitments contained in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy in relation to income adequacy.  For example: the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare have now been exceeded in the case of over 832,000 recipients &mdash; 94 per cent.  The remaining 57,000 &mdash; 6 per cent &mdash; recipients have had their rates increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the minimum CSW rates; the back to work allowance has been further expanded with an increase of 5,000 in the number of places on the scheme, from 22,000 to 27,000.  In addition, the back to work allowance scheme has been extended to four years for all self-employed participants and the family income supplement is being put on a net income basis with effect from October.</P>
    <P>The cost of this year's social welfare budget package is £125 million in 1998 and £225 million in a full year.  This is the largest social welfare budget package in many years &mdash; £11 million &mdash; 10 per cent higher than the budget presented in 1997 by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In addition, arising from savings which accrued in my Department's Vote, the Government was able, towards the end of 1997, to provide a substantial investment of some £6 million to assist many disadvantaged groups, including people with disabilities and older people.  Of this amount, £4.8 million was made available to assist community and voluntary organisations working with people with disabilities and older people to cover a range of equipment necessary to improve their quality of life, including accessible buses, motorised wheelchairs, training equipment, information systems, deaf aids, computers and special beds and hoists.  A further £1 million was provided for grants for community and family resource centres.</P>
    <P>As regards future savings in my Department's Vote, I will be endeavouring to ensure that these, together with the benefits of economic growth generally, are shared with the more vulnerable sections of our society so that all citizens have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in the social and economic life of the country.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare <Col N="1206" /> allowance, SWA, scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.</P>
      <P>The purpose of rent supplements is to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible persons living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  For the purposes of determining entitlement to a rent supplement, rent is defined under the legislation.  The definition excludes any payment made to a landlord in respect of services such as heating, lighting, maintenance, repairs and service charges.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the capital assistance scheme, CAS, capital grants ranging from 90 per cent to 95 per cent are made available by the Department of the Environment and Local Government, through local authorities, to approved voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for persons accepted as qualified for local authority housing.  It is understood that the voluntary bodies are expected to raise the balance privately.</P>
      <P>The CAS scheme and rent supplementation to its tenants were examined as part of the December 1995 Report of the Review Group on the Role of Supplementary Welfare Allowance, SWA, in relation to housing.  It was noted that in addition to the non-repayable capital grants, subsidies were being paid under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988, and SWA rent supplement was paid to the tenants.  In the circumstances, it was decided to set a limit on the amount of rent supplement payable where the tenancy is in accommodation provided under the capital assistance scheme.  This is set at £21 per week for a couple and £19 in any other case.</P>
      <P>While I value the work done by voluntary housing bodies, I have no plans at present to change current legislation as I feel that in the interests of transparency and coherent public policy, State subsidies in respect of these long-term housing needs should be provided in a housing policy context through the local authorities, rather than in income maintenance policy context through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>The project to ensure <Col N="1207" /> that computer systems in my Department are year 2000 compliant is well advanced.</P>
      <P>Preparatory work started towards the end of 1996 with a study to assess the impact of the year 2000 problem.  The project itself, which involved setting up teams of IT and user staff to make and test the necessary system amendments, began in mid-1997.  That work is now 60 per cent complete and I am satisfied that it is on target to finish by the first quarter of 1999.</P>
      <P>In view of the critical nature of this project, it has to be given top priority.  As other projects finished in 1997, the staff involved were moved on to year 2000 compliance teams.  At this stage, practically all computer development staff, apart from those dealing with essential maintenance of production systems, are working on the project.</P>
      <P>The main impact on other work is that the Department has had to put new development work on hold.  The year 2000 project will impact on the timescale for the movement of the Department's older computer systems on to a modern technology platform in order to improve service levels for customers.  However, ongoing service to the public has not been affected by the project. The existing computer systems continue to be supported and maintained on a day to day basis while the year 2000 project is being implemented.</P>

      <P>My Department currently has 30 jobs facilitators operating throughout the country.  Their function is to support unemployed people in seeking job opportunities or opportunities for self-employment and direct them towards the wide range of initiatives and options provided by various Departments and other State agencies.  They are also actively involved with voluntary and community groups working with unemployed people and with local partnership companies in this regard.</P>
      <P>Jobs facilitators are responsible in particular for the promotion of my Department's back to work allowance scheme and since 1993 they have been successful in encouraging over 36,000 unemployed people to take up employment or self-employment opportunities with the support of the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1208" /> Job facilitators form a very effective component of my Department's overall service for unemployed people.  I see the further development of a proactive approach by all those involved in this service to serving the needs of unemployed people as essential to the development of the social welfare system in the future.  I also believe in this regard that my Department's services cannot be viewed in isolation and that, through better working arrangements and co-operation with other State agencies and local and other groups working in this area a better service and a more efficient use of staff and other resources can be achieved.  I have given a high priority to this since taking office.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of reports which have highlighted the importance of appropriate supports for unemployed people wishing to get back to the active labour force and for those who have already done so and which have affirmed important role of jobs facilitators in that regard. I will be keeping the overall staff numbers and their deployment under review to ensure that an effective service continues to be given and available resources are used in the most effective way possible.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is <Col N="1209" /> referring to a situation where the parents of a child are not married to each other.  Existing legislation on registration of births facilitates the inclusion of the father's name on the birth certificate where both parents so wish it.  If the mother of a child wishes to register the father's name without his agreement, she can do so by securing an appropriate court order naming the father of the child.  Likewise, if a father wished to be named on the certificate against the wishes of the mother he could do so on production of such a court order.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the importance of having a record of both parents on the register from the point of view of the child and in the wider social context.  However, requiring under law that the fathers name must be on the birth certificate would be an extremely complex matter with many serious difficulties for which there are no easy solutions.  My Department is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the whole system of registering births, deaths and marriages so that a more modern civil registration system can be put in place to meet current and future needs.  The issue will be examined in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to adopting a families first approach by putting the family at the centre of all its policies.  In line with this commitment and in response to recommendations from the commission the Government has established a new family affairs unit in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and has provided an additional £2.75 million for the development of family services in my Department.

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people, who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of 1997, 10,330 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at a cost of over £37 million.</P>
      <P>Since its introduction in 1990, the allowance has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  As announced in the budget, the weekly personal rate of the carer's allowance has been increased by £5, from £70.50 to £75.50 for those over the age of 66, and £3 for carers under 66 from £70.50 to £73.50.</P>
      <P>The budget also provided for three additional improvements for carers.  The first two of these are of a more technical nature and benefit a small number of people.  These improvements are a disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the maximum level of the old age contributory pension in assessing means and the payment of carer's allowance for six weeks after death to carers whose spouses were not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  The third improvement is the provision of a free travel pass to all those in receipt of carer's allowance in their own right.</P>
      <P>Government policy places an increasing emphasis on the role of community care in supporting people who wish to remain in their own homes and in their own communities.  The informal caring which carers provide is crucial in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is committed to <Col N="1211" /> progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit; and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, an interdepartmental working group with representatives from the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, has been set up by my Department to review the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme, both in terms of its current operation and its future development.  It is also examining the potential for the development of provision for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.</P>
    <P>The review is expected to be completed later this year.  Further developments in the scheme, such as a relaxation of the means testing arrangements, will be considered in the light of the review and in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The social insurance system is central to the provision of social welfare services and to the economic and social life of the country.  I am fully committed to the enhancement and future development of the system.</P>
      <P>The social insurance system plays a key role in the provision of social protection in Irish society. People, when they are economically active, make contributions to the Social Insurance Fund according to their ability to pay and depending on the range of benefits and pensions for which they are covered.  These payments fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and also pay benefits to persons who are not working due to contingencies such as unemployment or illness.  Contributors, accordingly, build up entitlements to various pensions and benefits which are paid to them as of right, without having to undergo a means test.</P>
      <P>Social Insurance Fund expenditure, excluding administration costs, amounted to £1,820 million in 1997.  Of this expenditure, approximately 69 per cent went to pay for retirement, old age, widow's-widower's and invalidity pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> The Government, in its programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, is committed to the development of the social insurance system and to increasing the maximum personal rate of social insurance pensions to £100 per week by 2002.  Significant progress in this direction was achieved in the 1998 budget.  The budget provided for a general increase of £3 per week in all social insurance payments and an overall increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment to all pensioners aged over 66 years.  In percentage terms, the £3 rise represents increases ranging from 3.3 per cent to 4.4 per cent while the £5 rise represents increases ranging from 6.4 per cent to 7.0 per cent.  The overall cost of these improvements in social insurance benefits is £90 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Changes, costing £50 million in a full year, were also introduced in relation to pay related social insurance contributions.  The employee PRSI free allowance was increased by £20 per week to £100 per week.  This directly benefits more than 1,000,000 workers while 60,000 workers earning between £80 and £100 per week are now exempted from making an employee PRSI contribution. The threshold for the lower rate of employer PRSI was also raised by £10 per week to £270 per week.  The employer lower rate now applies to approximately 62 per cent of all employments in the industrial, commercial and services sectors.  These pro employment measures are designed to facilitate entry and re-entry into the workforce by reducing PRSI contributions particularly in low paid employments.</P>
    <P>The social insurance system is founded on long-term commitment by employers, employees, the self-employed and the State.  It plays a major role in income redistribution and underpins solidarity not only between generations but also between those at work and those currently not at work.</P>
    <P>Social insurance benefit levels, the range of benefits provided and the PRSI financing implications of these can only be considered in the context of the overall budgetary situation and the economic climate generally.  I am fully committed to protecting the future of the social insurance system so that it can meet both its short-term and long-term commitments.</P>

      <P>Ratification arises in respect of conventions only. Ireland has ratified the Equality of Treatment (Social Security) Convention, 1962 which is Convention No. 118.  The ratification was registered on 26 November 1964.  The latest report on this convention was forwarded to the International Labour Office in 1996.  Ireland has not ratified the Migration for Employment Convention (revised), 1949 (Convention No. 97), the Social Policy (Basic Aims and Standards) Convention, 1962 (Convention No. 117), the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (Convention No. 143) and the Maintenance of Social Security Rights Convention, 1982 (Convention No. 157).</P>
      <P>It has been the Irish practice to ratify only those ILO conventions where the necessary legal provisions are in place to allow fully for proof of compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland reports each year on a certain number of conventions, which have been ratified by Ireland, at the request of the International Labour <Col N="1214" /> Office.  The office also requests annually a report from this country on at least one convention which has not been ratified and its associated recommendation.  This year reports have been requested on the following unratified conventions and their associated recommendations: Convention No. 97 and its associated Recommendation No. 86 concerning Migration for Employment; the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention (No. 143) and its associated Recommendation (No. 151).  These reports are being prepared at present.</P>

      <P>The report of the high level panel on the free movement of persons &mdash; Veil report &mdash; concluded that most of the legal measures required to make a reality of the right to free movement were already in place but that some flaws and lacunae still existed in the legal framework.</P>
      <P>The right to free movement of workers, as set out in the Treaty, includes the right for any European Union citizen to enter the territory of any member state to work or to look for work.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the Veil report the European Commission presented an action plan to the Council for the reinforcement of free movement of workers which was designed to place the issue within the overall economic, social and political process of European integration.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now produced proposals for the amendment of the Regulations governing the area (Nos. 68/360 and 1612/68) and these are being considered by the technical and advisory committees on freedom of movement for workers.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering, in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the position to be adopted in relation to the changes proposed.</P>

A permit was issued by my Department to this individual valid up to 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, inquiries were made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to an individual bearing the same name. The Minister was informed that the application had been granted.</P>
      <P>However, it then transpired that an error had been made and that the Minister's inquiry actually referred to a different person.  The confusion arose because the two men had the same first and last names.  In fact, the application about which the Minister had been inquiring had been refused. The confusion that arose in this case is regretted.</P>

However, I am willing to give any of them who contacts me or the Department of Foreign Affairs as much assistance as the Constitution and the law permits.

      <P>Human rights are a priority for this Government. This priority is reflected, <i>inter alia</i>, in our commitment to ratify key international human rights instruments to which Ireland is not yet a party. Given the significance of this year for the observance and promotion of human rights, marking as it does the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration <Col N="1217" /> of Human Rights, it is our intention to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment during the course of 1998.</P>
      <P>In order to be in a position to give effect to the convention, it will be necessary, however, to introduce domestic legislation regarding the offence of mental torture.  I have been advised that work is well advanced in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this necessary legislation.  Once this legislation has been passed into law, I will seek Dáil approval for ratification of this important human rights convention.</P>

      <P>In 1985, the UN Commission on Human Rights established an open-ended working group to draft a declaration on the right and responsibility of individuals, groups and organs of society to promote and protect universally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms, otherwise known as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.  Earlier this year, during its 13th session, the working group succeeded in reaching a consensus on the text of such a declaration.  The declaration was adopted during the 54th session of the commission, in Geneva, and will be forwarded to the UN General Assembly for adoption by that body in the autumn.  Its adoption by the commission was welcomed by all those active in the field of human rights as a most fitting way to mark the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland actively participated in the working group and, as a member of the Commission on Human Rights, strongly supported its adoption by that body.  In so doing, the Government acknowledges the commitment and dedication of those persons throughout the world who, either acting individually or as members of non-governmental organisations, devote themselves to the promotion and protection of human rights, often at great personal cost and danger.  The declaration, which recognises such endeavours, should help to protect these individuals as they carry out this important work.  The Government fully endorses the declaration and will actively support its adoption at the General Assembly in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers was opened for signature on 24 November 1977.  The convention is concerned with the legal situation of migrant workers, in particular employment, residence and work permits, family reunifications, working conditions and the transfer of savings, social security and medical assistance.  To date the convention has been ratified by eight of the 40 member states of the Council of Europe.  Ireland has not signed the convention.</P>
      <P>The question of whether Ireland should become a party to the convention is a matter primarily for those Departments with responsibility in this area, in particular the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>There is no formal system of training honorary consuls.  They are experienced professional people who provide consular services for Irish citizens on the basis of comprehensive written instructions and, in most cases, under the guidance and supervision of one of our Embassies. Honorary consuls consult their supervising Embassy or the Department of Foreign Affairs as necessary about how to deal with individual cases. Embassy staff regularly visit honorary consuls in their areas.  Increasingly, employees of honorary consuls are provided with practical training by the relevant supervising Embassy.</P>
      <P>The manual of instructions for honorary consuls includes guidelines relating to assisting Irish people who have been arrested, detained or imprisoned abroad.  Consular officers, including honorary consuls, try to ensure that Irish citizens in such situations have access to legal defence and receive a fair trial under local law and that their basic human rights are not infringed.  As soon as consular officers, including honorary consuls, get to know of the arrest and detention of an Irish person, they are required to visit him or her if he or she desires such a visit.  They are also expected to write immediately to the detained person giving information about local English-speaking lawyers, the legal aid system, the prison regime, entitlement to medical attention, visits, telephone calls, letters, parcels and money transfers, and the services available from the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.</P>
      <P>Honorary consuls and other consular officers must also determine whether the detained person wishes to have a relative or other person informed of his or her situation and, if that is the case, to arrange for the Department of Foreign Affairs to pass on the information.</P>
      <P>The services provided by our honorary consuls worldwide are greatly appreciated and I pay tribute to their dedication and commitment.</P>

      <P>The following are details of voluntary organisations which are funded from the Vote of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Vote for International Co-operation.  From the Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs, £470,000 was provided in 1998 to the Cultural Relations Committee, <Col N="1220" /> which makes grants to give support to Irish cultural activities of excellence in other countries.  In deciding on the activities to be assisted, attention is also given to their potential to promote tourism and investment from abroad.</P>
      <P>The Department makes an annual contribution of £7,000 to the Irish United Nations Association, which is a voluntary organisation whose aim is to promote greater awareness of the UN organisation and its programmes.</P>
      <P>The Department supports the Institute of European Affairs by making an annual £1,000 subscription towards corporate membership.  The institute aims to provide an independent forum for the development of Irish strategic policy responses to the process of European integration through research, publications, expert working groups, briefings and seminars.  The institute's activities have been of general benefit to this Department and its publications are made available to missions overseas.</P>
      <P>The Department supports the work of the European Movement, Ireland &mdash; formerly known as the Irish Council of the European Movement &mdash; through an annual grant in aid.  A grant of £7,000 was made in 1997 and a similar allocation is provided for in 1998.  The European Movement disseminates information to the public about Europe and has developed a network of nine branches around the country which work to raise awareness of EU issues.  It also hosts public briefing sessions on issues of interest on the European agenda.</P>
      <P>A total of £252,000 was provided in grants this year to organisations promoting reconciliation and mutual understanding between North and South or between Britain and Ireland &mdash; the Reconciliation Fund.  The 1998 grants were made last month.  The allocations made to individual organisations are set out below.</P>

    <P>From the Vote for International Co-operation, in 1996, the latest year for which figures are available, a total of £17.32 million &mdash; equivalent to 15 per cent of total overseas development assistance &mdash; was provided by the Department to non-governmental development organisations.  The main recipients were Concern, Trócaire, GOAL, Oxfam, Christian Aid and the member organisations of the Irish Missionary Union.  The funding was in respect of support for development activities carried out by the organisations concerned in developing countries.  Full details of the funding provided in 1996 are outlined in the annual report entitled Ireland's Official Development Assistance 1996.</P>
    <P>The level of funding provided for non-governmental organisations in 1997, subject to final audit, was £18.3 million.  Full details of the funding for 1997 are in the course of preparation and the Department will be happy to make this available to the Deputy when the 1997 annual report is published next month.</P>

    <P>The Government provides support for the maximum number of family farms through actions to maintain farm incomes.  Direct payments to farmers under schemes funded by the EU and the national Exchequer now account for 47 per cent of farm income.  Measures to encourage the early transfer of land to young trained farmers, such as the farm retirement scheme and generous tax incentives, also make an important contribution to improving farm viability.</P>
    <P>Off-farm rural development is a vital factor in maintaining the rural population.  The success of the Leader programme has shown the enthusiasm of rural communities for direct involvement in the development of their own areas.  In recognition of the importance of rural development, the Government is in the process of preparing a White Paper on Rural Development.  The intention is that the White Paper will address rural development as a broad multifunctional process involving the economic, social, cultural and environmental conditions which influence the quality of life of rural communities.</P>

      <P>Under the rural environment protection scheme, it was possible to claim a destocking payment where the agri-environmental plan provided for a reduction in stock numbers below the lesser of the quota rights owned or actual numbers in 1995.  In this case the owned quota was reduced from 600 to 200, a reduction of 400 ewes, and the destocking premium was therefore calculated on that number.</P>

The scheme was mainly targeted at the number of cereal and other crop growers whose main source of income was from arable crops, potatoes, horticultural crops and grass seed, and where the crop losses arising from the severe weather conditions in 1997 seriously threatened the viability of the farm.</P>

      <P>As a group, farmers who are not registered for VAT are compensated for the VAT borne on their farming inputs in accordance with a special mechanism provided for in the EU Sixth VAT Directive. The current flat rate of VAT refund provided for under this mechanism is 3.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Sixth VAT Directive specifically rule out using the flat rate scheme for any purpose other than to compensate farmers for the VAT borne on farm inputs.  As the provision of self-catering cottages is not farming, the flat rate scheme cannot be used to allow recovery of VAT.  The Directive would also rule out direct recovery of VAT inputs on holiday accommodation &mdash; such as applies in the case of farm buildings &mdash; other than through the normal VAT system, which involves registration for the purpose of charging the tax.</P>
      <P>Where farmers engage in the business of providing holiday accommodation, they must register and charge VAT if the turnover from such business exceeds the annual threshold of £20,000. However, like any other business, such persons have the option to register even if the turnover is below this threshold.</P>

      <P>In response to representations from farming organisations, section 659 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 introduced an improved capital allowances scheme for farmers who incur expenditure on necessary pollution control measures.  The scheme applies for three years from 6 April 1997 to 5 April 2000.  A special year 1 allowance of 50 per cent of expenditure incurred up to an expenditure limit of £20,000 was provided for with the balance of the expenditure to be written off in accordance with the normal wear and tear capital allowance rules, namely, 15 per cent per annum for six years and 10 per cent in the final year. Section 38 of the Finance Act, l998, improved the relief by increasing the annual expenditure limit from £20,000 to £30,000 with effect from 6 April 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the scheme, a farmer must have a farm nutrient management plan in place.  This must be drawn up by an agency or planner approved by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The plan must be either in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department or else accord with a plan drawn up under the Department's <Col N="1227" /> rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; or Erne catchment nutrient management scheme and a copy must be lodged with the Department.  The expenditure must be incurred on buildings or structures specified in the legislation and these must be certified by the approved agency or planner who has drawn up the farm nutrient management plan as being necessary for the control of pollution.</P>
    <P>Section 268 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 includes in the definition of an industrial building or structure a building or structure in use for the purposes of the intensive production of cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry or eggs in the course of a trade other than the trade of farming.  These buildings qualify for annual writing-down allowances of 10 per cent.  This relief has been available since 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to introduce plastic medical cards was made by the chief executive officers of the health boards following consideration of the report of the medical card review group.  This is a separate group to that established consequent to the commitment in the programme for Government &mdash; An Action Programme for the Millennium &mdash; to review medical card eligibility for large families and the elderly, which recommended the use of smart card technology to replace the existing paper cards in order to reduce the cost of illegible prescriptions, estimated to amount to approximately £10 million per annum.  The introduction of plastic medical cards is phase 1 of that process.</P>
      <P>The General Medical Services (Payments) Board at the request of the chief executive officers of the eight health boards undertook to make arrangements for the issue of laminated medical cards to the entire national population of approximately 1.2 million eligible cardholders.</P>
      <P>In compliance with the relevant EU public procurement directives, the GMS (Payments) Board invited tenders for the supply and delivery of laminated cards.  As a result of that process, two orders for contracts were placed: one for the supply of the cards and the second for the personalisation and mailing of the cards.  The total final costs for the Western Health Board are not yet available as the GMS (Payments) Board is awaiting invoices in respect of certain aspects of the contract only recently completed.  However, an approximate figure would be in the region of £45,000, excluding postage costs of about £96,000. The GMS (Payments) Board has agreed to meet all costs associated with the changeover.</P>
      <P>The WHB made the decision to replace its medical card system towards the end of 1997 with a view to ensuring that that system and the hospital systems would be compatible.  The replacement system will also deal with the Year 2000 compliance problem.  Following the appointment of a supplier of the new medical card system, the decision was made by the WHB that the new system should be in place by end March or early April of this year.  Accordingly, when a schedule of implementation dates for issuing the laminated medical cards was being prepared the WHB requested the GMS (Payments) Board to allow it be the last health board to issue the new cards.  This was done by the WHB in order to ensure that the new medical card system would not be introduced at the same time as the introduction of the laminated medical cards and was based on the WHB's experience of implementing new computer systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further time factor involved was that at the time of implementation, the Midland, Mid-Western and Southern Health Boards all shared the same medical card system.  That common system had to be amended and the implementation schedule was adjusted to recognise this.  In addition, there was a need to change the schedule <Col N="1229" /> to accommodate implementation in the MHB area.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary Question No. 212 relates to long-term foster care and informal adoption arrangements which did not come under the Adoption Act, 1952.  My Department currently holds two files relevant to the boarding out of children: other files &mdash; 57 in total &mdash; have been transferred to the National Archives.</P>
      <P>With regard to Parliamentary Question No. 216, as indicated in a previous reply responsibility for the registration of homes under the Registration of Nursing and Maternity Homes, Act, 1934 rests with the health boards.  Consequently this information was sought from them. However, a number of boards have indicated considerable difficulty in gathering this information as some records were not transferred from the relevant local authorities which were responsible for the maintenance of the register prior to the establishment of the boards. However, arrangements are being made to have the information gathered to date forwarded to the Deputy immediately.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined the replies to the previous parliamentary questions referred to by the Deputy I am at a loss to understand their relevance to the information now being sought.  As I have explained on earlier occasions, statistical data relating to adoption is a matter for the Adoption Board.  I understand that this information is contained in the board's annual reports <Col N="1232" /> from 1985 onwards and I have asked the registrar of the Adoption Board to forward the details to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, information on the number of orders which were granted in respect of children born outside the State prior to 1985 is not readily available.  Due to pressure of work it is not feasible to allocate the board's limited staffing resources to going through all the individual files in order to extract the relevant details.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently received approval from the Department of Finance for the appointment of extra staff to the child care area of my Department. This includes six posts to establish a division dealing specifically with the preparation of legislation in the child care and adoption area. The preparation of the legislation to enable the State to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption is complex and it is difficult <Col N="1233" /> to give a precise timescale at this stage. However, the matter is being afforded a high priority.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to consolidate our existing adoption Acts.  However, the two priorities in regard to adoption legislation are the preparation of legislation to provide a framework for post adoption contact and legislation to enable ratification of the Hague Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Statutory responsibility for water management and protection, including responsibility for monitoring water quality, rests primarily with local authorities.  Mayo County Council, a statutory pollution control authority, has the primary responsibility for the protection of water resources in the River Robe area.  The Environmental Protection Agency has responsibility both in so far as activities licensable by the agency are concerned and as part of its overall responsibility for the preparation and implementation of environmental monitoring programmes.  Extensive statutory powers are available under the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990 and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 to support these bodies in their roles.</P>
      <P>The River Robe is the main feeder stream to Lough Mask.  The Environmental Protection Agency's report Water Quality in Ireland 1991-1994, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, indicated that the River Robe was moderately polluted and hypertrophic below the towns of Claremorris, Ballindine and Ballinrobe but that the situation in the lower river should be rectified by a proposed new treatment plant for Ballinrobe sewage.  The report also indicated that Lough Mask was oligotrophic, that is, unenriched and that no recent change had been detected in water quality in open water.</P>
      <P>The Ballinrobe sewerage and sewage disposal scheme, costing £11 million approximately, became operational in mid-1995 and this together with the smaller Hollymount scheme, also provided in 1995, has been of benefit to the water quality of the River Robe.  The Environmental Protection Agency's monitoring results provided to Mayo County Council for 1996 indicate a significant improvement in overall water quality in the River Robe.</P>
      <P>My Department recently approved Mayo County Council's proposal to have work commenced on a major sewerage scheme at Claremorris, costing £6.7 million approximately, and when the scheme is completed over the next 18 months, it will also lead to an improvement in the quality of the water in the River Robe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Lough Carra-Mask Task Force, which was set up three years ago involving a number of sectoral agencies, including Mayo County Council, is carrying out a full survey of the Lough Mask catchment, including the River Robe, and hundreds of farms have been surveyed in the upper regions of the Robe catchment in the past two years.  This committee will report within the <Col N="1235" /> next 12 months on the status of the Carra-Mask and Robe catchment.</P>

      <P>A key priority, as part of the Government action programme for older people, is substantial social welfare increases, including increases in old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period.  These commitments as with other commitments in the programme for Government will have to be dealt with through the normal budgetary process and in this regard an important step to achieving this objective was taken through the £5 per week increase granted in the 1998 budget.</P>
      <P>This undertaking shows the Government's commitment to older people and is a recognition of both the special place of older people in the community and also of their contribution to the economy over the years.

      <P>The position in relation to the Christmas bonus is that entitlement is confined to recipients of long-term social welfare payments.  Accordingly, recipients of short-term payments, including unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, supplementary welfare allowance and disability benefit, do not qualify for this payment.</P>
      <P>The entitlement to the Christmas bonus of people who return to the live register on completing a community employment, CE, scheme depends on whether they qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit by virtue of paying Class A PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for the extension of Class A PRSI to CE workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system, including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment &mdash; dental and optical &mdash; benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of CE workers and to put them on a par with other Class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of people who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit after a period of CE, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  As unemployment benefit is a short-term payment, persons who fall into this latter category are therefore not entitled to receive the social welfare secondary benefits, which comprise the Christmas bonus, butter vouchers and the free fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for CE workers who requalify for unemployment benefit without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry a high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities. <Col N="1237" /></P>

Refugees are treated in the same way as Irish nationals with regard to the provision of support under the social security system.  It is not possible to identify the precise number of refugees in receipt of a social welfare payment, as my Department does not compile statistics on the nationality of individuals who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  It is estimated that the total number of non-nationals currently in receipt of unemployment assistance is approximately 6,400.  This would include refugees who are entitled to reside and work here but the vast majority would be nationals of other EU countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>): The actuarial review of social welfare pensions, commissioned by my Department, was published in September 1997. The review outlines the projected increase in the numbers of pensioners over the 50 year period from 1996 to 2046.  The review found that while the funding position is relatively stable for the next 20 years, the position thereafter, when a large increase in the older population is projected, cannot and should not be ignored.  The following table sets out the projected numbers of pensioners in the years 2001, 2006 and 2011.  The Government is committed to the development of the social insurance system and to increasing the maximum personal rate of contributory pensions to £100 per week by 2002.  Significant progress was achieved in this direction in the 1998 budget. The budget provided for a general increase of £3 per week in all social welfare payments and an overall increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment to all pensioners aged over 66 years.  The level of increase in social welfare pensions in budget 1998 was well ahead of the expected increase in inflation and the increase in average earnings.</P>
      <P>Securing Retirement Income, the report of the Pensions Board relating to the national pensions policy initiative, was launched by me in May 1998. This report contains wide ranging recommendations regarding future pension provision, including social welfare and occupational pensions.  The report recommends, in relation to social welfare pensions, that consideration should be given to establishing an explicit fund to fund, at least partially, the prospective growth that is expected to occur in social welfare old age pensions.  The report also recommended that the entitlement component of social insurance should be retained, that it would be desirable to increase social welfare pensions, over the medium term, in line with the growth in earnings and that a target rate of 34 per cent of average industrial earnings should form a backdrop to the achievement of the Government's £100 per week target.</P>
      <P>I welcome this report and, in my response of 7 May last, I set out an action plan relating to its recommendations.  My response incudes a commitment to establish an interdepartmental working group to examine the recommendation regarding the pre-funding of future social welfare pensions and reiterates the Government commitment to providing a pension of £100 per week by 2002 which requires further real increases in pension rates.  The action plan, for the first time in the history of the State, sets out a clear Government strategy towards securing the future of older persons in our country.  I am committed to the enhancement and development of the social welfare system and strongly believe that the implementation of this action plan will put our pension system on a sound basis into the next millennium.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>The area (enterprise) allowance scheme was established in 1991 to provide an incentive for long-term unemployed people residing in designated areas of high unemployment to set up their own business with the support of the local partnership company.  Under the scheme, eligible applicants retain 100 per cent of their unemployment payment for 12 months plus secondary benefits.  The allowance has now been extended nationwide.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced in 1993 and provides a three year cycle of support to long-term unemployed people who take up employment or self-employment.  The allowance is at a declining rate of 75 per cent, 50 per cent and 25 per cent of their unemployment payment over the three year period.  In practice eligible people taking up self-employment may qualify for a four year cycle of support under the two schemes.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the area (enterprise) allowance scheme, applicants residing in designated partnership areas have their applications determined by the local partnership company while applicants from non-partnership areas have their applications determined by my Department's jobs facilitators.  In both cases payment is made by my Department.  The allowance is funded by the Exchequer and is monitored by my Department and the partnership companies. There are currently 6,950 people in receipt of the allowance nationwide.  The scope for abusing the scheme once the allowance is in payment is limited and I am satisfied it operates in a satisfactory way.  The back to work allowance scheme has been successful in encouraging over 36,000 people to take up employment or self-employment opportunities.  To date, over 4,500 people have completed the three year cycle of the allowance and initial surveys show that 85 per cent of these have successfully remained in employment after the allowance has ceased.  The average weekly payment is £48.90.</P>
      <P>Statistics in relation to costs and numbers participating in the back to work allowance scheme since 1993 are as follows:</P>
