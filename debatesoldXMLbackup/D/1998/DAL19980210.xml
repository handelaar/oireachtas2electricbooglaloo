      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, taken in his Department to comply with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997; the staffing implications, if any, for his Department of complying with the Act; the cost to his Department of compliance and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A departmental steering committee was established in my Department to oversee the implementation of the Act.  The Department is also represented on the Freedom of Information Interdepartmental Working Group in the Department of Finance, which is co-ordinating the implementation of the Act throughout the Civil Service.  Training is taking place for key decision makers and other staff.</P>
      <P>Substantial staff resources, within existing staff allocations, are being devoted to preparations for the implementation of the Act, but it is not possible to distinguish between these and the activities of the Department, including the GIS generally.  It remains to be seen whether there will be a requirement for additional staff resources or if other expenditure will be required after the Act comes into force.</P>
      <P>My Department is at an advanced stage in the publication requirements under sections 15 and 16 of the Act.  The final cost of these has not yet been ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if his Department has informed all those who do business with it that they are required to preserve and to have available any documents they have in regard to the business they are doing with it for inspection under the Freedom of Information Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it has complied fully and drawn up a list of all those that would be involved.  The Deputy will be aware a number of sections that deal with the Department are not <Col N="1430" /> covered by the Act.  The bodies under the aegis of the Department covered by the Act are the CSO and the Office of the DPP, but the partnership group, the information society, the NESF, the NESC, the LRC and others are not covered. As far as I am aware, it has informed the sections relevant to it.  The central policy unit has also drawn up a comprehensive list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I did not put my question properly.  Is the Taoiseach aware that private businesses doing business with his or any other Department, covered under the Freedom of Information Act, are also obliged to preserve documentation in their care for access under the Freedom of Information Act as distinct from the information available in the Department?  Have those in the private sector generally who are doing business with Government, not only with his Department but with all Government agencies covered by the Act, been informed that these obligations extend to them?  Will the Taoiseach quantify how much training time has been allotted in his Department to prepare for the radical change involved in the implementation of this Act?  Have all staff or only a few key decision makers been trained?  How much time has been devoted to training staff?  How many days' training has there been?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have details of the number of man hours spent on that.  If the Deputy requires that information I can supply it to him. An extensive amount of training has been provided for those who will be directly involved, mainly decision makers.  That took place late last year and there will be further training this year.</P>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question on agencies that would have information that would be covered by the guidelines from my Department is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I do not know the position regarding other Departments, but I assume the central policy unit under the Department of Finance has also done that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy was referring to.  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in respect of private businesses in respect of business they have been doing with my Department.  I assume the same has been done by the central policy unit.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate what information in general will be available from his Department under the Freedom of Information Act, when it will be available and how it can be accessed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the information is covered by sections 15 and 16 which are the central sections of the Act.  Section 15 obliges each Department, including the Department of the Taoiseach, to publish a booklet of the functions of the Department, each division of the Department, <Col N="1431" /> their roles and structures, public notices and information on the application of the Freedom of Information Act.  The Departments must also give information about procedures and access to information.  In the case of the Department of the Taoiseach the booklet is at an advanced stage and will be ready well before the due date of 21 April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the information be accessed?  Will people have to write in for it or will there be a public office to make it available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The central policy unit will have a general Government booklet but each Department's booklet will be widely available through the Government Publications Office and possibly through library services.</P>
      <P>Section 16 obliges the publication of any departmental schemes in operation.  This may not affect the Department of the Taoiseach but it would include any scheme of which the public should be aware.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to sign a certificate in respect of his Department to exclude from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act information within his Department which he considers sensitive from the point of view of the security of the State, the enforcement of law or international relations?  Will the Taoiseach make a statement to the House indicating the grounds for any such certificates he may intend to issue to ensure that such information is not available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I have no such statement to make and no such areas I wish to exclude.  If it arises I will make a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost to my Department of my visit to the United States from 14 to 16 December 1997 is £11,000.  This is based on standard costs of previous visits to the US. Invoices identifying precise total costs have not yet been received in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach been able to find out how much was netted by the fund-raising event he attended for Fianna Fáil during the trip?  Will he confirm it was in the region of $40,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  On the last occasion this matter was raised the Taoiseach said he would check if his party had received any receipts from such a fund-raising event and that he would <Col N="1432" /> consider whether a <i>pro rata</i> contribution might be made to the costs of the trip, given that part of it was for party purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did say that.  Unfortunately, it is not $40,000 although my party would be happy if it were as much.  The net amount has not yet been established but it will not be near that amount.  I spent less than an hour at the function in question.  I am not sure if I should factor the hour <i>pro rata</i> against the total number of hours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  As the Deputy is aware, I held a meeting with party leaders or their representatives on Monday, 19 January.  I subsequently held further bilateral meetings with party leaders during the course of last week.  At these meetings a range of questions relating to the referendum was explored, including the timing of the referendum.  The Government is continuing discussions with party leaders on the wording of the amendment.  No final decision has been made on a revision of the published wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect to be in a position to give the Government's mature view on the wording?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the weekend the Attorney General and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have, we hope, finalised their work.  I have also received counsel's opinion which the Government discussed this morning.  We are in a position to discuss it again with the party leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the difficulties of precedent this creates but will the Taoiseach consider making available the legal advice or extracts therefrom when it is ready?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed that issue last night and the suggestion is acceptable.  There are precedents and strict rules on this but I am prepared <Col N="1433" /> to give the principles from the legal advice.  That would be useful for everyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take from what the Taoiseach has said that, having regard to various informal communications over the weekend, there is an operational rather than an internal difficulty within the Government in coming to terms with the final wording, so that we should not expect to be communicated with by either the Taoiseach's office or the Office of the Attorney General on a proposed set of wordings for Article 6?  There is no dispute as regards Article 5, the question relates to whether additional cover would be provided in any proposed referendum.  If that is the case, perhaps he would confirm it.  The Labour Party endorses and will support the Amsterdam Treaty but has serious reservations about the draft wording offered by the Government.  Will the Taoiseach confirm it is not the Government's intention to have the referendum required to make the constitutional change to adopt the treaty &mdash;should that be the wish of the people &mdash; until after the first weekend in May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No time has been fixed but I have listened to Deputy Quinn and others regarding the timing.  There is no strict time limit on the Government or the country to ratify the treaty. Deputy Quinn may have misinterpreted my reply to Deputy Bruton.  I did not say there was a difficulty, I said that following the weekend's discussions and the Attorney General's receipt of counsel's opinion, we have a wording which I would like to communicate with the party leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether there are strong views among those involved in negotiating this treaty that to proceed with the second part of the proposed question to the people would cause unnecessary confusion and debate about matters not contained in the treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are strong views on these matters.  The wording of the referendum Bill will provide the Government with the discretion to exercise the options in the Amsterdam Treaty. The difficulty we are trying to overcome is that without a wording which deals with the various issues one could end up having frequent referenda.  We sought advice on that matter and I do not want a final position which deals conveniently with this matter but requires many referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has put his finger on the nub of the issue &mdash;it is likely that further referenda will be required as the Amsterdam Treaty evolves and develops, therefore the wording as proposed tends to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the Government of the day to implement the treaty without reference to the people on critical constitutional issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the issues were critical that would be a different matter.  The critical issue <Col N="1434" /> which has been highlighted, on which both this Administration and its predecessor have given undertakings, is that no commitments will be entered into as regards the common defence area. However, it is a very different matter if there are several very minor issues.  The formulation of the Amsterdam Treaty could mean that we would be dealing with these matters on a frequent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot regard a change in the Constitution as a minor issue.  I agree with the Taoiseach that there are guarantees in relation to common defence.  However, part of the problem is that retaining the current wording gives legs to an argument which has no basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered this; it is the same issue and it is a matter of substance. The Amsterdam Treaty contains an enormous number of general provisions relating to closer co-operation, flexibility, police and judicial co-operation and free movement.  Member states can decide when they sign up to these obligations.  We are talking here about quite minor matters.  That is how the Amsterdam Treaty was put together. Other member states will take up the provisions at various times.  If the Deputy is suggesting that every minor issue in every treaty which Ireland wishes to implement should be put to the people, then I do not think that is what the people want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Only where it involves a constitutional change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>But who interprets that?  I do not think the people would ask us for a constitutional referendum on every minor change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for youth affairs, Deputy O'Dea, spoke in favour for weekend voting and that there was only a 29 per cent turnout for the referendum on bail, will the Taoiseach give a commitment that the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, the training and employment aspects of which are very important to young people, will be held on a weekend to allow young people to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The date will be decided by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  However, the Deputy is correct there are many areas on training and movement in the treaty which are very important for young people. I will pass on the Deputy's remarks to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, in his reply to Deputy De Rossa, seemed to spurn the question which is at the core of the concerns on this side of the House.  There is nothing wrong with a referendum taking place every time a further transfer of sovereignty is proposed between this Republic and the European Union where such a constitutional amendment is required.  Will the <Col N="1435" /> Taoiseach agree the core of the dispute in various Departments is between those European bureaucrats who feel that reference back to the people is some kind of weakness, if not defect, and those who feel that confirmation of the people's will to an agreed Europe is necessary in order for us to make this progress?</P>
      <P>Will he not agree that certainty is needed in regard to the Amsterdam Treaty, which most people would recognise is not a great step forward in itself?  Will he agree there must be a clear and unambiguous assertion by the Government and this House that any further step which involves any transfer of sovereignty, challenged or otherwise &mdash;and I use that phrase advisedly &mdash; will, if necessary, be ultimately subject to the judgment of the people?  That would deal effectively with the concerns of Deputy De Rossa, the Labour Party and many pro treaty people that an enabling provision is being written into the Constitution, which will be exercised without reference to the people at some stage in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is arguing that there should be a general omnibus clause where everything could be taken in.  That is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the suspicion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is a suspicion but it is not the intention.  The intention is to ensure the Amsterdam Treaty can be brought into being and dealt with in a proper legal way and not that any aspect of it which must be dealt with will require a constitutional referendum.  The Deputy may be sure we are not engaged in an argument and nobody is trying to hide anything.  It is a question of how it is monitored and operates in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is a matter of concern to our 14 partners in the EU?  If one member state does not ratify the Amsterdam Treaty in accordance with its constitutional requirements, the treaty cannot go ahead.  Does the Taoiseach agree, therefore, that the uncertainty which has been created concerning the wording of the referendum is causing concern in Europe?  Will he indicate if it is his intention to hold the referendum sooner rather than later?  Does he intend to hold the referendum before the April recess?</P>
      <P>The EMU option, the single biggest option that has ever been exercised under any treaty concerning the European Union and which we will exercise this year, has been exercised under the Maastricht Treaty without any &ldquo;section 6&rdquo; type commission.  This puts in serious doubt the need for a section 6 type section in the referendum Bill. Will the Taoiseach confirm that it has been possible to exercise options, including the option of joining EMU, under the Maastricht Treaty, without an all embracing section such as that proposed in the Amsterdam Treaty Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1436" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's point on the date but no decision has been made on it.  The option of EMU was specifically provided for in the Maastricht Treaty.  We have sought much legal opinion in this regard.  If it is unnecessary to include a provision to deal with the options, I will be quite happy because it will be more simple.  If the situation is not so simple, as at this stage, we will look closely at it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very careful of false advice.  The public would not appreciate our going back to them every time options had to be taken on clear-cut issues.  Issues of fundamental importance are an entirely different matter and the position on at least one of those issues has been stated categorically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the principal option to be exercised by Ireland under the Amsterdam Treaty is the decision to opt into the Schengen agreement which provides for close co-operation in the battle against crime?  We cannot opt into it because Britain has opted out and we do not want checks on the Border.  Is it the Taoiseach's view that if we were in a position to opt into Schengen, because Britain changed its policy, we would have to hold another referendum to allow us to do so unless special provision for options was made in this referendum?</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach refers to &ldquo;any change&rdquo; is he referring to a change in policy under the existing treaties or a change in the treaties?  There cannot be a change in the treaties without another intergovernmental conference and the only change which can occur in policy under the treaties is either a development of policy or the exercise of options on matters not currently obligatory on everybody. If the Taoiseach is referring to a change in policy, then the advice he has received suggests that all changes in policy under the Treaty of Rome and all subsequent treaties will be open to legal challenge because the options provision has not existed in previous referenda.  Is there not a risk that the line of advice he is receiving will be retro-spectively subversive?</P>

      <P>I am talking about changes in policy and options.  We must find a way of dealing with this matter.  In reply to Deputy Mitchell, there is no concern in Europe at this stage.  No other country has held a referendum and we will still be early in this regard.  We need to tie down this matter.  I believe there would be more concern if we finalised a position which required us to return to the people every time there was a change in policy or we wanted to take up an option.  It is necessary to finalise the wording as soon as possible but we cannot ignore the substantial advice we have received.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the referendum and support a number of provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty, concerns about employment, the lack of rights for asylum seekers and refugees and neutrality must be addressed.  In this context, does the Taoiseach intend discussing some of the issues raised today only with parties calling for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote or is he prepared to meet parties such as the Green Party which is calling for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote and, if so, when does he propose to do this?  The Green Party believes that even if the date of the referendum is not agreed weekend voting should be agreed to as this would give an assurance that it is intended to give as many people as possible the right to exercise their franchise.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree there is countervailing legal opinion that in ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty the public must do so in the full knowledge that the options available in the treaty may be taken on board at some time by future Governments, that they are, therefore, agreeing to those options and that it is not necessary on this basis to include in the Constitution a provision which will inevitably give the State broad permission at any time to take on board these options and others.  As we are aware from other attempts at restricting the definition of sections of the Constitution such as that dealing with abortion, it is not humanly possible to say precisely how something will be defined in the future by the Supreme Court in terms of writing in these options.  There is a countervailing legal view that in ratifying the treaty, matters arising under the treaty can be opted into by the Government of the day.</P>

Following on that it was considered best to put the Maastricht Treaty to the people so that questions could not arise and, likewise, it is considered best to put the Amsterdam Treaty to the people. It does not follow, however, that a section 5 must be inserted to approve what was done in Amsterdam and a section 6 which refers to options that are already catered for in the Amsterdam Treaty. Will the Taoiseach agree all we have to do is ratify the Treaty to ensure we meet the concerns arising from the court ruling on the Single European Act?</P>

      <P>As I have indicated already today, it is proposed to hold a referendum on the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution to enable Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam before the summer.  As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 3 from the Deputy on 12 November 1997, the Government will also consider proposals on constitutional issues which arise from commitments in party manifestos and recommendations from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.  I had previously indicated a willingness to consider the Cabinet confidentiality issue further in the light of the work of the all-party committee and the operation of the Moriarty and Flood tribunals.</P>
      <P>The Irish and British Governments have given a commitment that in the context of an overall settlement, arising from the multi-party negotiations, they will propose and support balanced constitutional change, including changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and to section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act.  As I also indicated in reply to the parliamentary question on 12 November 1997, when decisions for constitutional change are taken, the Government's position will be announced and necessary legislation brought forward.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's reply, but it appears to cover a number of years whereas the question relates specifically to 1998.  Does the Taoiseach expect a referendum will be held this year as an outcome of the Northern Ireland negotiations?  Does he see the need for special legislation to provide for a referendum to ratify such an agreement as distinct from changing the Constitution in line with whatever may be agreed on the Constitution?  Is there need for special legislation to provide for a plebiscite to simply approve the agreement and, if so, what preparations are being made in that regard?</P>

      <P>Inevitably, elements of the agreement will require constitutional change and in such instances specific questions will be put to the people.  With regard to the commitment to a referendum to take place in the North and the South simultaneously to approve the agreement, what legislation, if any, is required to provide for that kind of plebiscite, which will seek the approval of the people for what is essentially an international agreement?  It is not a referendum in respect of constitutional change <i>per se,</i> because the Constitution cannot be changed simply by putting the agreement to the people.</P>

Would he agree that what would be required is, first and foremost, a plebiscite for the citizens in this State to establish whether or not they accept and endorse the out-turn of those talks and the basis on which an agreement has been proposed?  Would he also agree that subject to those talks and their finality being acceptable to the people in Northern Ireland, the people would be invited to amend the Constitution to change Articles 2 and 3 in a form that would be agreeable in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland, and that a referendum to amend Articles 2 and 3 without any guarantee that the overall agreement would be accepted and implemented in Northern Ireland would be politically fraught?</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach considered the possible difficulties which could arise if there were contradictory results on the one day?  For example, people might vote in favour of an agreement, but against a change to Articles 2 and 3 which is part of the agreement.  Has the Taoiseach considered how that eventuality could be avoided?  The issue of two separate questions has been inherent in the process from the beginning in that Mr. John Hume's proposal at all times has been that there should be a joint referendum North and South on the agreement.  However, there is a separate proposal for changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  There was always going to be two separate referenda, but the inherent problem is that there could be contradictory results whether the ballots are held on the same or different days.</P>

      <P>I was asked by Marguerite and Georges Bouniol, the parents of Madam Sophie Toscan du Plantier, during their visit to West Cork in December last to meet them and I was happy to do so.  The meeting took place in Bantry on 22 December.</P>
      <P>As the meeting was a private one it would not be proper for me to go into the details of the discussions, as the Deputy has asked, without consulting M. and Mme.  Bouniol in the first instance. However, I expect that they would not have any objection to me relating in general terms what transpired.</P>
      <P>While the meeting was cordial, it was, of course, a sombre occasion.  I was glad to have the opportunity to convey directly to the family my own deepest sympathies and those of the Government on the death of Madam Toscan du Plantier and express my abhorrence at the circumstances of her death.  I informed the family of the very great efforts which the Garda was making to solve the crime; that a substantial file had been forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions; and that while the file was being actively considered by the Director, Garda inquiries were continuing.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that the Director had issued in early January 1997, and subsequently, a number of Letters of Request to the French authorities on behalf of the Garda seeking a number of inquiries to be made in France and that it would appear that one had been responded to.  I explained why there was a problem in executing the Letter of Request which had been received from the French authorities; that what was being sought was essentially the Garda investigation file and that in any criminal case it was important not to prejudice the Garda investigation or any subsequent prosecution by premature disclosure of information to third parties.  I also stated that legal advice had been sought by my Department on the Letter of Request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I assured the family that the Garda investigation was being pursued vigorously with a <Col N="1444" /> view to bringing the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice.</P>
    <P>A formal response to the letter of request was conveyed through diplomatic channels to the French authorities on 23 December.  This was to the effect that my Department had been informed by the Office of the Attorney General that consideration of the request had to take account of the existence of the Irish investigation and possible charges arising therefrom, that the Director of Public Prosecutions had indicated to that Office that it would not be proper to agree to assist the French authorities in the manner requested while a decision was pending on a prosecution in this jurisdiction and that the Attorney General's Office agreed with that view.  Regret was expressed accordingly that it was not possible to accede to the request.</P>
    <P>As regards the present state of the Garda investigation, Deputies will be aware that it is not the practice of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make statements to the House about the progress of individual Garda investigations except in singular instances where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed appropriate.  All I propose to say in this case is that I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the investigation is ongoing and that no effort is being spared in bringing the matter to a conclusion.</P>

Did he apologise for the failure to co-operate fully with the French authorities, allowing for the difference in prosecution procedures?  All they wanted was to be kept up to date.  Is he aware that tremendous damage is being done to our international reputation?  Details of this have been splashed across the international press, particularly in <i>Le Figaro.</i>  M. du Plantier told that newspaper:</P>
      <P>The Irish told us nothing.  Not a word . We still don't know exactly what time Sophie died. Her body lay on the path for 36 hours.  Finally the French Foreign Minister, M. Hervé de Charette, told me officially that Sophie had been murdered.  The first sign of humanity came from France.</P>

      <P>First, I did not apologise to the family regarding the investigation.  As I explained, the Garda is doing everything it can to bring this matter to a conclusion.  I expressed regret to the family regarding the situation with relation to notification and the fact that the pathologist did not arrive for some 24 hours. <Col N="1445" /> Regarding notification, I understand that the Garda authorities stated that the usual procedures concerning notification of the death of a visitor to Ireland which relate to the appropriate authorities representing that person were followed in the case.  Unfortunately, the French media broadcast reports of the matter very soon after it occurred and before the victim's husband could be notified by the authorities.</P>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that there is a difference between French and Irish law on this matter. There is no possibility whereby the Irish authorities could hand over the file or sensitive information in it in accordance with the French authorities'  request without prejudicing the investigation.  The Garda has done everything it could in this case.  Statements have been made by various people on the case, and I cannot be responsible for those comments.  I am accountable to the House for the Garda, and it has informed me that it is doing everything it possibly can to bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
      <P>The family members I met in Bantry on 22 December understood that the Garda was doing everything possible to resolve the matter.  Since this Government came to office, an Assistant State Pathologist has been appointed with a view to ensuring that expeditious examinations will be carried out in tragic cases such as this.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> I will ask the Minister a blunt question.  Will somebody be charged for the murder?  A recent article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> stated that the National Bureau for Criminal Investigation was recently brought in and the Garda are quoted as stating &ldquo;they won't get anybody.&rdquo; Has the file been sent to the French authorities?  Does the Minister acknowledge there has been tardiness in dealing with this case, particularly from the point of view of arrests?  Is there a tendency in certain criminal investigations to build up the case rather than move for an early arrest, with the result that vital forensic evidence is destroyed or tampered with by the time an arrest is made?  Is that what happened in this case?</P>

      <P>A file has not been sent to the French authorities.  As I already explained, that cannot be done without prejudicing the investigation and the possibility of a subsequent successful conviction.  I cannot comment on whether somebody will be charged, other than to say the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of his functions and no doubt will make that decision in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investigation into this brutal murder must proceed under Irish law.  A basic element of Irish criminal law is that sufficient evidence must be available before a person can be charged with an offence and nothing must be allowed interfere with that process.  What we are talking about is an investigation being carried out by the Garda Síochána and every effort being made to bring to justice the perpetrator or perpetrators of this <Col N="1446" /> horrific murder.  I do not have control over comments in the media or elsewhere.  All I can do to assist the Deputy is reply to his questions and put the matter into context.  It is often discussed out of context, with disregard for our criminal law which has served society extremely well over generations and continues to do so.</P>
    <P>Every effort that can be made is being made to bring the perpetrator or perpetrators of this horrific crime to justice and that will continue.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>the measures, if any, he has taken to implement the concept of zero tolerance as contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3323/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In answers to previous questions I discussed what is involved in the concept of zero tolerance.  There should be no need, therefore, to reiterate that it means enforcement of the law of the land.</P>
      <P>There are three essential components to the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime. There is a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in crime, a determination to ensure the law enforcement agencies are properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime and a commitment to address, and where possible ameliorate, the causes of crime.  Action is proceeding on all three.</P>
      <P>As regards targeting particular criminal activity, the Deputy will be aware of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997 which is before the House.  I am satisfied this major criminal law reform measure is clear practical evidence of the Government's policy of zero tolerance towards crime, particularly, but not exclusively, towards drug trafficking.  The Bill contains a series of very strong measures which are, regrettably, all too necessary as a response to those who inflict such harm on our community.  I will briefly list those measures.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the Bill deal with mandatory minimum sentences for persons trafficking in drugs to the value of £10,000 or more, speedier trials arising from the abolition of preliminary examinations and automatic court inquiries into the assets of people convicted of drug trafficking offences with a view to confiscating them.  In relation to mandatory minimum sentences, the Bill amends the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 to provide for a new offence of possession of drugs with a value of £10,000 or more with intent to supply.  It provides for the imposition of a minimum penalty of ten years where a person is convicted of the offence.  This will apply automatically, subject to certain limited exceptions relating to the interests of justice.  For example, a court will be able to take into account the fact that a person pleaded guilty or materially assisted the Garda in the investigation of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the normal statutory remission will apply to persons sentenced for the new offence, the Bill <Col N="1447" /> prohibits the granting of temporary release except for grave humanitarian reasons and any such release can be for only the limited duration necessitated by those reasons.  Where the court is satisfied a person convicted of the offence was addicted to drugs and that addiction was a substantial factor in the commission of the offence, it may list the sentence for review after not less than one half of the sentence has been served.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that on conviction for a drug trafficking offence the court will automatically determine whether the offender has benefited from drug trafficking, unless the court is satisfied the amount which might be recovered would not be sufficient to justify the making of a determination, with a view to making a confiscation order.  At present under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 such an inquiry takes place only upon application by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I have also introduced other pieces of criminal law reform which clearly signal a zero tolerance policy to various forms of offending.  As I have said previously in the House, the lasting effects of any Government's crime policies have to be assessed over the long-term rather than the short-term.  In the short-term the signs are promising, as evidenced by the provisional crime statistics for 1997 which show that indictable offences are down by approximately 10 per cent over 1996, the largest annual decrease in recent times.</P>
    <P>Any long-term anti-crime policy must engage local communities in co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  To encourage greater co-operation I have established a Crime Forum which commences on 26 February.  This will give a unique opportunity to the general public to contribute openly to the debate on the wide range of issues which impact on crime.  Following the forum I intend to establish a permanent crime council, to continue this open approach to crime policy development.</P>
    <P>It is essential also that our criminal justice institutions are structured and managed to optimise their contribution to tackling crime.  The Deputy will be aware that to achieve this I have embarked on a process of establishing our courts and prisons services on an agency basis and a fundamental review of the probation and welfare service is also under way.  Furthermore, the process of implementing the recommendations of an SMI review of the Garda Síochána is in train.  A steering committee, with a full time implementation team, has started work in the last month.</P>
    <P>Following on from the Government's anti-crime strategy and the commitment in the Government programme, I have introduced a witness security programme in the area of serious organised crime, most notably in the drugs and money laundering areas.  This programme ensures the criminal justice system can take prosecutions in cases, which by their very nature attract the most serious and hardened criminals.  This new programme provides for a formal structure to <Col N="1448" /> process applications by persons who wish to be considered as protected witnesses and are prepared to give evidence against former accomplices.</P>
    <P>The programme may be applied to an individual, whatever his or her legal status, who possesses intelligence or information regarded by the competent law enforcement authority as being material to criminal proceedings and who is considered to be at risk because of evidence given in court.  The type of programme provided is an operational matter, decided on a case by case basis, by the Garda Síochána following evaluation of available intelligence and includes short-term police protection at the time of trial, new identity, relocation, as well as possible financial compensation.</P>
    <P>The programme is under the control and administration of the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers and has a budget of £250,000 for 1998.  This money is allocated to a separate sub-head of the Garda Vote to ensure accountability in the expenditure of these moneys.</P>
    <P>Other measures introduced include the most extensive prisons building programme undertaken in the history of the State and a commitment to raise the strength of the Garda to 12,000 within the lifetime of this Government.  I am in the process of considering further measures that would strengthen existing legal provisions and thus enhance the operation of the programme. These measures are complimentary to the current programme which is already in operation.</P>
    <P>My approach, therefore, is wide ranging and comprehensive and seeks not only to put various categories of criminals out of business, but to address the underlying causes and ensure the relevant institutions are properly structured and resourced for the very difficult task on hands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the concept of zero tolerance still mean pursuing every offence, including the most minor, and that no crime is insignificant?  Will the Minister agree that the term &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo;, when used prior to 6 June 1997, gave the clear impression that the practice of policing would change consequent on his moving into Government?  Has there been a change in the practice of law enforcement since he became Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Zero tolerance means precisely what it meant prior to the election.  Deputy Upton has correctly identified certain aspects of it.  Prior to, during and since the election I have done my level best to explain what the Fianna Fáil Party meant by zero tolerance.  If Deputy Upton wishes me to repeat it now, I will.  It never envisaged, nor did I ever say it would mean, that buskers, beggars, pavement street artists&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;and double yellow lined errant motorists would end up in prison.  I said it <Col N="1449" /> meant the enforcement of the law of the land.  I said also that where additional penalties or additional laws were required they would be introduced.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1997, introduced before Christmas significantly strengthens the hands of the courts.</P>
      <P>To enforce the concept adequately there is a need to increase the number of prison spaces. That is why we are increasing the number of prison spaces by 1,000 in the first two years of the life of the Government.  The reason is &mdash;and this is a criticism I made from the Opposition benches on numerous occasions &mdash;that people are being released into the community, sometimes on the sole criterion of an insufficiency of space to keep them.  It those circumstances it behoves any Minister in a civilised society to ensure society is protected.  This is what I have tried to do.  I am confident we are on target to provide a sufficiency of prison spaces and to increase the number of gardaí in the force to 12,000.  I am confident the measures implemented to date and those to be implemented during the lifetime of the Government will tackle this serious problem in a real and meaningful way.</P>
      <P>If people want to put a misconstruction on the concept of zero tolerance and pretend it always meant that beggars or pavement street artists would end up in prison there is nothing I can do about it.  At no stage was it envisaged that zero tolerance would mean additional sanctions.  So far as minor crimes were concerned it always meant the enforcement of the law of the land.  The Garda Síochána and I are trying to enforce the law on behalf of society.</P>
      <P>The concept of zero tolerance comprises three essential components.  First, there is a clear and determined focus on tackling those engaged in crime.  We will do whatever is necessary, within the law, to effectively tackle those who deal in drugs but the concept does not apply exclusively to drugs.  Second, there is a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime.  The Government will continue to provide the necessary resources in terms of personnel and equipment to the Garda to achieve this.  The overtime bill for the Garda Síochána last year was unprecedented but it had the results I predicted.  Third, there is a commitment to address and, where possible, to ameliorate the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>I have expanded the network of youth diversion projects which target young people at risk of falling into criminal lifestyles.  Inasmuch as we must be tough on crime we must be tough also on the causes of crime.  That is the reason I have initiated a crime forum which will commence work on 26 February. That will lead to a crime council and in turn will lead to the first White Paper on crime in the history of the State.  That is as comprehensive a reply as I can give to Deputy Upton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">

      <P>Has there been a change in the manner in which the law has been enforced since the Minister took office and zero tolerance <Col N="1450" /> became the order of the day?  For example, have traffic laws been enforced more vigorously?  Has there been a higher level of prosecutions?  Has the petition system changed and, if so, can it be reconciled with the concept of zero tolerance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be clear to Deputy Upton that the law of the land is being enforced. Questions have been tabled today in relation to various motoring offences, statistics for which are outlined.  It is clear the Garda Síochána is enforcing the law.  There has been a change since this Administration came into office.  There has been a change in terms of the resources being made available to the Garda to effectively conduct its work.  There has been a change in terms of the legislation which is crucial to provide it with the armoury to do its work better.  There has been tremendous success in regard to the whole question of drug dealing.  Many people have been charged and a considerable number of seizures has been made.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána has always said that, given the resources, it can do the job better than anybody else.  I am satisfied that statement is true.  If the Garda Síochána is provided with a sufficiency of resources, it will carry out the desired work. Since this Administration came to office, the Garda Síochána has been given considerable resources.  Obviously, as their numbers and prison spaces are increased, the criminal justice system will gain further respect from the community.  It would be invidious of Deputy Upton to suggest nothing has changed.  Considerable changes have taken place and there is a conscious effort by the Government to fight the scourge of crime on the streets.  This is being illustrated daily in terms of resources, legislation and commitment.</P>

      <P>A court accompaniment scheme for victims, whether of crimes of domestic violence or otherwise, is operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support with funding from my Department.  The association has a full-time staff to assist in its administration while trained volunteers accompany victims to court, if they so desire.</P>
      <P>The service is available in the Central Criminal Court, the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court and District Courts as well as family law courts in the Dublin area.  With the help of significantly increased funding from my Department, plans are being drawn up to expand the service countrywide.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the needs and requirements of all victims, including victims of domestic violence, are deserving of the most effective supporting mechanisms possible.  It is for this reason that I intend to introduce a new charter for victims of crime, the drafting of which will be assisted by the deliberations of the conference on victims of crime organised by my Department last December.</P>
      <P>As regards assistance to witnesses, my Department published booklets some time ago explaining what happens in court.  The objective was to allay the fears and apprehensions young people may have at the prospect of going to court.  While it is intended to publish similar booklets for adults, much of the information available is relevant to them.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of booklets is of no help or assistance to those involved at the coalface of the criminal justice system.  I refer the Minister specifically to the position of victims <Col N="1452" /> before conviction.  In almost all cases involving domestic violence the victim is also the chief witness for the State.  The machinery employed by the State is grossly inadequate and lacks compassion and sensitivity.  There is a need to ensure the introduction of a familiarisation course, as part of which the victim will be brought through the evidence.  The State refuses to do this.  Until this happens victims will have little or no confidence in the criminal justice system.</P>

I am committed to the welfare of all victims particularly those mentioned by the Deputy, the victims of domestic violence.  I have increased the allocation to the Irish Association for Victim Support from £280,000 last year to £645,000 this year.  Having examined the plans of the association for the next three years, I am satisfied this funding will be used well and effectively to promote the welfare of victims.  The national steering committee on violence against women has recently been established under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace.  It will address a wide range of victim related issues.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need to improve the lot of victims and I have taken a number of steps in this regard.  The explanatory booklets are not sufficient in themselves but they are of some assistance.  It would be unfair to suggest otherwise.  A charter for victims of crime will be introduced.  I anticipate this matter will be discussed during the deliberations of the crime forum when it commences its work at Dun Laoghaire Town Hall on 26 February.</P>

The national steering committee on violence against women has recently been established under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace.  Like my colleagues in Government, I am concerned about the increase in the number of women who have to avail of the services of refuges or crisis helplines.  The statistics show that there were 20,000 distress calls and that 2,000 women and over 4,000 children were accommodated in refuges in the two year period 1996-7.  I sincerely hope all women are becoming fully aware that they do not have to suffer in silence.</P>
      <P>In general, there is a clear recognition by the Government of the need to address this extremely serious problem.  That is why the measures I outlined are being taken.  I am confident that through those and other initiatives the problem can be successfully addressed.</P>

A useful conference on victims of crime was hosted by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Dublin Castle last September and its deliberations will be of considerable benefit in framing the charter.  I envisage the crime forum discussing this matter further.  I would like to have its report on this matter before deciding to proceed with the publication of the charter.  I am committed to it and I told Victim Support in Ireland that I will fulfil the commitment I gave in Opposition to publish the charter in due course.  It can be taken as practically certain that the charter will be published this year but I cannot give the Deputy a precise date at this point.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 31, 40, 90, 97, 107, 119, 125 and 129 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda already have an extensive range of equipment to help them monitor and detect breaches of road traffic regulations including dedicated marked cars and motorcycles, unmarked cars with detection video equipment, hand held and mounted lasers and a GATSO unit.</P>
      <P>GATSO is a system built into an unmarked vehicle which can monitor large numbers of vehicles at any one time and provide rapid computerised readouts of those exceeding the speed limit.  They cost £50,000 each.  I authorised the purchase of a second unit late last year and I understand it will be in operation shortly.</P>
      <P>I am considering proposals from the Garda Síochána for the purchase of more GATSO units as well as a supply of cameras which would operate on fixed sites.  I have asked that the proposals be considered first by the High Level Steering Group on Road Safety, representative of all the agencies involved in road safety, that is to say, my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council and the Irish Insurance Federation, which is urgently developing a national strategy on road safety at the direction of the Government.</P>
      <P>It is clear to the Garda authorities that excessive speed, seat belt offences, drink driving and careless pedestrian behaviour are the major causes of accidents.  Specific action was taken in 1997 to target them.  In July 1997 the Garda National Traffic Policy Bureau was established. That involved the restructuring of the traffic section at Garda Headquarters.  The bureau's mission is to focus on strict enforcement of the traffic laws and on the education of the public on road safety.  The bureau is headed by a chief superintendent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 July 1997 the Garda launched Operation Lifesaver in the Louth-Meath Division, an area with one of the highest incidences of fatal accidents.  That campaign was extended nationwide in the autumn.  Operation Lifesaver involves high levels of patrolling, checkpoints and speed checks.  There was an unprecedented number of offence detections as a result.  In the period 14 July to 12 October 1997 there were about 37,000 speeding offences, 21,000 of which were dealt with by fines on the spot, 21,000 seat belt offences, 1,400 dangerous driving offences and <Col N="1456" /> 1,066 drink driving offences.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Lifesaver will continue nationwide right throughout 1998.  Its effectiveness will be constantly reviewed and improvements to enhance enforcement will be made as necessary.</P>
    <P>Road accident statistics including deaths for 1997 are rightly a cause of public concern and it is regrettable that despite enforcement activity statistics for this year so far suggest there has been no improvement.  I know the situation is being taken very seriously by the Garda Síochána who are determined to do all they can to deal with it.  It will also be of particular concern to the High Level Steering Group on Road Safety which may be expected to review it urgently.</P>
    <P>For my part I intend to ensure that the Garda Síochána have the resources necessary to play their part fully.  At the same time I must point out that enforcement alone cannot succeed unless the motoring public make a serious effort to obey the traffic laws.  The fact that 37,000 speeding offences were detected in the three month period 14 July to 12 October 1997 sends its own clear message about our observance of these laws.  The law is there to be obeyed and it is in everyone's safety interest to play his or her part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Minister acknowledge that the measures in place are not working and that something will have to be done?  A total of 453 people died in 1996 as a result of road traffic accidents, 470 died in 1997 and 47, well more than one per day, have died this year, which means we are heading for an unfortunate tragic record again in 1998.  I put it to the Minister that speed is the real problem and it is necessary to change our attitude to it.  These were not accidents but criminal events caused by flagrant breach of the law.  Unless we change our mindset and view speed in the same context as, we now view drunk driving, matters will not change.  To underline the seriousness of the position, should we not introduce a charge of manslaughter where there is a flagrant breach of the road traffic Acts leading to death?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Use of a motor vehicle causing death can give rise to a number of different charges and, in certain circumstances, can give rise to a charge of manslaughter, if used quite deliberately to kill somebody.  A motorist can be charged with murder, dangerous driving causing death, dangerous driving, careless driving and driving without due care and attention.  There is not an insufficiency of offences, but there is a need for a far greater observance of the traffic laws, in particular, observance of the speed limits. I assure Deputies that the enforcement of the speeding regulations is given a very high priority because it has been identified, as Deputy Higgins correctly points out, and I agree with him, as a major factor in road accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction recently of new equipment to the gardaí to help them fight speeding on our <Col N="1457" /> roads has been welcome in general terms.  The equipment currently in use by the gardaí in enforcing the speed limit includes hand held radar guns, tripod mounted lasers, radar and video cameras as well as the GATSO unit.  The statistics for prosecutions and convictions for speeding are impressive.  For example, the number of convictions in 1993 was 29,590 and in 1996, 33,387.  These statistics demonstrate the success of the Garda Síochána in prosecuting these offences using the very latest technology.</P>
    <P>I have been assured by the Garda Síochána that its enforcement of road traffic law is rigorous and ongoing and that it is given the high priority it deserves in day to day operations.  If one examines the statistics across a range of motoring offences over the past number of years, it is clear that the gardaí have been doing their work effectively.</P>
    <P>The argument could be made, as Deputy Higgins seems to suggest, that more could be done to prevent deaths on our roads.  In this context I am informed by the Garda authorities that there were 453 fatalities in 1996 and that the figure for 1997 was 474.  In the first half of 1997 there were 26 more fatalities than in the same period in 1996. In the second half of 1997 there were five fewer deaths than the comparative period in 1996, that is, the second half of 1996.  Although the overall number of fatalities increased in 1997 over 1996, the rate of increase slowed down and there is little doubt that this was due to the Garda Operation Lifesaver action plan.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Higgins points out, however, the number of deaths on our roads is unacceptably high and, accordingly, the gardaí are strengthening their enforcement tactics.  In addition, they avail of every opportunity to use local and national media to reinforce their road safety message.  In this context they co-operate with the National Safety Council's special campaigns against speeding and so on.  The inter-agency high level steering group on road safety, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda, is now preparing a road strategy document as a matter of urgency.  This will be presented to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government and will provide the basis for the Government's future action plan on road safety.</P>
    <P>In regard to road deaths in 1998 and whether the trend is continuing, tragically the statistics for 1998 show &mdash;and it is important that everybody knows this &mdash;that if the current trend in fatal accidents continues, the total number of fatalities for this year could reach between 500 and 600. The Garda Commissioner has appealed to motorists to slow down, wear a seat belt and not drink and drive.  I reiterate that now and I am sure I will be joined in that call by Deputy Higgins and every Deputy in the House.  The Commissioner has promised an increase in Garda activity to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads.  The Garda Síochána is confident that the measures it is taking, including Operation <Col N="1458" /> Lifesaver, will lead to improved results in the longer term.  As I said earlier, Operation Lifesaver will continue throughout 1998.  I am satisfied&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the results from the introduction of cameras in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have been impressive and that, at £20,000 per camera, they are value for money?  I put it to him that the use of this equipment should be introduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously these cameras are quite useful and the Deputy will be aware this has been recognised.  He will be aware also of the high number of on the spot fines imposed by the Garda Síochána for speeding offences.  In so far as it is possible, modern technology will continue to be introduced and utilised in the fight against road traffic offences, including speeding.  I have outlined already that the equipment available to the traffic corps includes GATSO, a sophisticated mobile radar video computer system capable of multiple detections, tripod mounted lasers, laser guns, in-car videos and other specialist vehicles. As technology becomes more sophisticated, the Garda Síochána will be only too pleased to acquire such equipment in order to tackle this extremely serious and urgent problem.</P>

      <P>The Government discussed the matter today.  We are not putting a resolution to the House but the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation will make a statement later today. The Government seeks the best interests of the children and parents concerned in this matter. Following representations we have received from several for the parents involved we consider that what is required initially is an independent private inquiry.  We will announce that such an inquiry will be set up forthwith.  Dr. Roderick Murphy, a senior counsel and chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, will carry out the investigation and will contact the interested parties.  This is in line with what has been requested by the swimming interests and the representatives of the children.  It will be set up as a matter of urgency and will report within four weeks.</P>

      <P>With regard to the same issue, the Taoiseach wrote to me on 3 February about the bringing into effect of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges <Col N="1462" /> and Immunities of Witnesses) Act.  I understand that the Whips agreed yesterday that the sub-committee on Dáil reform of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be the designated sub-committee to deal with the introduction of the Act's provisions.  If such an Act were in operation this House could set up an inquiry such as that to which he has referred, with the powers to compel witnesses to attend and without the difficulties associated with judicial inquiries. In the light of the decisions made yesterday by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, will the Taoiseach consider charging the Oireachtas with the establishment of such an inquiry?  The Oireachtas is answerable to the public, unlike lawyers, although they are at least answerable to the tax authorities.  The Oireachtas should have the power to hold such an inquiry and it would be able to compel witnesses to attend, having due regard to the rights and privileges afforded by the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They need to be addressed. Following the Deputy's raising the matter in the House I moved to pursue a number of those issue and to clarify the position with the Department of Finance.  The Minister will make a statement on this matter shortly and, hopefully, Dr. Roderick Murphy will be able to report within four weeks.  I am conscious that there is a large number of cases involving many areas of Irish life and we must reflect carefully on that.  I am also aware that the Eastern Health Board alone has over 1,000 pending cases concerning child sexual abuse.  It seems that a large number of community, voluntary and sporting organisations are affected by cases pending.  These matters merit reflection.  I was answering with regard to the case concerning the swimming club into which the Minister will announce an independent private inquiry under Dr. Roderick Murphy.</P>
      <P>In view of the changes with regard to compellability of witnesses and the committee system there is merit in considering that approach.  In terms of confidentiality and what parents have said to the Government, we must be conscious that many parents, children and their various representatives are conscious of the laws of privacy. I do not believe that is insurmountable.</P>

Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the proposed course of action involving a private inquiry by Dr. Murphy has the agreement of the parents' representatives?  Has the Government decided whether it is ruling in or out the possibility <Col N="1463" /> of a sworn public inquiry after the conclusion of the private inquiry?</P>

      <P>The Minister will make a statement to the public later today.  He is taking questions on this matter in the House tomorrow and I am sure any queries can be raised at that time. The Government's assessment is based on our best view of the interests of the children and the parents.  The decision is made on the basis of contact by a number of parents.  I do not know whether it would be accepted by all the representatives &mdash;it seems some parents will be legally represented but others will not, so I cannot categorically state the position.  I know Dr. Roderick Murphy will be talking to them and on my behalf the Attorney General will talk later this evening to the solicitor who has been to the forefront on this issue &mdash;he sent me a letter and I want to respond.</P>
      <P>As I stated last week, we rule nothing out but it is our assessment at this stage that an independent private inquiry by Dr. Murphy is the best option.  I am conscious that a number of these cases have been dealt with by the courts.</P>

      <P>My party has put down a motion to bring into effect the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act.  The Taoiseach wrote to me on 3 February &mdash;the meeting to which I referred took place last week, not yesterday &mdash;and the requirement set out in his letter has been addressed, that is, the sub-committee has been identified.  All that is now formally needed is for the motion to be taken.  Since it is a motion to give effect to an Act which has been passed by both Houses, I presume there is no dispute or division about it.  Once the motion is taken, this House or these Houses can, if it or they so choose, establish the kind of inquiry with full compellability of witnesses which we sought as far back as the inquiry into the funding of the arms crisis over 20 years ago.  Does the Taoiseach not agree it is imperative that this legislation be brought fully into commission as a matter of urgency?  Could he give an undertaking that he will specify now or communicate with me later when the Houses could take the motion, so that the Act is brought into commission and we can proceed, if we so choose, with doing the business for which we have been elected?</P>

      <P>I can check this later for Deputy Bruton but I understand that in view of the urgency of establishing a social service inspectorate, it has been decided to proceed with this on an administrative basis.  It is envisaged that the social service inspectorate will be located in the Department of Health and Children.  The existing general powers of the Minister for Health and Children and the specific powers provided in section 69 of the Child Care Act will underpin its administrative arrangement.  In the longer term, it is accepted that the inspectorate will need to be established on a statutory basis.  I think the Deputy will agree this is a way of speedily moving the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I gave a broad welcome to the proposal to increase the number of board members of An Bord Pleanála.  As other speakers have said, it is also important to increase the number of staff working in the board.  It could be assumed that one of the reasons for this Bill is that An Bord Pleanála is facing an increased workload.  An increased workload leads to strain, mistakes and decisions which can be questioned. An Bord Pleanála is under intense pressure.  The same could be said about many local authorities.</P>
      <P>It should be possible for an applicant to apply for planning permission and get a response within two months, if it is a straightforward matter. However, there have been instances where local authorities have kicked to touch and have told the applicant on the day the decision was to be made or close to it, to supply more information. There is a delay of a further two months which can be frustrating for the applicant.  I suggest the Minister direct the local authorities to take account of this issue.  It is frustrating not only for business people and industry but also for the householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reservations I have about the Bill is that it should have taken into account a review of An Bord Pleanála.  There is a lack of openness in some of the board's decisions.  I note it has absolute discretion to hold oral hearings and will generally hold one where it aids its understanding of a particularly complex case or where it considers that significant national or local issues are involved.  An Bord Pleanála should be more open.  In days of yore, people were allowed to petition <Col N="1471" /> the King in person if they wanted to make a case.</P>
    <P>In east Cork the ESB plans to erect 81 pylons around Cork harbour and people are incensed that An Bord Pleanála has refused to grant them an oral hearing.  The Taoiseach has been drawn into the matter.  The ESB is being asked by one of the Minister's colleagues to appear before Dáil committees on the issue.  An Bord Pleanála should be more open about how it decides whether to hold oral hearings.  This is an emotive issue in east Cork.  We have had conflict between ESB workers and local landowners and the Garda have been involved.  The situation is getting out of control.  The Minister will appreciate that the Taoiseach should not be brought into such a matter.  An Bord Pleanála has a case to answer.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister might consider including a provision in the Bill whereby An Bord Pleanála would have to be more open.  The buzz words today are &ldquo;openness&rdquo;, accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;.  This is an example of where a State institution is not open, accountable and transparent.  I hope the Taoiseach he will be able to use his legendary powers of negotiation to stop this conflict in east Cork because it is getting serious.  What does it take for An Bord Pleanála to hold an oral hearing?</P>
    <P>Those objecting to the ESB plan include Cork and Harbour Environmental Lines, 35 landowners, East Cork Tourism, the Vintners' Association, Cork IFA, Cork Tourism, Cork Harbour Anti-Pylon Group, Aghada and District Community Council, Cobh and Midleton UDCs, Passage West Town Commissioners and two local chambers of commerce, representing business and industry in the area.  In addition, 5,000 signatures have been collected, including that of the Bishop of Cloyne, and yet An Bord Pleanála has decided it is not a significant national or local issue.  If this is not a significant national and local issue, what is?</P>
    <P>When An Bord Pleanála decides not to grant an oral hearing, as in the circumstances I outlined, and especially when another semi-State company such as the ESB is involved, people tend to come to the conclusion that the two State agencies are in cahoots.  I know that is not true, but people are coming to that conclusion about Big Brother &mdash;An Bord Pleanála and the ESB.  I call on the Minister to speak to An Bord Pleanála and ask it to review its procedures as regards oral hearings because this is an important issue.  I know of other cases where this has happened. This is an important matter about which people are concerned.  Tourism interests are at stake. Cobh is one of the most important towns in terms of tourism.  Liners, etc., dock at Cobh.</P>
    <P>There is a question mark over the ESB's costings.  An Bord Pleanála included them in its final report, although it said it would not do so in the High Court.  The High Court judge involved in the case recommended that An Bord Pleanála hold an oral hearing but it ignored him.  There <Col N="1472" /> are large question marks over this matter.  The Minister should use his authority to discuss its procedures with An Bord Pleanála before we increase its membership.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála.  Members of the public are annoyed and upset when they must wait many months for a decision from An Bord Pleanála.  Taxpayers expect the public service to do a job within a reasonable period when it is being paid to do so, but that is not happening with An Bord Pleanála. It has taken board a long time to make decisions which have affected many people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Stanton spoke about the ESB.  The Minister is undertaking two reviews at present one concerning new legislation on planning laws and the other on housing.  The ESB is helping to increase property prices.  We often talk about rural Ireland and I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, a rural Deputy, is here because he will understand this problem.  As an Opposition Deputy, I am sure he got many representations from young couples trying to live in rural Ireland.  When they decide to install electricity in their homes, they get a bill for £8,000, £9,000, £10,000 or whatever the ESB decides to charge. That has not helped those wanting to live in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will deal with the ESB in his review of housing.  If this monopoly did not exist, we would have competition and would know what people should pay.  I know the Minister will look at that issue because he is a practical rural man.  Two people came to my clinic last week with bills for £9,000 and £8,000.  The ESB tell them to take it or leave it.  They have no choice but to take it.  The sooner we end the ESB's monopoly, the better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind the policy of the party. The Minister of State made many statements when in Opposition which I hope he will follow through in Government.  He had all the answers when sitting on the other side of the House.  I, as a rural Deputy, depend on him and know he will not let me down.  When he was on this side of the House he, like me, had all the answers but he is now in a position to ask the ESB and other State agencies to give young couples with low salaries a chance and not charge them £8,000, £9,000 or £10,000 or whatever amount the engineer decides depending on his form to install electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I have been in public life for many years and we receive numerous representations on planning applications.  I sent a letter to An Bord Pleanála some months ago and received a reply which told me that while the letter was received in time I did not enclose the required £30.  It is not fair to expect public representatives <Col N="1473" /> to pay £30 every time they make representations on behalf of the public to An Bord Pleanála.  The Minister should examine this matter.</P>
    <P>There is no democracy in the planning laws as it is the county manager, together with the planner, who make the decision.  I am concerned about the close relationship between local authorities and An Bord Pleanála.  In a recent case a Bord Pleanála inspector gave 15 reasons a planning application should be refused, yet he granted the application because it had been made by a local authority.  Ballina Urban District Council proposes to build houses in an area which has been zoned for amenity purposes.  Arguments have arisen over a map and the county manager has said he does not think the area where the housing development will take place is zoned for amenity purposes but the rest of the area is.  The residents had to pay an engineer to make their case, but the county manager is using taxpayers' money and does not really care.  If an area is zoned for amenity purposes the local authority should not be able to use the heavy hand of the law to grant planning permission.</P>
    <P>Like me, the general public is concerned about the close relationships between local authorities and An Bord Pleanála, and I hope in reviewing planning laws consideration will be given to setting up a planning board in every county.  These boards could be made up of members of the council and the general public appointed for a two or three year period.  While they may not be professional people it is important to remember that sometimes professional people have influenced decisions which turned out to be wrong. When a professional person makes a wrong decision for example, in relation to a planning decision he will not admit it but ordinary people working often look at matters in a different light. I hope the Minister takes this point on board.</P>
    <P>Local authority members no longer have powers in planning matters now that the little power they had under section 4 of the planning laws has been taken from them.  The decision made by Mr. Justice Blayney was not appealed to the Supreme Court.  No member of An Bord Pleanála, county manager or planning official has to stand for election.  However, we have to go before an interview board in the form of the electorate, every few years and I know from experience that they can be very difficult to please.  It annoys me that we have to answer for decisions made by An Bord Pleanála and county managers.  I hope this situation will be changed in the review of the planning laws.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Some people may oppose a planning application because of a falling out with a neighbour but most people have genuine grievances.  I welcome any measure which will ensure that decisions are made more speedily.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition he tabled many questions on the reintroduction of grants for renovating old houses.  In fairness, the previous Government should have reintroduced these grants.  I am not saying grants should be <Col N="1474" /> given to millionaires who have benefited from the tax relief schemes.  Rather I am referring to people who earn £15,000 or £16,000 and those who live in housing estates.  Many of these people bought their houses ten or 12 years ago and cannot afford to reroof them or put in new windows or doors.  I hope the Minister will do something for them.  There are various tax relief schemes available for the rich but there is nothing available for middle income earners and it is time something was done to help them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieHealyRae" hpid="Mr. Healy-Rae Mr. Healy-Rae">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning appeal system is weighted against the developer.  It should be placed on a level playing pitch.  The third party appeal system is different from the systems in other European countries.  If a developer is refused planning permission the decision can only be challenged through the High Court by way of a judicial review, which costs approximately £100,000.  If a developer is successful it is likely the court will send the matter back to the board which will again refuse the development for different reasons.</P>
      <P>Why should one developer be allowed build 17 houses on 11 acres when another developer is allowed build eight houses on 11.5 acres?  The statistics published in An Bord Pleanála reports make very interesting reading.  In 1994 41 per cent of planning decisions were confirmed by the board, 36 per cent of decisions were amended by the board and 23 per cent of decisions were reversed by the board.  It is extraordinary that the figures for 1995 were exactly the same, 41 per cent confirmed, 36 per cent amended and 23 per cent reversed.  The same statistics were given in a report in the 17 December 1997 edition of <i>The Examiner.</i>  It is a mystery how the figures are the same.  I do not accept them and would like to know if the Minister or anyone else accepts them.</P>
      <P>I know a person in a remote rural area of County Kerry who employs five people and who applied for planning permission to extend a shed so that he could employ four more people.  He was granted permission by Kerry County Council but was refused it by An Bord Pleanála.  It is extraordinary that while an official from An Bord Pleanála examined the site and gave written confirmation that he proposed to grant planning permission, for some unknown reason when the decision was conveyed by An Bord Pleanála some months later planning permission was refused.  A developer who sought planning permission from Mayo County Council to extend a holiday complex and caravan park in Cong had to wait five or six months for a decision.  When permission was refused an appealed was lodged, but that was turned down, at great cost to the developer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept many of the decisions by An Bord Pleanála.  While Members of this House must declare their interests and must not step out of line, a team of faceless people in An Bord Pleanála is requesting extra staff.  I do not know who those people are, but will the Minister make <Col N="1475" /> them answerable, if not to me and my colleagues, at least to himself?  People who are refused planning permission should have the right of appeal to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  They cannot afford to spend thousands of pounds on a judicial review.  If I had my way, I would sack all officials of An Bord Pleanála and provide that the Minister would have the final word on planning permissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for sharing his time with me.  I support many of the Deputy's sentiments.  The Minister, in his speech, outlined the need for extra staff and extra members on the board of An Bord Pleanála. There has been a significant increase in the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála in recent years.  There should be an overall review of the operations of An Bord Pleanála and of the planning systems within local authorities.  In my constituency the number of queries received about planning has escalated &mdash;other Deputies will confirm the same in their constituencies &mdash;from one or two per month to nine or ten per week because of refusals by planning officers.</P>
      <P>There is no consistency, even within the same planning office of a local authority.  For example, different interpretations are put on the county development plan and on ribbon development. New jargon has been introduced by modern day planning officers.  Problems relating to regional roads, red brick, bay windows and so on are used as reasons for refusing planning permission.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should seriously consider planning operations and the need for consistency.</P>
      <P>Problems arise with ecowarriors, An Taisce and cranks who put forward objections for the flimsiest of reasons, and those objections end up on the desk of An Bord Pleanála.  Many people believe, as I do, that the board operates under a cloak of secrecy, with little or no explanations of how it arrives at decisions.  There is need for greater openness in regard to decisions on planning refusals and whether a person should be allowed an oral hearing.  In many cases An Bord Pleanála is simply a rubber-stamping organisation in that it upholds the majority of decisions of local authorities.  I agree the statistics given by Deputy Healy-Rae are not factual because very few decisions are reversed by An Bord Pleanála. The Minister should consider the matter of rubber-stamping by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter that should be seriously considered is the decentralisation of An Bord Pleanála.  That body is hidden away in Dublin like a faceless person.  If a questionnaire was circulated among the public asking who are the members and the chairman of An Bord Pleanála, nobody <Col N="1476" /> would know apart from the Minister and his officials.  I have never seen an inspector from An Bord Pleanála carrying out an inspection in my constituency.  When planning permission is refused by a local authority, does an inspector from An Bord Pleanála go to the area and consider the reasons for the refusal?  Does he refuse the appeal on site or does he make the decision from his office in Dublin?  Perhaps the Minister will outline the operations of inspectors.</P>
    <P>A person who is refused planning permission by a local authority has little chance of winning with An Bord Pleanála because he does not have the resources to employ an architect, engineer or environmental health officer to get the advice needed to overturn the decision.  An Bord Pleanála, on the other hand, has the expertise of county council engineers, health inspectors, planners and architects who give their reasons for refusing planning permission.  The punter must depend on somebody who draws up plans to put together a case because he cannot afford professional expertise.  That system is unfair and should be considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that few people challenge in the courts decisions by An Bord Pleanála.  Apart from major building contractors and developers, most people cannot afford to take a case to court, to pay solicitors and barristers, the legal eagles who are ripping off the system.  That is the only reason decisions are not challenged.  I am not saying that this matter should be considered under this Bill, but consideration must be given to the fact that ordinary people are unable to challenge the expertise of local authorities and legal officials.</P>
    <P>The local authorities must consider the matter of consistency when addressing planning operations within councils.  For example, ribbon development is a major issue.  Some planning officers will interpret the county development plans and decide that two or three houses side by side constitute ribbon development while others will decide that it is six houses.  Yet we are told that the plan is the preserve of the members, who have their own views on how it should be interpreted.  However, as soon it takes effect planning officers will interpret it differently and not in the spirit in which it was developed through the county council.</P>
    <P>Planning officers are to blame for the movement to urban areas for the purposes of house building and purchasing.  It is practically impossible to get planning permission in some areas of my constituency of Wexford.  Reasons for refusing permission include the presence of regional roads, the use of byroads to access regional roads, ribbon development, prohibition on the use of red brick in certain areas, because it would not blend with the sea, the sky or the surrounding trees, and on the use of Tudor style housing because it would not blend in with the surrounding area.  People have become so disillusioned with these restrictions that they are moving out of rural areas and buying houses and sites in the <Col N="1477" /> towns.  It is shameful that local authorities do not operate in the best interests of rural Ireland as they should.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minster of State, who has a deep interest in housing and planning, is to review the planning laws and regulations.  In the interest of rural Ireland, the sooner this happens the better.  Given the high prices of houses in urban areas, I hope he will ensure that people are allowed to build more houses in rural areas. While there is a saturation of houses in urban areas, the seaside resorts and along the coastline, the countryside is being left without housing.  In constituencies like mine, houses are not being built, people are moving away and villages are being denuded.  These developments will have major consequences for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It provides an opportunity to discuss planning generally.  An Bord Pleanála is the bugbear of most Deputies and public representatives.  The board does not want to deal with us. When we try to question the Minister regarding its decisions or about individuals who may have appealed to it we are told that such activities are outside his remit.  There is a need for more transparency.  Will the Minister consider the establishment of regional offices where people can consult the board in the same way that they can consult health boards and other regional bodies?</P>
    <P>I support the increase in staffing for An Bord Pleanála if it means that it will make speedier decisions, but I am not sure this will happen.  I also have reservations about the appointment of such extra staff from within the board.  Many people who know the difficulties involved in planning and in trying to get major developments off the ground would be suitable.  The Minister should look outside the board and bring in people who have common sense and a wide knowledge of planning and the difficulties which are being encountered.  I hope that we will have quicker decisions and an end to the delays which are leading to job losses and are preventing many builders and developers from putting their money to work.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its purpose is to increase the membership of An Bord Pleanála, which is also to be welcomed.  The current membership of the board, the chairman and five ordinary members, is inadequate to meet the level of business referred to it.  The recognition that the expansion of the board needs to take immediate effect is welcome, while the proposal to limit the extension for a maximum period of five years is prudent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has listened to the call for the interim appointments, for a maximum period of nine months, to be made from within the board's existing staff members.  To be effective <Col N="1478" /> in removing the backlog of appeals which are blocking the system the action being taken in this legislation must be capable of immediate effect. Those charged with the task should be in a position to get on with the work immediately.  Upon their appointment, employees of the board should be suitably qualified in this regard.</P>
    <P>The workload of the board increased by 14 per cent in 1995 and the Bill proposes to increase its membership to deal with this.  From 1995 staffing levels have also been increased.  The growth in planning applications over the same period in Fingal County Council, of which I am a member, is approximately 36 per cent, more than twice that of the board.  This growth must be recognised and funding must be provided to local authorities to enable them deal with the increases in applications.  Among applicants, local authority officials and council members there is a realisation that growth is putting pressure on the planning system, which is now overloaded.</P>
    <P>The public are entitled to a quality service. Equally, those who provide it must be adequately resourced and equipped.  Some of the additional workload which has given rise to the need for this Bill could be avoided if enhanced customer care and attention were possible at the local authority planning counter.  The frustration which all sides experience can only be bad for the planning process and for local government.</P>
    <P>Many local authorities are in the process of reviewing their development plans.  Fortunately, it has been possible to recruit additional personnel to support this important work.  I call on the Government to expedite the review of planning legislation and to steer the necessary reforms through the House as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We in the developing authorities know of the urgent need for the creation of enterprise zones which can be pre-designated for industrial development to expedite the formalities of granting planning permission without the customary six or 12 month delays.  For a fast track approach to be adopted, the planning authority should be able to stake out an area deemed suitable for industry, zone it and classify in general terms what category of industry would be permitted, the type and style of construction and the other fundamentals in advance of an application and without the involvement of the applicant or promoter. Experience shows that when an industry opts for Ireland it will wish to develop its involvement. The saying in business that time is money was never more true than today and in some instances it is true to say that time costs jobs.  We must respond and change to meet this position and put in place a fast tracking application system which takes account of this industrial need.  When these enterprise zones are confirmed in principle, only the details remain to be decided.  Such applications should not be subject to third party appeals as the core issues will have been already adequately dealt with in the process of the establishment of the enterprise zones.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> Speed for all development is of the essence and this is why I support the Bill, but also why I call for more resources at local authority level and for the fast track approach.  People want to get on and they must not be frustrated when driving the economic motor of the nation.  All An Bord Pleanála decisions should and must be delivered within four months.  The planning process must be seen to work.  Equally, all local authorities should be resourced to allow them determine all applications within two months.  The current perception is that officials only get round to looking at applications days before the decision date and, as a result, hide behind requests for additional information.  This must stop.  The opportunity to submit additional information should, on the part of the applicant, be confined to once only, forcing the applicant and his agents to get the initial application details correct.  The planning process must be seen to be transparent with due care taken and all reports open to the public.  The Minister must ensure the infrastructure is in place for the next millennium, allowing for economic advancement while providing structures which protect the environment.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for legislation to effectively deal with the issue of unfinished estates and developments.  There are many in my constituency and throughout the city and county of Dublin.  It is a scandal which must be stopped.  It is totally unfair that purchasers of new houses, bought on borrowed money over 25 or 35 years at prices which are too high for ordinary working people, find themselves living, in some instances for years, in the middle of building sites.  Something must be done in this regard.  There is much more the Minister needs to do.  However, I support the Bill as it attempts to address the problem.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  If the additional membership of the board will help speed up the decision-making process, it must be welcomed.  At present there is a major difficulty with many planning matters regarding decisions on appeals.  This is holding back development under seaside resort schemes, in designated areas and in urban and rural areas.  More individuals are inclined to object to developments now because people are more sensitive to the environmental impact of developments and how they might affect their quality of life.  We can expect more appeals in the future as the land available for building runs out and people are forced to build in environmentally sensitive areas.  Due to the increased level of development, there is more pressure for land and, as a result, planning matters will become more sensitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional members of the board should speed up the decision-making process.  However, <Col N="1480" /> more staff are required on the ground.  There should be more communication between An Bord Pleanála's field officers, applicants and objectors.  That has not always been the case in the past due to time constraints.  In circumstances where applications were refused outright or permission was granted, people were dissatisfied because the thinking behind the decisions was not communicated properly to them.  They did not learn anything from the experience.  However, all parties benefited in cases where there was more communication between An Bord Pleanála officials and the applicant or objector.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of staffing at council level.  Some county planning offices are busier than others, but the planning staff in County Kerry are under considerable pressure because of the large number of applications.  The county is mainly rural and I do not want to imagine the position in urban areas where there may be even more pressure.  Staffing levels in areas with high numbers of applications should be adequate to meet the demand.  I am sure the Minister agrees more thought is now put into planning applications because various aspects must be considered by planners.  I will refer to this aspect later.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to deliver decisions speedily and efficiently.  This is most important irrespective of whether the decision is negative or positive.  Developers are entitled to know as soon as possible if they can proceed.  Objectors to developments should also be taken out of suspense.  The important point is that decisions are made swiftly and there are no unnecessary delays.</P>
    <P>We may query the thinking behind some An Bord Pleanála decisions in the past.  However, in general, the board's decisions have been well reasoned.  In my experience there are few cases where decisions could be disputed.  However, as Deputy Browne said, it is also important that the reasons for decisions are communicated to the applicant and the objector, who may be community driven or acting in an individual capacity, if only from the point of view of public education. This will help people to make the right type of applications in the future.  People can learn much from previous positive or negative An Bord Pleanála decisions.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry I pushed for the creation of a national landscape policy.  As a nation, we should grasp this nettle and draw up a policy which would address many of the issues which are so controversial at present.  When I was Minister of State I brought together an interdepartmental committee under the auspices of the Department, although it should probably work under the auspices of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I felt I was taking the right approach to the matter.  There was a lot of enthusiasm among the members of that committee although we met on only a few occasions.  They understood the benefit of a national landscape policy which would involve clear guidelines emanating from Government to <Col N="1481" /> local authorities, groups and the planning profession.  It would inform what we want from planning and how the landscape could be protected.</P>
    <P>I made a proposal for a national landscape policy then which is still relevant and which I hope to encourage Fine Gael to adopt for the future. Maybe the Minister intends adopting such a national landscape policy.  I asked him about this last November but he was not very forthcoming on the issue, suggesting that what I proposed was covered adequately by existing guidelines and legislation.  I disagree.  A national landscape policy would give formal recognition to landscape quality and to its contribution to the overall quality of life, which is very important.  Reference has been made to industrialists coming to this country for the quality of life and landscape.  Most tourists come here for the environment.  We have gone against proper practice in much that we have done to our environment recently, and that will not do our tourism industry any good in the future.</P>
    <P>The promotion of good principles of landscape management in the local, regional, national and European contexts is very important.  This is a European issue, not just a local matter.  I attended the Special European Conference on Rural Development at which there was a major emphasis on national landscape policy.  There is a great champion of such a policy in the Department of Environment and Local Government, Mr. Terry O'Regan in Cork, with whom the Minister of State's officials will be familiar.  He has championed the demand for a national landscape policy over the last five years, and at this point he must be frustrated and feel he is a voice in the wilderness.  However, this matter is gathering momentum.  It is not just a green issue or associated with a small group of people.  It is becoming a major issue, and it is time we woke up to it.</P>
    <P>A national landscape policy would provide support for the preparation and ongoing review of guidelines for better landscape management.  It would lead to the co-ordinated dissemination of information and skills relating to landscape to all those whose activities impact on landscape quality and who would benefit from same.  When advising people on making planning applications, the impact on the landscape is never discussed. There are no guidelines apart from some vague aspirations.  There are examples all over Ireland where one asks of recent developments, &ldquo;How did the person get planning permission for that development?&rdquo;  The reason is that we have no clear guidelines, consistency or standardisation.  A national landscape policy with guidelines would help enormously in the standardisation and preservation of our environment.</P>
    <P>In adopting such a policy, the Government would have to recognise the fundamental importance of national landscape quality in all its diversity and in all settings, taking all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity of the landscape.  Bills dealing with the environment, planning and the landscape would be heavily influenced by such a <Col N="1482" /> policy.  A national landscape policy would also co-ordinate the collation of information on all aspects of landscape and would commission additional research, where required, to facilitate the establishment of a comprehensive reference resource for the preparation and subsequent ongoing review of guidelines.</P>
    <P>Afforestation, ribbon development and the respect being shown for rural and urban architecture are among the issues that relate to a national landscape policy.  I will return to this topic.  The Minister of State, as a pragmatist, should examine it closely.  He comes from Galway, which has one of the finest environments and landscapes in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983 and to provide for an increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála, which is restricted by the 1983 Act to a chairman and five ordinary members.  This Bill will allow the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to increase the size of the board where the Minister considers the workload of the board warrants such an increase.  The Bill does not specify the number of additional members that may be appointed, but allows the Minister to do so by order.  Any order will be for a period not exceeding five years and will be subject to a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The Bill responds to a need of which public representatives at all levels will be aware.  The Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on responding quickly to a situation many believed was getting out of control.  Any applicant for planning permission, or in the case of an appeal when there is a third party, has the right to due process under the law.</P>
      <P>Given the four months time constraint, new developments and the huge workload of the board, applicants and others believed it was impossible for their applications to be given the consideration they deserved.  The Minister gave figures relating to An Bord Pleanála's workload: it dealt with 2,800 cases in 1995, 3,500 in 1996 and 4,500 are expected in 1998.  This is a major increase.  On one hand it reflects the positive developments in the economy.  On the other, it shows up various shortcomings in county councils, Departments and elsewhere.  With this kind of increase it is natural that the response period has slowed.  Interestingly, it was as high as 98 per cent at one point, but it has since slipped to the low 80s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past two years planning staff have experienced an enormous increase in their workload.  A planner gets a feel for an area by getting to know it, and in conjunction with technical training he or she develops the capacity to deal speedily with applications.  I support Deputy Deenihan's points about Kerry County Council's planning department, which is under considerable pressure.  The efficient staff in the planning <Col N="1483" /> section, however, have managed to keep on top of matters and have made excellent decisions over the years in the best interests of the county. The rate of applications has increased in most councils, but staffing levels have not.  There have been calls for a new county development plan.  A substantial number of councils who would normally have reviewed their plans every five years are running two or three, and in some cases up to five, years late.  That is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>There have been enormous changes in the manner in which the planning process operates. This is the first stage at which the crisis in the local government system arises and the next is when the number of planners is not sufficient to deal with the number of applications.  Given the two month time constraint, it is inevitable that planning staff will seek more information at a late stage.  This angers applicants and increases the workload for councillors and Deputies trying to resolve the matter.  They must talk to planners which involves a further waste of time.  It is now accepted that the most effective way to deal with planning is at local level.  However, trained permanent staff are needed to ensure the process moves smoothly, that county development plans are back on their planning agenda and that background technical work is undertaken.</P>
    <P>Developments which would not have excited any interest five or ten years ago are now the focus of attention for groups of concerned citizens.  There has been a change in how third party citizens view their relationship to particular planning applications.  I have no difficulty with this when those raising objections live in the immediate area of the proposal, but I have a difficulty with people who live miles away having an input.</P>
    <P>Planning legislation covers a period of more than 30 years and it is accepted that it is appropriate to consolidate all existing legislation into a new parent Act, as was successfully achieved in the area of roads.  One Act would simplify the operation and interpretation of the planning code within the local authorities and the private sector.</P>
    <P>The current public consultation procedures should be continued for significant development proposals.  The areas where such consultation is not required should be clearly defined and expanded where necessary to take account of the limited impact on the public of certain works, and works that must be carried out to protect public health in the area.  A clear distinction should be made between Parts IX and X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 so that it is clear which section should be used for particular developments.</P>
    <P>The format of the county development plan is significantly influenced by the parent Act which is more than 30 years old and does not truly reflect the needs of the current era.  Issues that need to be addressed include the importance of local area plans, the use of the terms &ldquo;policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;objectives&rdquo;, the scope of the development plan and other policy areas.  The inclusion of more <Col N="1484" /> local area plans within the county plan would increase public interest in the adoption of the plan.  People are generally more interested in their immediate areas than in policies for an entire county.  There are financial and staffing implications in the preparation of more detailed area plans which would require consideration.</P>
    <P>The fees for applications should be increased to a more appropriate level.  Given the capital cost of building a house at a modest £50,000, a fee of £100 would not be excessive.  It would provide local authorities with funds to employ more staff to deal with increasing demands and might also have the effect of reducing frivolous repetitive applications.</P>
    <P>The 1994 regulations expanded mandatory referrals to statutory bodies which has created a dilemma for local authorities when requesting additional information.  By law the planning authority is allowed request additional information only once and is reluctant, therefore, to do so until all reports have been received from internal and external resources.  This has resulted in additional information being sought later than necessary in the two month period.  If necessary, planning authorities should be empowered to seek additional information as soon as possible without the limitation of being unable to seek further information at a later date within the two month period of the lodgment of the application. This would ensure applicants are made aware of the need for further information at an early date.</P>
    <P>The requirements for a valid application should be expanded to include other essential information without which a planning application cannot be processed.  This would reduce the need for requesting further information at a later time.  Such information should include details on the source of water supply, the public mains and the group water scheme, the letter from the group secretary, the location of a well on the site map, where the septic tank is required and percolation and water table test results.  The council recommends the preparation of regional planning guidelines to reflect the diversity of circumstances in different areas.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Principal Act should be addressed to take account of decisions which have taken a very broad view of categories of development that may be exempt.  Exempted development criteria for agricultural buildings should be tightened.  The written consent clause regarding neighbours within 100 metres of a proposed development tends to be inoperable.  Such structures can be constructed in a very short time which makes the planning authority's enforcement procedures more difficult.</P>
    <P>Forestry exemptions are too high, particularly when one considers their impact on other developments.  I recommend a sizeable reduction in the area of forestry that should remain exempt.  The nature of turf cutting has changed dramatically, with machinery now clearing large areas in a very short time.  While I recognise the difficulties involved, planning permission should be required for any new areas not yet worked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1485" /> The current regulations regarding advertising signs are too lenient in respect of signs erected for travelling shows.  Court decisions have viewed events such as &ldquo;Ideal Homes Exhibitions&rdquo; as travelling shows, thus circumventing the need for permission for such signs.  In a county like Kerry such widespread signage has a detrimental impact on tourism.</P>
    <P>Development contributions should be an integral part of sustainable development in a county. Contributions should not be limited to expenditure by the planning authority within any period, but should be payable where services are available.  Services are provided on a country-wide basis and expenditure is confined to individual areas at given times.  This should not, however, remove from the developer the duty to contribute for the services he or she enjoys.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration should be given to the imposition on local authorities of the duty to pay compensation where a decision to grant permission by a local authority has been overturned by An Bord Pleanála.  Such a decision is outside the control of the council and may impose a huge financial burden on it.  It is also necessary to re-examine the workings of a section 13 notice when a decision of An Bord Pleanála refers to &ldquo;pre-maturity&rdquo; as a reason for refusal.  The compensation consequences of refusing permission for a development on the grounds of designation of land as SAC, NHA or SPA need to be addressed in the legislation review.</P>
    <P>Sections 31 to 35 of the Principal Act should be amalgamated so that all enforcement notices are issued under one section, thus avoiding a defence challenge to an incorrect notice being served.  Conviction of an offence of contravention of such a notice should also allow the court to compel the offender to carry out works and not just impose a fine.</P>
    <P>In light of differing court decisions, legislation should clearly define what constitutes intensification of use.  Such clarification would assist the local authority and developer and avoid the necessity of legal proceedings in many cases. Legislation should also clearly outline time limits for discontinuance of use to aid local authorities in their deliberations.  This area requires re-examination to ensure the clearest possible definitions are utilised to ensure a minimum of uncertainty.</P>
    <P>In regard to public notices, if a site notice cannot be made visible from the public road, the need for two notices, one on the site and another on the nearest public road should be considered.  A site notice may not be visible from a public road, but the resulting development may be.  The impact of unsolicited information on the two month time period should also be examined.  Such information may be of interest to third parties, but because of the time restriction this may not be possible.  The onus should be on An Bord Pleanála to clarify to the applicant the conditions imposed on appeals which may be open to more than one interpretation.  In relation to applications <Col N="1486" /> for the subdivision of industrial units, fees should be imposed only on the area of the new development and should not relate to the entire development.</P>
    <P>All new legislation and regulations should be circulated to local authorities on computer disk in addition to hard copy.  This would help to access information quickly, particularly in relation to areas such as exempted development.</P>
    <P>Planning laws treat major and minor developments similarly.  It would be desirable if the planning process could be simplified for categories of development which are of a minor nature. Planning authorities could be given discretion to dispense with some of the regulations and to accept simplified documentation and procedures in respect of minor developments.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest the above observations be considered in the review by the Department. Some of the points raised require amendments to legislation, others amendments to regulations and some may be clarified by circular letter.  All points are put forward with a view to improving the operation of the planning service and to ensuring consistency and clarity for both the local authority and the public.</P>
    <P>The role of An Bord Pleanála has become a great deal more important than was perceived in the past and its composition ought to be examined in the near future.  I am interested in the submission from the staff of An Bord Pleanála to the effect that they wish to be considered for interim positions on the board.  I do not know on what basis they made that proposal.  Clearly they consider they are more <i>au fait</i> with cases.  Planners who have dealt with the case and made a recommendation would undoubtedly feel their judgment was questioned if overturned by the board.</P>
    <P>Given the time constraints placed on the Minister under existing legislation, he is right to make interim appointments.  If not, there will be a greater backlog of cases and it will be difficult to return to a situation of 100 per cent of cases being dealt with in the four month period.  We should aspire to reach that position as quickly as possible.  I do not agree the only beneficiaries would be the developers.  Many genuine applicants who are dissatisfied with the decision of the local authority and who refer their cases to the board are entitled to have their cases heard within a certain timescale.  Third party objectors, some of whom may have a frivolous objection but the vast majority of whom have a genuine interest, are entitled also to have cases decided within the specified time and to due process, with a sufficient level of staff and board time available to deal with their cases.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  There is a need to upgrade An Bord Pleanála and to re-examine the whole area of planning.  There is obviously a need to expedite decisions of An Bord Pleanála and the proposal by the Minister to increase the numbers on the board will facilitate this.  A debate has been taking place with regard to increasing staff numbers, the services provided and the professionals in An Bord Pleanála.  Perhaps the Minister will address the issue of improving the efficiency and speed with which decisions are made on the cases coming before the board.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the confusion which sometimes arises with regard to decisions. However, over 90 per cent of the decisions of Limerick County Council are upheld by the board.  That is an indication of a large measure of agreement on policy.  No doubt there are difficulties in the planning area, especially at local level.</P>
      <P>The planning process has changed considerably in the past 12 years since I became a member of a local authority.  Environmental issues play a major part and rightly so.  The environment is the most important heritage we can pass on to the next generation.  Any organisation that assists its protection should be commended.  However, we must maintain a balance.  On occasion there is a scare regarding the environmental impact of some developments.  Industries which may be regarded as less friendly on the basis of their product are safe when operated properly.  We must ensure that a balance is maintained and that we do not scare off industries which have an environmental problem.  Environmental impact statements cover this issue.  We do not want to become a State which, because of concern for our planning rules and regulations, scares off industries which in the operation of their activity are environmentally friendly.  We must not operate on the basis of doubt but on fact.</P>
      <P>Public relations may be lacking in many areas of An Bord Pleanála.  Its role is not understood by the public.  It is amazing the number of times public representatives have to explain An Bord Pleanála and its independence to constituents who are dissatisfied with a decision of a local authority.  They see in their report from the local authority they have the right to apply to An Bord Pleanála.  At that stage they often ask what An Bord Pleanála is about.  Its role, independence and importance is not as clear as it should be to the public.  Local authorities may have a role to play in this.</P>
      <P>The role of the public representative should be recognised by An Bord Pleanála.  We can make inquiries but we should not seek to influence its decision in any way.  There should be a facility to allow our views to be put on the record after a decision has been made.  We should not be allowed a role other than to put our views on the record of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> With regard to local decisions I detect a growing tension, certainly in the county council of which I am a member, between elected representatives and the planners and the planning section. We fully accept the different roles of the planning section, the county manager and the public representatives.  The public representatives are the oil which assists understanding and communication between the public and any office of State. We are expected to do that when concerned about decisions and should be listened to.  For example, there is much concern about delays at local level.</P>
    <P>Six or seven weeks after a person applies for planning permission he has to answer a list of eight questions.  It is unacceptable that the two months wait for a decision commences after the reply.  That is unfair, it creates much frustration and is bad PR for the planning section.  The Government should look at the staffing of planning sections.  There should be a full examination of the staffing levels in local authorities and the management of the planning section.  Management systems and approaches in most local authority planning sections remain unchanged.  Applicants should be advised within two weeks of the date of receipt of applications of their status and the requirements to be met.</P>
    <P>A strong effort is being made to block ribbon development, a sensitive issue in rural Ireland.  I do not agree with this.  There is a need to encourage people to live in rural areas.  It has been said that people should build in towns and villages but insufficient sites are available.  I appreciate land may be acquired by compulsory purchase order but that is not the way to advance.  If the current trend continues, within 15 years no houses will be built in rural areas and every school on the western side of my constituency will lose a teacher because of depopulation.  This will have a knock on effect on the local community, sports club and churches.  Permission is refused for such reasons as that the road on which a person plans to build is too narrow.  People are leaving rural Ireland as a consequence.</P>
    <P>Every person in Ireland, if one goes back one or two generations, has a rural background.  We are not British, we have a different culture and approach in terms of where we want to live.  Many people want to live in rural areas and commute to their place of work but it will be impossible to do this within ten years.  Every obstacle is put in their way.  I am concerned that we will have a beautiful countryside for tourists but with no people.  A balance has to be struck.  It is only recently that we have become an urban society.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill.  Anything that will improve the planning process should be welcomed.  As a member of a local authority for many years, I am well aware of the problems that can arise at local authority and An Bord Pleanála level.  Planning is a sensitive issue for all concerned &mdash;the person who wishes to build a single <Col N="1489" /> house, the developer and the local authority where it plans to develop a landfill site.  The process can have a major effect on the community. It is vitally important, therefore, that people with an expert knowledge are involved at the highest level, especially in An Bord Pleanála.</P>
      <P>There has been much criticism about the length of time it takes local authorities to process planning applications and An Bord Pleanála to process appeals.  Different time limits should be specified.  An application to build a single house in a rural area, major housing and industrial developments and landfill sites should not be subject to the same criteria.</P>
      <P>In the past local authorities and some State bodies were not subject to the planning process. This led to problems.  The process should be carefully monitored by the Government.  There is a view that forestry development has resulted in flash floods in certain parts of the country and impacted on the state of county roads.  Developers have never been asked to contribute to their upkeep, unlike farmers who increase output. In urban areas applicants are charged on-street parking fees.</P>
      <P>Whenever an inspector from An Bord Pleanála visits a site in connection with an appeal local authority members are not asked for their views. Provision should be made for this, although in certain cases they might prefer not to be asked for their opinions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The time is right for the Minister to conduct a thorough evaluation of the workings of An Bord Pleanála which has made outlandish decisions on numerous occasions.  Let me give one example.  Last year Cork County Council granted planning permission to a person who was born and reared on the Beara Peninsula and forced to seek a living in Great Britain through no fault of her own, like many others in the 1950s and 1960s.  She had planned to retire to her native region.  A third party appealed against her, however, and An Bord Pleanála upheld the appeal and did not allow her build a house in her native region.</P>
      <P>This woman made a second application to reconstruct her late mother's homestead and again obtained permission from Cork County Council.  This was appealed by a combination of third parties, who were members of An Taisce, and an individual from Ballycroy in County Mayo who wrote a seven page letter to An Bord Pleanála appealing against the decision of Cork County Council.  That letter was identical to the one submitted in the first objection.  The result was that An Bord Pleanála upheld the third party appeal and refused permission to this poor woman to reconstruct her mother's homestead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the time is right to nip this practice in the bud.  Members of An Taisce can make outlandish appeals against these misfortunate people wishing to return to the country where they were born and bred.  Having spent 40 years in Great Britain the woman I <Col N="1490" /> mentioned was refused planning permission on two occasions, yet these blow-ins can retire here and take up permanent residence.  They do not want anybody to live in Ireland but themselves. We have a large number of settlers in the country who are competent and realistic people.  They do not object to every permission granted by Cork County Council in my region.</P>
    <P>In his reconstruction of An Bord Pleanála I ask the Minister to ensure that he can have his say in regard to decisions on appeals.  I ask him to act before it is too late because faceless people can write letters of seven, eight and ten pages making frivolous objections to people trying to build houses in their native land.  That is outlandish and should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Certain decisions by An Bord Pleanála have deprived rural Ireland of industrialisation.  Various county councils throughout the west of Ireland, from Mizen Head to Malin Head, have given permission for development only to run up against a barrage of protest by people who are not natives of the country and who would not care if there was no industry in an area.  We cannot live on fresh air and cold water.  The views of the inhabitants must be taken into consideration as well as the people who come here to retire.  We welcome those people with open arms, but I ask the Minister to put some type of curb on their power to object to proposed developments by misfortunate people who want to return here and build a home in the land where they were born and bred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always refreshing to hear Deputy Sheehan; his common-sense contribution is a tremendous addition to this House.  I hope, in a more modest and abstract way, to make some of the points he has made in his contribution.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out when introducing the measure, the third party appeal procedure in Ireland is almost unique in the European Union. It is too well established in our public culture to even consider abolishing this particular facility.  I am glad the Minister has introduced this legislation, having noted the increased incidence of appeals in recent years, because the operation of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála can put a real brake on community and economic development. If we are to sustain our economic and social advancement, it is vital that An Bord Pleanála should dispose of its business with rapidity.</P>
      <P>In a more general sense all sides of the House would welcome this measure because it endeavours to increase the efficiency of the board, but Members like to reflect on the operations of the board generally.  It was decided that politicians could not be trusted with this area in its entirety and that some of the business of making decisions in relation to planning should be committed to what in substance is a judicial body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That decision was made in 1976.  Of course the local representative is still involved in the formulation of the development plan and can continue to make representations at the planning committee <Col N="1491" /> about any particular application &mdash;the file can be requisitioned and representations made about it.  However, we have decided to consign a great number of sensitive, important decisions not to the political process but to a judicial process.  That judicial process is not just applying known law to disputed facts but is making value judgments about what the community does or does not require in terms of desirable development.  Having made that decision to commit this whole branch of public business to a judicial body, it is of enormous importance that this House ensures that body operates with public confidence.</P>
    <P>In relation to the role of the public representative, I would like the Minister to examine the reason public representatives have to pay a fee in the event of wishing to make a submission on an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  Since An Bord Pleanála is dealing essentially with public business involving choices about policy questions which are highly political, it is appropriate that public representatives should make submissions to the board which are clear and reasoned, and that they should not be charged for so doing because it is something they should do in the proper discharge of their function as representatives.</P>
    <P>A further aspect of An Bord Pleanála as a judicial body which will have to be examined is the whole question of the secrecy that attaches to the proceedings of the board.  The reason people have confidence in judicial bodies generally is that, under the Constitution, they are required to perform their operations in open court before the press and be available for full inspection by the public.  It is improper to suggest that a judicial body cannot be made accountable to this House in a reasoned way.</P>
    <P>It could be said that when the board hands down its decisions the reasons for a refusal must be set out in the decision on appeal and equally the various conditions attaching to a development if a development is permitted.  As far as it goes that is desirable, but I would like to see a greater cataloguing of these decisions.  There should be the facility for the board to give reasons for the decisions on particular applications so that scholars can examine them and ensure there is a consistency of interpretation where the board is concerned.</P>
    <P>A point that constantly strikes one as a public representative is the enormous variety of opinion that seems to exist among planning officers about the desirability of particular planning applications.  If An Bord Pleanála laid down the law in a consistent way, that conflict of opinion would not exist.  That is the way it works in the courts. The courts hand down decisions which are reported and commented on publicly, but the reasoning of An Bord Pleanála is terse in many of these decisions and is not open to a great deal of rational scrutiny.  The public can lose confidence in the board when they see what appear to be inconsistent decisions mirroring in An Bord <Col N="1492" /> Pleanála the same problem I already mentioned at local level where planning officers seem to have widely divergent opinions about what is and is not desirable.  It is important An Bord Pleanála operates in a predictable way.  The only way to ensure that is by requiring that not only an inspector's report be made available, but also the final determination of the board giving reasons for a refusal or conditions attaching to a development.  In landmark cases that should be accompanied by a reasoned opinion so that a corpus of opinions can be developed by the board, analysed by commentators and planning experts and evaluated in a critical manner.  That is a hallmark of a free society.  I am not happy at the level of reasoning in the board and the extent to which the public can evaluate how its decisions are arrived at.  That is an important point because if we remove the board from all political scrutiny the reasoning of its decisions must be obvious to the general public if we are to have a predictable planning system.</P>
    <P>I accept that the abuse of the retention application procedure does not arise strictly on this measure, but it is relevant to the general question of public confidence in the planning system.  Far too often we find the sequence of building, retention and permission being followed rather than the sequence of permission and building.  Because of that many citizens lose faith in the planning system.  When the compliant citizen who observes the rules and obtains permission or refusal sees another person not observing the rules a consciousness develops that sinning has its own reward as far as the planning system is concerned. There should be a review of the planning code to ascertain if a greater penalty or perhaps a greater fee should be attached to people who make retention applications and who have opted in the first instance not to comply with the planning code. The public would respect the planning system more were it clear that those who do not comply with the code do not have an easy facility to find a way around it.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Michael Ahern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth of our economy is reflected in the increase in the number of houses and business developments during recent years. Consequently, there has also been an increase in the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála, especially since mid-1995.  There has been an increase of more than 44 per cent in that two year period.  Because of that An Bord Pleanála considers it necessary to increase its number of staff. It has a statutory objective to decide cases within four months, but due to its increased workload it cannot meet that objective.  On those grounds the Bill is acceptable and necessary.  However, most speakers I heard today and on the other occasion this Bill was debated put forward views on An Bord Pleanála's decision-making process, especially the lack of information on the detailed reasoning behind many of its decisions, as outlined by Deputy Lenihan.  It gives a reason for a <Col N="1493" /> decision, but does not outline the reasoning behind it.  That does not apply only to An Bord Pleanála, but to many statutory boards set up to make decisions because of a prevalent view that politicians are not honest or capable of making decisions.  However, those independent bodies do not seem to be accountable to anybody.  Accountability, openness and transparency should apply to them as to other organs of Government.  The operation and decision-making process of An Bord Pleanála should be examined, as should the planning process at local authority level.</P>
      <P>It is strange that an applicant may be refused planning permission because a proposed development may block the skyline, but that may not be important to another planner.  The colour of the brick may be another reason one planner refuses permission, but it may not prevent another planner granting it.  There is a lack of consistency at that level as well at An Bord Pleanála level.  That frustrates our constituents and public representatives.  I did not notice such frustration up to five years ago but in recent years it has crept in because of the lack of consistency in decision-making.</P>
      <P>An Bord Pleanála is supposed to be an independent body, but my constituents in Cobh, Aghada and Midleton would question its objectivity, especially in light of an important matter which has arisen in recent months.  It relates to an ESB plant which would require 80 massive pylons across the island of Cobh and east Cork.  A court case was taken by some farmers in the area and their counsel requested An Bord Pleanála to hold an oral hearing.  Counsel for An Bord Pleanála was amenable to that, but I understand the ESB used its influence to block an oral hearing and it was not heard.  My constituents and I consider the objectivity of An Bord Pleanála has been called into question.  In light of its refusal to grant an oral hearing, it is not surprising that it was supportive of the county council's decision to grant permission.  Its decision may have been correct from the point of view of planning, but to allay the public's fears and suspicions openness and transparency should have prevailed and the oral hearing should have proceeded at which the reasons behind that decision should have been made public.  An Bord Pleanála is falling into disrepute because, like other statutory bodies, it is treating the public with disdain.  Those bodies are not listening to the public or meeting to discuss matters in detail with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> I thank all Deputies who took part in the debate on this Bill.  There is general agreement that An Bord Pleanála should be properly resourced at staff level and at board level to ensure that the planning appeal process operates in an efficient and effective manner.  I have explained the steps the Government has taken to provide extra resources at staff level during the past year.  The proposed strengthening of the membership of the board, for which this Bill provides, is a necessary complementary measure to the increase in staff resources.  I assure the House that my Department will continue to monitor the trends in the number of appeals and in the board's performance to ensure that the board can meet its objective of deciding on appeals within four months.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised other issues related to An Bord Pleanála and the planning system generally.  This Bill must be seen as a single focused urgent measure to deal with the current upsurge in planning appeals brought about by our economic success.  Other issues concerning the planning system will be given consideration as part of the comprehensive review of planning legislation in which I am now engaged.  My Department is examining all the submissions received as part of that review and I look forward to a constructive and healthy debate on my proposals when they are published later this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of indemnity to the staff of the board was raised by Deputy Howlin.  The provision of such statutory protection has been promised and will be contained in the next planning and development Bill to be brought before the House.  This is the Bill which will deal primarily with the protection of the architectural heritage and which I intend to submit to Government for approval to draft within the coming weeks.  I expect it to be before the House later this year. The Bill before us is urgent.  It contains only two sections and its sole purpose is to allow for an increase in the membership of An Bord Pleanála. In the light of this debate, I will consider if it is possible to include provision on indemnity in this Bill.  With regard to the planning review, I am happy to consider any views which the Members of this House express regarding the Planning Acts in general or An Bord Pleanála in particular.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes and others referred to a number of instances where they disagreed with the decisions of the board.  Some of the buildings to which the Deputy referred, such as the IFSC building and the Dublin Corporation headquarters, did not come before the board.  The IFSC building, for example, was part of the special scheme for the Custom House Docks area.  The buildings in question also have many admirers, as Deputy Howlin pointed out.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to expect that there would be unanimity throughout the country in relation to all planning decisions.  What is required is an independent consideration of the planning authorities' decisions.  We must be satisfied that the board applies the principles of administrative justice <Col N="1495" /> in arriving at its decisions.  However, we must accept that different people will arrive at different decisions based on the same facts.  The courts have accepted this and ruled that as long as the board adopts due process and bases its decisions on the facts before it, they will not question the planning merits of the board's decisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes also questioned the fact that the board overruled the inspector's report in 11 per cent of cases.  There is no point in having a board if it is bound to accept the recommendations of the inspector.  However, in overruling the recommendation of the inspector, the board must be satisfied that the facts before it support such a decision.  I understand fully the point made by Deputy Dukes and Deputy Howlin that where the board overturns the inspector's recommendation, it should explain why it has done so.  The board is required to give reasons for its decisions, but some might not be as clear as they could or should be.  In presenting its last annual report late last year, the chairman of the board acknowledged this criticism and said it would give clearer reasons in the future, which is a welcome move.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes inquired as to why there has been an increase in delays in dealing with planning appeals.  The reason is quite simple.  It reflects the growth in the economy generally. There has been a steady rise in the number of appeals coming before the board since mid-1995, an increase of 44 per cent over a two year period. This rise in appeals has matched the rise in planning applications generally, which have increased from 39,000 in 1993 to almost 51,000 in 1996.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin noted the greater sensitivity among the public to proposed development.  This in turn is reflected in the increase in the number of third party appeals being brought to An Bord Pleanála.  The latest figures show that these appeals have increased slowly but steadily from 25 per cent of all appeals in 1984 to a high of 39 per cent in 1997.  We all value the openness of the planning system in allowing for third party appeals.  This imposes a certain discipline on developers and planning authorities.  Equally, objectors must recognise the unique position granted to them under planning law and use their rights constructively at all times.  However, as Deputy Killeen noted, we must guard against vexatious and mischievous appeals which introduce unnecessary delay to the planning system.  Section 14 of the Planning Act, 1992, allows the board to dismiss appeals which it considers to be vexatious or without substance or foundation.  In 1996, 21 appeals were dismissed by the board for these reasons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes questioned why people who have no interest in a particular development can take an appeal to the board and asked whether any person from the EU could make an appeal. The position is that any person, regardless of interest, residential status or nationality, can make an appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  To require <Col N="1496" /> people to show an interest would be a major departure from the current system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin and Deputy Ryan raised the issue of lack of enforcement and I share their concerns.  The issue of enforcement will be carefully considered as part of the planning review. The present laws are quite complex and are not user friendly.  I hope that the enforcement provisions of the Acts can be simplified.  Deputy Howlin said that the lack of enforcement relates to a lack of resources at local authority level to inspect developments and take action when necessary.  I hope that the additional resources which I am providing for local authorities &mdash;£125 million in extra discretionary funding &mdash;will help them to provide better resources for their planning offices.  This would lead to a better planning service generally and to more effective enforcement in particular.</P>
    <P>One issue that has been raised as part of the planning review and by Deputy Ryan is the prohibition on planning authorities taking environmental pollution issues into account when they are deciding planning applications which also require an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.  This division of responsibilities was established in order to avoid duplication of effort between planning authorities and the EPA.  The IPC system is a relatively recent introduction and no doubt some of the initial difficulties will be ironed out in time.  We are actively examining this as part of the review on planning law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore asked why this Bill was taking priority over other worthy Bills which are to come before the House.  I cannot answer for other Departments and their priorities.  However, I can assure the Deputy that proposals for the traveller accommodation Bill have been finalised by the parliamentary draftsman.  It is expected that the text of the Bill will be submitted to the Government shortly for approval for publication.  Deputy Gilmore suggested that the construction industry had influenced the decision to bring forward a Bill to speed up planning appeals.  The proposal for an increase in the board membership came from the board.  The Oireachtas has placed a statutory obligation on An Bord Pleanála to consider planning appeals within four months.  It would be remiss of me as Minister of State and of the Oireachtas not to provide the board with the resources to meet the demands which the Oireachtas has placed on it.  That is why these provisions cannot wait for the introduction of a more comprehensive planning Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore also expressed concern about rising house prices.  I share the Deputy's concerns in relation to house prices.  There is an obligation on us, therefore, to ensure the planning system does not contribute to increasing house prices, for example, by delays in granting planning permission.  I expected the Deputy would support this Bill.  I have engaged consultants to study the issue of house prices and I expect a report from them at the end of March.  In the meantime, the <Col N="1497" /> Government has made available £15 million for the servicing of land.  Along with local funding, including contributions from developers, this should open up sites for building about 37,500 houses in the three years from 1998-2000.  This is roughly equivalent to one year's housing output. We will keep the situation under observation. The other issues raised by Deputy Gilmore about the construction industry are not within the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes also wondered why a Bill had to be brought before the Dáil to allow additional members to be appointed to the board.  He said the Minister should be able to increase board membership as the need arises.  The Deputy should be aware the Oireachtas decided that the appointment and number of board members should be regulated by a strict code, which reflects the important role the board has to play in planning and development and the need to ensure it has wide acceptance as being impartial and independent.  The board has managed to achieve this level of public support and we should not make changes which would detract from that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked if increasing the number of board members would automatically raise the number of members needed for a quorum.  The quorum of three is set in the 1983 Act and remains unchanged by the Bill.  The efficiency of the board should therefore be improved with the increased membership.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clune mentioned the need to establish special industrial zones where a pre-planning process can be gone through thereby allowing suitable industry to be set up with the minimum delay.  This issue is being examined as part of the review of planning legislation.  However, the issues are complex and will need careful consideration.  The situation in the UK is often mentioned but the use of special industrial zones there has had only mixed success.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche mentioned that some local authorities are using development contributions as a means of taxation.  Local authorities took in around £36 million in development contributions in 1996.  This forms a relatively small but essential contribution to the installation of costly infrastructure such as roads, sewage and water services, which benefit development.  Local authorities are restricted by law regarding the infrastructure for which they can charge.  However, development contributions are a legitimate way of assisting the provision of infrastructure which otherwise might not be built.  This issue is being examined as part of the current review of planning legislation to ensure charges are levied in as transparent a way as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies Howlin, Roche and others mentioned the problem of rogue builders and unfinished estates.  Deputies should bear in mind that it is up to each local authority to ensure that builders provide adequate bonds to enable estates to be finished.  The law, when applied properly, is sufficient in this regard and there is no excuse for <Col N="1498" /> local authorities allowing the problem of unfinished estates to arise in the first place.  Most local authorities have used these powers to their full effect.  However, I can promise Deputies that the issue of taking the past record of developers into account when granting future planning permissions will be examined in the context of the current planning review.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy states that only one in ten appeals succeeds but this is not the case.  In 1997 the decision of the planning authorities was confirmed in 42.5 per cent of cases.  It was amended in 34.5 per cent of cases and reversed in 23 per cent of cases.  The local authority decision is changed in some way in 57.5 per cent of cases coming before An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    <P>The use of section 4 motions was raised by a number of Deputies.  There has been a substantial decrease in such motions in recent years.  A three-quarters majority is now needed to carry such a motion and in 1996 only nine such motions were passed &mdash;five in Donegal, one in Leitrim, two in Kerry and one in Meath.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the need to provide adequate green and recreational areas in public and private housing developments.  I fully endorse the Deputy's view.  The circular sent to local authorities on the 1998 housing programme starts advised them that other than in exceptional circumstances, public housing schemes should not be built in public parks or designated recreational areas.  We had a debate on that issue before Christmas and it is interesting that the party opposite, which tabled the motion leading to that debate, has in its ranks Deputies who agree with the point of view I expressed in the House and in that circular.  It leads one to the conclusion that things are often said here for the sake of taking a party line and Deputies' real thoughts are not often expressed.  I was disappointed by the attitude taken during that debate, particularly by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>I confirm for Deputy Burke that the additional board members will be appointed from nominations made by the bodies represented on the four panels.  Because it will take time to go through the necessary consultation, the Bill sensibly allows for in-term appointments to be made from the staff of my Department or employees of the board.  Such in-term appointments will be for a maximum of nine months.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank all Deputies who contributed to this interesting debate.  I have not been able to respond to all the comments made but I assure Deputies their views will be taken into account in the review of the planning process as most comments were more relevant to that exercise than to the specifics of the legislation which has the general support of all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Standards are inadequate in many rural schools.  Recently in my constituency, a rat was found behind a photocopier in the principal's office of St. Mary's national school, Ballinagard, County Roscommon, a 40 pupil, two teacher school.  This should not have happened. The school is infested with vermin &mdash;26 portions of rat poison were eaten overnight but only one dead rat was found.  I am sure that rat did not eat all the poison unless it was extremely hungry. Parents are rightly horrified by this.</P>
      <P>The problem may not be as severe elsewhere but facilities for both primary and second level schools are inadequate, especially rural primary schools in areas where the population is falling. Neither the board of management nor the parents have the funds to keep the schools up to an adequate standard.  It is unfair to put pressure on the parents to provide matching funds for schools in such areas because they do not have the money.  The population has suffered a huge drop and many people are unemployed so they do not have access to the funding and cases like this arise.  Urban schools often have problems with inadequate heating.  This is not fair in these days of the Celtic tiger when so much funding is available.  We should tackle these problems.  I mentioned earlier the problem of pupils dropping out of school.  Such poor facilities do not help matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Deaf Society was in the Public Gallery earlier for the debate on this Bill but the debate on the last Bill ran late.  The society has serious concerns as regards the Bill because it feels the deaf are being left out.  Sign language is not being given primary language status and the society believes it should be.  It is unfair that deaf pupils are taught by non-deaf teachers &mdash;it is like a foreign teacher giving English lessons.  We will table amendments in this regard on Committee Stage. Deaf students need equality of opportunity with every other child in the education system.  The Department must recognise deafness is not just a problem with hearing, it is a matter of language <Col N="1500" /> and culture.  The deaf community should be recognised as a linguistic minority.</P>

      <P>that duty free shopping generates almost 2,000 jobs in Ireland,</P>
      <P>that revenue from duty free sales supports investment in infrastructure, vessels, and facilities by airport and ferry companies,</P>
      <P>that abolition of duty free sales may lead to higher travel costs to and from Ireland,</P>

      <P>Duty free sales at our airports, on our aeroplanes and on ferry services are a great benefit to the economy.  This facility has been enjoyed by the travelling public for many years. However, from the point of view of Aer Rianta and the companies which run the small regional airports, such sales are a vital source of income. Duty free shopping generates almost 2,000 jobs in Ireland.  The sales at airports increase the profits of Aer Rianta and are invested in developing airport infrastructure.  They are a very important component of Aer Rianta's balance sheet.  They are also a vital component, to a lesser extent, for the companies which run the regional airports.</P>
      <P>Duty free sales on aircraft help to keep fares down.  Fares would be higher if they were charged at the full economic cost without the subsidy of inflight duty free sales.  We all remember when fares were significantly higher, in real terms, than they are now.  We will quickly return to that position after 30 June 1999, when duty free sales are abolished in accordance with the agreement made by the Government in 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Duty free sales on car ferries are also very important.  We frequently think that duty free sales only occur in airports because the main lobby groups are centred on Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport, in particular.  However, duty free sales are vital in the maintenance of low cost, competitive ferry services to both the UK and the Continent.  Such sales reduce the cost of fares and <Col N="1501" /> are a very important component of the ferry companies' balance sheets.  We have all travelled on ferries and know the level of sales they have generated.  We also know the pressure experienced by ferry companies in the winter; for example, on the Rosslare to France route.  It will be very serious if their balance sheets are upset by the abolition of duty free sales.</P>
    <P>The history of the abolition of duty free sales is fairly well known.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance in 1991 he participated in the unanimous decision to abolish duty free sales from 30 June 1999.  He did not have to do so as he could have exercised Ireland's veto at that time, but he chose not to.  He should have exercised that veto because a very important national interest was involved.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not as simple now since the Taoiseach participated in that unanimous decision in 1991.  The Council of Ministers cannot return to the decision making process without the Commission initiating the action, which it is extremely reluctant to do.  No matter how much the Minister for Finance tries at ECOFIN, the decision cannot return to the agenda of any ECOFIN Council meeting unless the Commission takes the initiative.  According to my information, the Commission is not prepared to take that initiative.</P>
    <P>After I met representatives from Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport I wrote to several EU Commissioners.  I received a reply from Commissioner Padraig Flynn in the middle of January. While it is a very courteous letter, he sets out in the bleakest possible terms that the decision has been taken and, as far as the Commission is concerned, it is irreversible.  After the initial pleasantries he stated:</P>
    <P>I should first of all like to underline that the decision to put an end to duty and tax free sales was taken, unanimously, in 1991 by the Council of Ministers [at which the present Taoiseach represented Ireland] representing all of the member states.  In making this decision, the Council took account of the potential impact of the abolition of such sales on the business sector by granting a long transitional period until 1999.</P>
    <P>He further stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission shares the view of the Council that tax free selling within the European Union is incompatible with the idea of a Community-wide Single Market.  This is also the reason why member states do not allow duty free purchases within their own territory.</P>
    <P>He went on to say there would still be shops at airports which would have a captive market.</P>
    <P>However, the bottom line is that he is speaking not just for himself but on behalf of the whole Commission.  He says the Commission is sticking to the decision and will not take any initiative to reverse it.  He also speaks for the Council of Ministers as he stated &ldquo;The Commission shares the <Col N="1502" /> view of the Council&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance is a regular attender at the Council but Commissioner Flynn is speaking for him and saying there are no circumstances in which an initiative will be taken to change this decision.</P>
    <P>This week I received a long letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in which she reaffirmed the Commission's position and restated what Commissioner Flynn had informed me of the previous week.  The phraseology is somewhat similar in the key part of the letter.  She stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission shares the view of the Council as it has always considered tax free selling within the European Union to be incompatible with the idea of a Community-wide internal market.  This is also the reason why member states do not allow duty free purchases within their own territory.</P>
    <P>At present the Commission does not see the need to re-examine the matter of duty free sales again, since maintaining such sales within the Community beyond the transitional period would be contrary to the principles of the Single Market and might seriously distort competition, not only <i>vis-a-vis</i> business selling goods on which tax is paid, but more especially between the different forms of transport, depending on whether or not they offer duty free sales.</P>
    <P>I have seen hardline letters before but these are extremely hardline.  I cannot see a chink of light from the Commission.  The Commission will only respond to political action.</P>
    <P>The facts are clear.  The Council of Ministers, on the initiative of the Commission, took the decision in 1991.  Our man, the Taoiseach, was present as Minister for Finance and he did not raise his hand to object.  We had a veto at the time that decision was taken and it could not have gone through unless it was unanimous.  We have no such veto now because the decision has been taken and the Commission is holding the line.</P>
    <P>All we can do is exercise whatever political muscle this Government has in Europe to get the decision reversed.  So far, I have seen no indication that the Government seriously intends to do that.  I have seen various forms of bluff, first from the Minister and deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke, who speaks volumes about this issue but does not seem to know what course she is following.  In addition, the Minister for Finance, in response to questions last week, made it quite clear to me that his heart is not in this issue and that he does not really believe anything can be done.  Everybody would be happy if he could keep the ball in touch until after the by-elections.</P>

      <P>Keeping the ball in touch until after the by-elections is costing £40,000.  The Minister commissioned consultants to examine all aspects of duty free, to report to him on the economic importance of it and to inform us of what <Col N="1503" /> we know already at a cost of £40,000.  This is a small country and we all have political supporters, friends and colleagues working in the ferry companies and at the airports.  There is no problem gaining access to information or in quantifying the importance of duty free to the economy. Because of the by-elections, the Minister is wasting £40,000 of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>The SIPTU members to whom I have spoken have a clear view on what should be done and that it is not in the interests of its members, communities or the economy that this decision should be allowed to stand.  My principal reason for tabling this motion is to allow the Government to take some political initiative to lever the Commission from its present state of inactivity so that we will have another opportunity to reconsider the issues.</P>
      <P>Until now the Minister and his colleagues have gone to Brussels and mentioned this issue out of the corners of their mouths, but they are not applying any political pressure.  The Minister informed the House previously that the Taoiseach said in the course of a long speech at the Luxembourg summit that we were a bit worried about duty free.  There was no attempt to take an initiative.  There have been passing references by the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Enterprise and the Taoiseach at respective councils purely for the record &mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and to enable them to tell the Dáil they raised this matter in Europe.  That is all that is happening.  Nothing serious is being done about the issue of duty free and the Minister should take an initiative.</P>
      <P>I asked that the Taoiseach take this upon himself because after all, he agreed to its abolition and failed to exercise the veto when he had the opportunity to do so.  The Irish initiative will not be taken seriously unless the Taoiseach's position is seen to be reversed.  He must raise this issue with heads of state across Europe.  Ireland will be hit harder than other EU countries as the bulk of our travel is to and from EU countries.  With the exception of travel to the United States, Irish citizens travelling outside the community go through London or one of the continental airports.  We do not get the benefit of long haul travel duty free sales outside the Community.  We are confined to what is being abolished in terms of air travel and with the exception of the runs to the United States, we are at a serious disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not taken serious steps to reverse this decision since becoming Taoiseach. This motion calls on him to contact all heads of Government in the Community to get this issue back on the agenda so that the Commission will take the initiative to allow this matter to be discussed once more at ECOFIN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach, who was Minister for Finance in the crucial years when this decision to abolish duty free was taken, is guilty of a double betrayal of Irish interests because he agreed, politically and through the directive, to the abolition of duty free services.  According to my information, when the matter was discussed in November 1991 and the following year, Ireland not only agreed to the abolition of duty free but said five years was a sufficient lead-in time to prepare for its abolition.  At the same time, the UK looked for a 15 year preparation time and other EU members, such as Spain and Portugal, looked for more than five years.  I understand the six and a half year lead-in time came about by adding the number of years each country said would be needed for them to prepare and by dividing it by the number of countries concerned.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise are trying to hide their blushes and shame by pretending they are doing something about this issue.  If we had used our veto or, at the very least, gone along with the UK's request for a 15 year lead-in period, it would have been the year 2007 when harmonisation would have occurred, many other things would have happened and we might have been able to consider looking at the issue, but Ireland caved in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Ireland had refused to go along with the decision or if it had agreed to 15 years, we would not face the loss of 2,000 jobs.  In my neighbourhood, 200 jobs will be lost at Dublin airport alone not to mention the loss of jobs in the ferry companies and those which produce materials for <Col N="1505" /> duty free.  Aer Rianta, which has done a tremendous job in promoting itself in the duty free sector, estimates that it will lose £40 million in the year 2000, the first year of the abolition.  Some £30 million of that £40 million is profit.  That £30 million is spread throughout the services Aer Rianta provides to keep the costs down, including landing charges and services generally to passengers who use Dublin, Shannon and other airports. That profit will be gone and I do not have to tell this or any Minister for Finance worth his salt what that will mean.</P>
    <P>At a theoretical level, economists might have argued that duty free services were in contradiction to the single market.  However, the case for the abolition of duty free was made in conjunction with the wider debate on the harmonisation of tax and VAT rates and that duty free would be abolished when that happened.  We do not have harmonisation across Europe so the reason, if there was one for abolishing duty free in 1991-2, does not exist.  I do not know why the Minister does not understand that and do something about it.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish duty free was taken without any prior study, no understanding of the effect of such abolition and no commitment to do a study.  It was taken almost at a whim at a council meeting and without anybody examining the issue.  The Taoiseach is embarrassed, hiding his shame and is trying to fool the people into thinking his Government is trying to do something to reverse that decision.  I am convinced the public relations spinners have been told to keep this going for a while and by June 1999 people will have forgotten about it.  If they pretend to be doing something about it, people will forget when the big bureaucrats in the Commission say &ldquo;Tough, you did not do enough.&rdquo; We will not forget about it.</P>
    <P>I am convinced the Minister does not yet believe we need to save duty free because he is half-hearted, has shown less than robust support over the last few weeks and has demonstrated less than robust actions at European level to convince other Ministers for Finance of the damage to Ireland if duty free is abolished.  The Minister has failed to convince our Commissioner who is there to look after Ireland's interests of the need to get the Commission to make a proposal on the matter.</P>

      <P>The ECOFIN Council of Ministers cannot put forward a proposal, it must be tabled by the Commission.  We need an advocate at the table.  Commissioner Neil Kinnock is very interested in having the decision overturned but he needs friends at the table, which is where Commissioner Flynn should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last June the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Alan Dukes, got agreement at the Transport Ministers Council to have a study carried out on the effects of the loss of duty free sales.  Commissioner Kinnock was requested to carry out the study but unfortunately he refused to do so on the basis that the matter was under the jurisdiction of Commissioner Monti.  However, Commissioner Monti refused to carry out the study because the <Col N="1507" /> abolition of duty free sales was his baby and he felt that if he carried it out it would look as if he was giving into a lobby group.  That report was never carried out.</P>
    <P>No other policy issue would be decided without numerous examinations, studies and discussion.  It is very difficult to get decisions made in Europe because of the number of studies that have to be carried out.  Yet this decision, which will adversely affect our national interest, was made without the then Government showing any interest in it.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish duty free sales was taken in a cavalier fashion.  Why did no one shout stop at that stage?  The Department of Transport would have been clearly briefed on the advantages of the duty free industry to the economy.  It would also have known the number of jobs dependent on it, the number of suppliers and manufacturers making duty free products and that travel prices were kept competitive because the profits made from duty free sales were ploughed back into airports.  Why was there such silence when this proposal which was clearly damaging to Ireland was being agreed?</P>
    <P>A number of our partners in Europe, principally Greece, Spain, Portugal and the Nordic countries, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, are deeply concerned about this matter and have expressed either publicly or privately their desire to have duty free sales retained.  Clearly Spain and Portugal where 80 per cent of tourists arrive by air will suffer great losses.  I call on the Minister to give a commitment that he will mobilise his fellow Ministers for Finance in an effort to convince the Commission to put forward a proposal to retain duty free sales.  The only way we can get the Commission to make this decision is by having this kind of solidarity.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to say she has raised the issue at a Council meeting.  I received a report on that meeting for which no preparation was done.  The matter was raised so that the Minister could say in a press statement that it was raised.  However, I know from experience that these meetings require background work and informal discussions with officials and Ministers from various countries.  In this way a Minister can secure support from other Ministers for a matter of importance to his or her country.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say she raised the matter but cannot do anything about it.  This will not save the duty free industry. The Dáil must send a clear, unanimous message that it wants the duty free industry to be retained. A motion was recently passed by the Upper and Lower Houses of the Bundestag and this has put pressure on Chancellor Kohl to raise the issue in Brussels.  I hope he does this as it is extremely important from our point of view to have German support for the retention of the duty free industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> Between 70 per cent and 85 per cent of the current sales of the most popular duty free items such as alcohol and cigarettes will disappear with the abolition of duty free sales.  Even if there are duty fee and tax paid retail outlets at airports they will substitute for no more than one-third of the current sales, thereby leading to a reduction of approximately 70 per cent in profits.  Airport charges will also increase.  Air Rianta estimates that its airport charges will increase by up to 50 per cent, while the increase at regional airports will be greater.  The financing of investment in airports will be very difficult following the loss of duty free facilities.  . There will also be staff costs because of a loss of sales commissions.  This will be particularly serious for low cost scheduled airlines where cost increases of up to £10 per passenger could result.  The argument that ordinary retail outlets will provide shopping at airports and that people will automatically switch to buying in such outlets is false.  This can be seen if one looks at the experience in America where there is no duty free facility available to people travelling between states.  Pittsburgh airport has 65 retail shops and it is estimated that the average spend in these by passengers is only $7 or £3.  The average spend by a passenger in Europe is £13.</P>
    <P>At present the travelling public can avail of duty free items, thereby availing of the lower cost of travelling as a result of the profits made.  We now hear that the Commission might allow countries, as a kind of sop, to introduce national subsidies for airlines or ferry companies which will lose out as a result of the abolition of duty free. However, this is a complete contradiction to what is happening in Europe.  If a Government gives a subsidy to an airline or ferry company all taxpayers will have to fund it.  At present it is the travelling public which funds the duty free sales profits, thereby gaining from the facility.</P>
    <P>Consumer research indicates that up to 40 per cent of the products currently sold in duty and tax free outlets will not be purchased in the event of the abolition of duty free sales.  This means that manufacturers who supply goods to duty free outlets will have to reduce their input and the number of their employees, which will lead to a subsequent loss to the economy in many areas.  For example, it is estimated that the sale of Bailey's products, which were launched as duty free items, within the EU account for 10 per cent of total sales, while Irish Distillers' sales of duty free products amount to 13 per cent.  Thirty-three per cent of the world duty and tax free trade will go with the abolition of duty free sales.  In excess of 150 companies sell their products in duty free facilities.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is a crucial part of the economic infrastructure of Dublin North.  I cannot over-emphasise the damage which will be caused to many thousands of families in this region if duty free is abolished.  Businesses in Swords, Malahide, Portmarnock, Lusk, Rush and Skerries depend for their livelihoods on income generated by Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> Fine Gael recently carried out a straw poll on duty free sales and found that for more than 40 per cent of those questioned it is either the first or second most crucial issue in the Dublin North by-election.  The people in Dublin North are aware of the damage that would be done by the abolition of duty free sales.  When Fianna Fáil meets them at the doors during the forthcoming by-elections &mdash;this will also apply in Limerick &mdash; they will be vociferous in letting them know they are very unhappy with what it did in 1991 and 1992 and that they are equally unhappy with the lack of robustness in trying to save duty free sales. The Government amendment is a disgrace.  It means nothing.  There is no anxiety behind the action taken in Europe.  It is time the Taoiseach put pep in his step.</P>

Kerry airport was developed in 1994 at a cost of about £12.5 million.  There are 25 people directly employed at the airport and 25 in ancillary jobs such as taxis, car hire and so on.  The value of duty free sales to the airport is approximately £200,000, the equivalent of about 15 jobs.  If that income is lost, where will the revenue be found to ensure the viability of the airport?  There is no alternative source of income.  There is not enough throughput to get the necessary revenue from other retail sources.  The airport will not be in a position to get extra money from the airlines because it has already signed long-term contracts and the airlines cannot afford to provide extra money because air travel is so competitive.  I ask the Minister, as I did last week, to consider providing EU funding or national subsidies for airports such as Kerry County Airport.</P>
      <P>In regard to the £5 Government tax imposed on people who travel outside the country &mdash; people travelling to Great Britain must also pay £10 tax to the British Government &mdash;serious consideration should be given to abolishing that tax so that airports such as that in Farranfore remain competitive.  Kerry County Airport is very important in terms of regional development.  It has played a significant role in the revival of the Kerry area.  Without the airport the area would be severely disadvantaged because of its peripherality.  Many people, foreigners and locals, commute from there to Dublin and back each day. The issue of duty free sales may have been disregarded in 1991, but it has major significance in terms of retail policy within the EU.</P>

      <P>The duty free and tax free sales business is almost 50 years old.  In that time it has become a global industry, driven by Europe <Col N="1510" /> where it started, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of all sales.  It is a vibrant and popular business which makes an important economic contribution to all member states.  The abolition of duty free and tax free sales would affect thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly, as it results in a reduction in travel costs and higher quality travel facilities for air and sea travellers.  It contributes to economic development in tourism, which is significant because of the boom in tourism at present.  The reduction in access fares has played a key part in initiating and consolidating the tourism drive.  The abolition of duty free and tax free sales would reverse that making it more difficult for tourism to expand in future.</P>
      <P>While the proposal would reduce the profitability of Irish-owned airports, airlines and ferries, resulting in higher fares, it would benefit the Exchequer as the tax base would be extended to duty and tax free purchases by travellers within the EU.  The abolition of duty free sales would have a great effect on many people, particularly employees at air and sea ports.  As previous speakers said, it would be a major mistake and I appeal to the Minister at this late stage to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>The proposal to abolish duty free sales will result in the loss of 2,000 jobs.  I ask the Taoiseach to contact his EU comrades, particularly Commissioner Flynn, and ask them to save duty free sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months the Government provided 50 per cent funding to Knock airport and the airport had to match that funding.  However, 75 per cent funding was provided for Galway.  Why did Mayo have to provide 50 per cent of funds while Galway had to provide only 25 per cent?  Donegal airport also had to find 50 per cent of the funds. Whether Commissioner Flynn is used in the line out, at full forward or full back &mdash;he has the <Col N="1511" /> height and the strength &mdash;I hope he has the ability to save the day on this issue.</P>
    <P>All the regional airports, Knock, Donegal, Sligo and Kerry, as well as Shannon and Dublin airports are in trouble.  It will take much effort to save the 2,000 jobs involved and I call on the Taoiseach to take action to do so.  People who travel to Scotland, England and elsewhere look forward to buying duty free goods, whether it is perfume, whiskey or cigarettes.  If duty free sales are abolished many people will not want to travel.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue.  I agree with Deputy Owen that when Fianna Fáil stands on the door-steps in Dublin and Limerick the people will tell them that their jobs are at stake and there is no alternative employment.  Many airports depend on profits from duty free sales to subsidise the salaries of their employees.  The Taoiseach and the Minister must reverse this decision because this issue will not go away.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the efforts made by Ireland, at EU level, to have the issue of intra-European duty free and tax free shopping re-examined by the European Commission and Council, and endorses the action taken by the Minister for Finance to carry out a study, by independent consultants, of the impact on Ireland arising from the ending of intra-European duty free and tax free shopping.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In addressing this debate I reaffirm the importance of duty free and tax free sales to Ireland, which has been in the forefront of the campaign to have this decision revisited.  No country has done more than we have and no Government has raised it more often we have.</P>
      <P>However, the Opposition claim we are not doing enough.  I am glad the motion allows me to remind this House that our programme for Government, on which we were elected, sets out our commitment to resist the EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999.  We are fully committed to that aim.  I and my colleagues will continue to keep the issue of duty free sales on the agenda.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, continues to lobby her colleagues on the EU Council of Ministers.  The Taoiseach also raised this issue at the major EU summit on employment last year and we will continue to raise it as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts by Irish Governments past and present have not so far been echoed in other EU states.  Apart from one intervention by Finland, at EU Council of Ministers level, Ireland has <Col N="1512" /> made all the running.  The Government has done far more in a short time in office than the previous Government.  Indeed the danger is that this subject is being seen in Europe as a peculiarly Irish problem, and one which only the Irish are worried about.  It may be that other countries are only coming to identify the problems more slowly than we have.</P>
    <P>As has been explained to this House on many occasions, the EU plans to abolish duty free sales for all travel within the EU have been enacted into law.  Changing the law will be extremely difficult.  First we must convince the EU Commission that such a change is necessary because the EU procedures only allow the Council of Ministers to adopt measures on the basis of proposals put to them by the Commission.  Preparing and placing draft directives before the Council is the sole responsibility of the Commission under the terms of the EU treaty.  Before I and my colleagues in ECOFIN can even begin to consider the possibility of reversing the present decision, or extending the time period for duty free to remain available, we will first need a proposal from the Commission.  Without it we will have nothing to adopt.  European Finance Ministers have plenty of issues on their agenda and they are reluctant to hold a discussion when there is no proposal before them.</P>
    <P>Getting a proposal from the Commission is only the first hurdle; all member states must then vote in favour of the proposal.  As a taxation matter, any change in an adopted directive will require the unanimous agreement of all member states.  Even one member state in opposition would cause any such proposal to fall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I stress this procedure because I often get the impression that some in the duty free sales lobby think it is a straightforward matter; it is not.  Lest there be any doubt, the initiative for any proposals must come first from the Commission.  The Commission has, until now, shown no willingness to initiate any.  Naturally, the more Heads of Government and Finance Ministers call for a discussion of this subject, the greater is the pressure on the Commission to bring forward a proposal, but I sometimes wonder if the pivotal role of the Commission in the handling of EU business is fully understood.  It is the Commission which must be persuaded in the first instance, not the Government, Finance Ministers or Heads of Government.  The Commission must be persuaded of the need to keep duty free sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background it must be recognised that the task of achieving a change to the legally enacted agreement to end the facility for duty free sales for intra-EU travel within the next 17 months is a challenge, but not one on which we have given up and not one on which the duty free <Col N="1513" /> lobby sales groups have given up either.  The Government will continue to focus attention on the campaign in Europe but we need allies.  We need support from other states and, in general, we are not getting it.</P>
    <P>The Commission has consistently argued that duty free sales are not appropriate for a single market without internal frontiers.  Why, it says, should such facilities be available for air travel, but not for cross frontier car travel?  As a final concession, it agreed to grant a seven and a half year delay in the ending of duty free sales to allow the operators sufficient time to diversify their activities.  It is its firm view that, rather than try to become less dependent on duty free sales and to phase down their operations, the industry has become even more dependent on duty free sales than it was seven years ago.  New duty free shops have been built, existing ones have been expanded and turnover has increased.  The profit margins on this activity are high.</P>
    <P>Although it originally intended to conduct an EU wide study into the economic consequences of ending the duty free facility, the Commission refused to undertake such a study.  It holds the view that the decision has already been taken, it has been enacted into law and no purpose would be served by undertaking such a study now. Indeed, it further argues that to conduct such a study would only raise the expectations of the industry that a further change might be considered, at a time when the industry should be devoting all its efforts to minimising the consequences of a long announced date.  The Commission is determined to end duty free sales, and this must be acknowledged by all who approach it at this stage.</P>
    <P>The absence of any wider EU analysis work is one of the key reasons Ireland has commissioned its own study.  Although this will only address the issues for Ireland, it will none the less provide useful pointers for a wider European debate.  It may well provide a useful vehicle in reactivating the debate at ECOFIN because ECOFIN Ministers tend to prefer hard facts and figures to rhetoric.  This study will help with the facts and figures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan probably understands the issue and is aware of the legalities of the Commission.  However, Deputy Owen either does not know the realities involved or chooses to ignore them.  She appears to have a marked lack of knowledge of how the Commission and the EU work, otherwise she would not have uttered some of her more extreme comments in this debate.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Finance I have explained to the House on a number of occasions the legal realities of the matter and I have again outlined them here.  There is no point in engaging in debate without knowing the facts and knowing who can change this decision.</P>
    <P>Since his appointment as Oppositions spokesman on Finance, Deputy Noonan appears to think he can look into my heart when, following <Col N="1514" /> the example of Eamon De Valera, he looks into his heart.  In doing so he tells me that I am not putting my heart into this debate.  While his colleagues may not understand the situation, Deputy Noonan is probably aware of the realities involved in changing the present position.  Perhaps my repeated explanation of them in this House has given some people the opportunity to say I am not fully committed to getting the decision on duty free shopping reversed.  I am committed, but as with most aspects of life, I prefer to deal with the realities and, once again, I am spelling them out here.</P>
    <P>The issue of the future of duty free shopping is extremely emotive.  The demonstration held by duty free operators in Brussels last year is an example.  As we move into the final furlong, we must consider our strategy carefully.  We cannot continue to seek a moral victory in isolation.  We need to be supported by others, however, the airport and ferry operators and their employees in other EU states do not appear to have mobilised the necessary support at political level.  In Ireland there is no shortage of effort and I hope the cross-party support will continue, notwithstanding the impending by-elections.</P>
    <P>As further evidence of the strength of feeling generated by this subject and the significant amount of interest and concern, I received a number of representations from people who may be directly affected by the abolition of duty free sales.  However, at the same time, there is much confusion surrounding the topic and, in attempting to present the issue in headlines, some false impressions and misunderstandings may be creeping into the debate.  For example, it is easy to overlook the fact that duty free facilities will still be available for travel to destinations outside the EU.  This is a point of particular importance not only to Shannon Airport, but also to Dublin. Only intra-EU travel will be affected.  This may be of little consolation to those operators who supply solely EU travellers, but even this angle may be helpful to the campaign in that it acts to discourage visits to EU states as against competing non-EU holiday destinations in the period post-1999.  After 1999, Aer Lingus, which celebrates 40 years of trans-Atlantic service this year, and other operators to the United States will continue to be able to offer duty free to their passengers.</P>
    <P>The duty free industry has moved on considerably from its effective beginnings in a small shop at Shannon Airport in 1947, over 50 years ago. Although it may appear as a facility that has always been available to EU travellers, duty free and tax free sales were not available to travellers between Britain and Ireland until 1978, less than 20 years ago.  Today, according to some reports, the world-wide total of duty free sales through all channels is estimated to exceed $20 billion.  Of this, the volume of activity is estimated to have reached a level of almost 6 billion ECU in Europe in 1996 alone and in Ireland it is now estimated to be approximately IR£100 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1515" /> At these levels, it is easy to appreciate the significant contribution that the profit from duty free sales makes towards the overall profitability of the travel industry.  Indeed, the income from duty free sales is now recognised as playing a central role in the commercial finances of some transport operators.  More detailed information will be available from the study.  I will illustrate this last point with items drawn from the 1996 annual report of the BAA, the UK airport group which operates the three main London airports and some others.  In 1996, over 700,000 bottles of liquor were sold in Heathrow terminal two, together with 83 million cigarettes, enough to cover a distance of over 4,500 miles, for example, from London to Barbados.  A bottle of whiskey is sold every six seconds at a BAA airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would probably be buried in a suitable state of glee.</P>
      <P>Given the scale of operation and importance to the travel industry, how did the then 12 EU member states agree to its abolition in 1991?  Again, there are many misconceptions.  First, and most importantly, the decision to abolish duty free sales was not taken in isolation.  It was only one part of the package of tax measures agreed to in 1992 as part of the preparations for the creation of the Single Market.  If Ireland and other states had not once before taken up the interests of the duty free operators, duty free sales would have ended on 31 December 1992.  The extension of the date to 1999 would not have happened without us, but to call at that time for a permanent retention would have led to deadlock in bringing about the tax measures necessary for the Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the arguments being put forward for the abolition of duty free sales by the EU Commission.  As it is not represented here, it is important its reasoning is summarised.  The most significant point, in its view, is that the continuation of a tax free trading facility is incompatible with a Single Market without internal frontiers.  It is also asserted that the tax break on duty and excise free sales is no more than a massive subsidy to certain sections of the travel industry which in turn benefits disproportionately the regular traveller, who is predominantly middle class. This, it is argued, represents an element of unfair competition with the tax and duty paid sales in the high street and distorts the efficient location of economic activity.  The Commission puts forward <Col N="1516" /> the argument that if a service is not profitable except by a tax subsidy, why should the continuation of that tax subsidy be used to help prop up an essentially uneconomic activity?  The point has also been made that duty free sales encourage the consumption of cut price cigarettes and alcohol, which have wider health implications.  It becomes more difficult to argue in Europe for a continuation of a facility that encourages increased consumption of cheap cigarettes and alcohol at the same time as Ministers are agreeing to a ban on tobacco advertising.  Should we give up?  The answer is obviously no. The Government, as did its predecessor, acknowledges the importance of duty free sales and supports the arguments put forward for their retention.</P>
    <P>The argument for the retention of duty free sales has been clearly put as follows: if it is not broken, do not fix it.  That sums up one approach. Many take the view that the chance to avail of opportunities to buy free of tax do no great harm and it has now become a well established part of travel.  Many have experienced delays in airport departure lounges and the opportunity to browse through the duty free shop provides welcome relief from the terminal queue.  However, at a more serious level, operators have been using the profits from duty free sales to cross subsidise other activities.  For example, the cost of airport landing charges is lower as a result of profits from duty free sales and, as a result, so are basic ticket prices.  The extent to which these prices are lower can be argued, but everyone would probably accept the fact that operators are able to offer lower ticket prices as a result of the profit they make from duty free sales.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the profits have been used to help finance capital investment projects.  Aer Rianta is building new terminal facilities at Dublin and the sea transport industry has been able to use such profits to help its investment programme.  However, not only does the profit help the investment programme for some marginal routes, and in particular some of our regional airports, the availability of duty free sales is a key element in making any money at all.  A central argument for retention is that it helps to keep the cost of travel down and of particular significance for an island nation such as Ireland is that it keeps the access cost down generally.  As a tribute to our tourism industry, the number of people who choose to visit Ireland has been steadily increasing over the years and last year a record number of over 10 million passengers used Dublin Airport alone.  The number is expected to continue to increase.</P>
    <P>Ferry operators are still faced with a business that is strongly seasonal in nature and the potential catchment areas for some of the ferry routes are fairly small.  Without the duty free facility, the prospects for some route operators, particularly those not operating on the central corridor from Dublin Bay, must give some cause for concern. In this case, the availability of duty free helps to <Col N="1517" /> keep services operating in winter which might not otherwise continue on a year round basis.</P>
    <P>Economic activity underpins employment opportunities not only in the duty free stores but also in the supply and distribution chain and, by keeping the cost of access down, employment in the tourism industry generally is maintained.  We should not underestimate the importance of employment in a Europe where the total number of unemployed is higher than any Government would wish.  As has been reported, it was in the context of the EU summit on employment late last year that the Taoiseach specifically raised the importance of duty free sales.  This was a measure of the importance Ireland gave the issue.  The summit was the subject of debate in the House and most of the comments related to the question of duty free sales which was raised by Ireland there and not the issues raised by others at the summit or in the preparatory papers.  The Opposition probably would prefer to forget that point because it does not sit easily with its claims of Government inaction that the Taoiseach raised it so visibly in that way.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the more member states that call for a retention of duty free sales, the greater the chance of persuading the Commission to reconsider the issue.  The problem is our European partners are much more reticent on this topic.  As was mentioned in the Dáil last November, when Ireland held the EU Presidency in 1996, my predecessor, now the leader of the Labour Party, properly raised the issue of an EU wide study at ECOFIN.  He did not succeed in convincing the Commission or our European partners to agree to this and the support he received as a well respected President of ECOFIN was limited to the one or two other states that traditionally have been interested in this subject.  The vast majority of states and all the big EU states, did not give their support.  To date I see little hard evidence of increasing support among European Governments for any retention beyond 1999.  Ministers with specific functional responsibility for transport and tourism in some member states are more supportive than other ministers.  They hear the problems from the ferry operators and the airlines.  This situation has been confirmed by the efforts of the media, especially RTE, to assess support at political level in Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland was the first into the fray on the duty free issue and probably the first also to seek to assess the direct impact by a study to be undertaken by independent consultants.  I understand that some other States are assessing in detail the likely implications for them of the ending of duty free sales.  The Baltic States and Germany are also likely to be disproportionately affected if the volume of ferry traffic on those routes is reduced as a result of increasing fare prices.</P>
    <P>As I have already reported to this House, in the lead-in to the UK Presidency, my officials discussed the UK's priorities with that country while <Col N="1518" /> it had the chair of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers.  During these discussions the importance to Ireland of the duty free issue was pointed out. However, from these discussions and also judging from a reply in the UK Parliament in December, the UK would not, at present, appear to see the future of duty free sales as a priority issue in their Presidency.  At a recent meeting on other excise matters the UK chair reported that they had no specific plans to bring forward the issue of duty free facilities.  It seems likely that they would have formed this opinion after consulting other member states, who see the priority being the arrangements for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>There are necessary limits to the amount of action one country can take on its own.  Our position is extremely well known to the Commission and to our partners.  Despite this, and with a continuing lack of support, particularly from the larger EU states, we will continue to keep the duty free issue on the agenda.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, my officials have met with counterparts in the UK Presidency, but it is unlikely to be productive for me to return to ECOFIN again without some firm facts to support the consequences for Ireland of the ending of duty free sales.  I will therefore wait until I have studied the consultants' report before deciding how best to take this matter forward.</P>

      <P>If the operators who have given sensitive economic information in relation to their own activities have no objection to their contributions becoming public, I will publish it.  I expect to have that report shortly and it will, no doubt, lead to further discussions in the House.</P>
      <P>In my judgment, our case will be significantly stronger if I can support it with hard facts obtained by an independent study.  Unsubstantiated claims will be ignored by the Commission .</P>
      <P>As an island on the periphery of the EU we are particularly vulnerable to travel costs.  We have one of the most open economies in Europe and are totally dependent on air and sea transport links for trade.  All our trade depends on air and sea freight and the tourism industry is a valuable contribution to local economies and employment in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already mentioned the investment supported by the profits generated by duty free sales. The shipping industry in particular faces a number of challenges over the next few years.  New safety requirements agreed in Europe may well <Col N="1519" /> require additional investment, and investment in new ships and port facilities will meet the growing demand for travel to Ireland.  To justify this continuing investment the industry needs to be sure of the demand, and if the increase in the cost of travel is likely to depress that demand, there could be a question raised as to whether to proceed with investment decisions.</P>
    <P>Time is short.  What the argument needs now are firm facts on which to base any next stage in the attempt to persuade the Commission to put forward fresh proposals.  I expect to receive shortly the independent report I have commissioned into the consequences for Ireland of the ending of duty free sales.  Once I have studied this report I will be in a better position to assess how to take this issue forward.</P>
    <P>Although we are committed to trying to obtain a change of heart on the duty free issue, it would not be right for me to end this statement without saying that, in reality, our chances of success are limited.  However, we will continue trying.  As can be demonstrated at race tracks every day, sometimes the outsider wins.</P>

      <P>When I saw the text of this motion over the weekend I was surprised because for the last fortnight I have been participating in the Committee Stage debate on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill.  Deputies Stagg and Yates had the opportunity to support the Minister for Public Enterprise's efforts to ensure the extension of duty free facilities.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen spoke at length about the by-election in my constituency.  There has always been cross-party support there for the fight to ensure the retention of duty free sales.  Over the weekend I spoke to my constituents who work for Aer Rianta and the ferry companies, and they believe strongly in the words of Deputy Ring: we should all be wearing one green jersey and should be fighting for this cause as one nation.  It is a national issue, but it is not our Ministers we must convince.  As the Minister for Finance said, we must convince members of the Commission and other heads of Government.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage of the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill I spoke on behalf of those who work in and supply duty free shops. There are 600 companies which supply duty free shops and those small companies' workers are worried that this facility will not be renegotiated and extended.</P>
      <P>One of the success stories of the improvement in the economy is the low air fare structure that has allowed record numbers of people to visit Ireland.  There is agreement that costs will increase if duty free facilities are eliminated and there will be a detrimental effect on tourism and the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has also been a success story.  It has been able to pay for development of its own infrastructure out its own pocket.  Profits on duty free sales account for approximately half of Aer <Col N="1520" /> Rianta's profits.  The company is spending £90 million on upgrading airport facilities to accommodate the tourists who are arriving in record numbers.</P>
    <P>The duty free issue is of concern to the ferry companies as well as the airports.  It has been said to me that we should not be arguing about who has done more for the retention of duty free.  We should table an all-party motion of support for the Government of the day in its efforts to ensure the retention of duty free facilities.  Everybody should support this cause, as it is in the interests of many who depend on duty free shops for a living.</P>
    <P>We must continue our efforts.  Some of the founding principles of the EU relate to job creation, but 140,000 to 150,000 people may lose their jobs in Europe because of the abolition of duty free sales.  Why can this matter not be reviewed?  I referred earlier to cost structures.  It may not be admitted, but it is a fact that many of the low fare companies rely to a large extent on duty free sales.  The abolition of duty free will have a detrimental effect on their profit base.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for continuing the fight against the abolition of duty free at national and European level.  I am pleased the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, will meet her counterpart in Germany to explore Germany's recognition of the need for such an extension.  It is the strong view of those I represent in Dublin North that this motion should not condemn anybody, there should be all-party support for the fight against the abolition of duty free.</P>

      <P>If there were any doubt about the future of duty free or whether the decision made in 1991 could be reversed, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, with his well known directness and honesty gave it the kiss of death tonight.  From any fair reading of his speech, the fight is over.  The absence from the proceedings tonight of the champion of duty free, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is also instructive.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance stated that the package of taxation included the duty free sales decision.  A reply to a question my party tabled to the Department of Finance today stated that the decision to abolish duty free in 1999 was not contingent on a programme of tax harmonisation. The idea that has been sold that we will lose the whole package if duty free is not abolished is not the opinion of the Department of Finance.  This was stated in a reply today</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last autumn, during the Second Stage debate on the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill many Deputies spoke at length about their concerns at the proposed abolition of duty free.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to draw attention to this vital matter again and I thank the Fine Gael Party for tabling the motion.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has been particularly vocal on this matter and I fully support her actions in trying <Col N="1521" /> to reverse the 1991 ECOFIN decision.  This Government has been adept at making the u-turn an essential part of Government policy and I welcome the Minister's efforts to have this <i>modus operandi</i> raised to the European level.  However, I do not hold out much hope for her efforts.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed at a meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on 7 January.  During that debate the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, indicated that there was an earlier decision to scrap duty free from 1992 onwards.  She undertook to have her officials examine the papers from that time to demonstrate the point and to make the papers available to the committee.  No papers have been produced to date.  However, I have carried out my own research and it appears the Minister is wrong and may have inadvertently misled the House.  The position is crystal clear and the Minister for Finance's speech also made it clear.  The original proposal from the Commission was to abolish duty free from 1992 onwards.  That was not a decision, it was only a proposal and required the unanimous agreement of the Finance Ministers to give it effect.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, had the power to veto that Commission proposal.  Instead, he accepted a modified proposal to abolish duty free in 1999.  He also had a veto on that proposal, but he did not use it.  He voted for it.  That is why we are where we are now on this issue.  This chicken is about to come home to roost with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>The ECOFIN decision of 1991 was a disgrace and the Taoiseach must take full responsibility for his actions on that occasion.  He had a veto on that fateful night, but for some reason, which to the best of my knowledge he has never fully explained, he choose to abolish the Irish duty free industry rather than ruffle the feathers of his fellow Finance Ministers around the table.  The Taoiseach has always traded on his reputation as a consensus seeker, but on that night he elevated this quality to the point of absurdity.</P>
    <P>I read with interest in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Saturday that the Taoiseach currently employs seven people in his media monitoring unit at an estimated cost of £130,000 per annum.  Perhaps he should consider diverting a small amount of that sum away from his spindoctors in Mount Street to do an assertiveness training course before he signs away the future of Irish workers again.</P>
    <P>The decision to abolish duty free is adhered to by many EU policy makers with a near religious fervour.  It is an irrational, destructive and unnecessary policy decision, but the mandarins in Brussels, and Commissioner Monti in particular, are determined to implement this nonsense.  The EU abolition of duty free will produce not one positive benefit for any EU citizen.  It will bring inconvenience, hardship and misery to thousands of citizens, yet the Commission is intent on implementing the decision.</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming Amsterdam Treaty referendum we will again hear calls for the promotion <Col N="1522" /> of a citizen's Europe.  If the Commission is intent on destroying a European-wide industry for the sake of abstract philosophical coherence, those of us who promote the European ideal will have a hard time countering well founded public disillusionment with the EU.</P>
    <P>The effects of abolition of duty free here will be enormous and will probably effect every family in some way.  The magnitude of this decision is only dawning on the Irish public.  The Taoiseach's decision of 1991 will have a devastating effect on tourism, commerce, Aer Rianta and airline and ferry companies.  More than 2,000 workers are directly employed in the Irish duty free industry. These jobs are directly under threat with the abolition of duty free which was voted for by the current Taoiseach in 1991.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta earned £26 million in 1996 from duty free sales, representing more than half its profits for the year.  Because of the success of Aer Rianta's duty free operation we currently have one of the lowest systems of airport charges in Europe.  This will not be tenable when duty free is abolished.  It will lead to higher airport charges for airlines which will be passed on to consumers through higher ticket prices.  This could have a knock-on effect on our inflation rate.  My party colleague, Deputy McDowell, has been at pains to point out the inflationary effects of the Minister for Finance's budget carve up.  Reductions in capital gains tax, the reduction in the higher rate of income tax and the onset of EMU will lead to inflationary pressures on our economy.  Increases in transport rates for people and trade will also feed into this Government inspired spiral and could, in the long-term, put our economic success at risk.  I do not wish to appear alarmist but there is serious cause for concern at this Government's tax and fiscal policy to which Ministers seem oblivious.</P>
    <P>The abolition of duty free will severely restrict Aer Rianta's plans for investment and expansion and will place unnecessary and untimely strain on the finances of one of our most successful semi-State industries.  It is ironic that at the same time as we finally manage to put Aer Rianta on a statutory footing through the Air Transport and Navigation (Amendment) Bill, the EU is intent on cutting the ground from under them by this madcap insistence on the abolition of duty free. Given the severe cut in revenue that Aer Rianta will suffer in the coming years, I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Enterprise to re-examine their decision to pillage the coffers of Aer Rianta as part of the process of conferring on them semi-State status.  The £14 million the Department is demanding from Aer Rianta is morally wrong, but in the face of the abolition of duty free this smash and grap decision is also commercial madness.  I urge the Ministers responsible to give every consideration to reversing this daylight robbery.</P>
    <P>The impact of the 1991 ECOFIN decision will extend to all our international transport operations.  Ferry companies, airlines and our airports <Col N="1523" /> will suffer a severe loss of revenue and no doubt this loss in income will be compensated for by increased fare prices and job losses.  Many workers in the duty free sector also earn a substantial amount of their wages from commission on duty free sales and the loss of this will affect ordinary workers in a very real way.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's actions in trying to reverse the 1991 decision of her party leader. However, I cannot hope the Minister will succeed in her endeavours.  The sound of the stable doors being closed keeps ringing in my ears whenever I read reports of the Minister's offensive in Europe.  It was the Taoiseach who got us into this mess and it is he who needs to explain his decision to destroy a thriving industry with the wave of his hand.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is taking much of the heat on this issue but the Taoiseach cannot hide behind her forever and must account for his actions in 1991.  Bluff, bluster, kicking to touch and shadow boxing are no substitute for action.  I doubt, having heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, today there will be any real action.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Shortall.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  As a TD for the north side of Dublin I have a particular interest in the future of the duty free sales industry as it provides an income for hundreds of families in the north side through Aer Rianta's operation at Dublin Airport.  Workers in this area and their families face a bleak future thanks to the inaction of the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the impression being given by the Minister for Public Enterprise and latterly by the Minister for Finance that the Taoiseach achieved a major feat by supposedly delaying the abolition of the industry in 1992, he sold out the duty free industry.  The Taoiseach was in a position to veto this measure in 1992.  He chose not to use the veto and the political consequences are coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>The economic consequences of the Taoiseach's decision are far reaching.  Our ferry companies, airlines and airports are dependent on duty free revenues for much needed cashflow.  The profits from duty free sales add a considerable sum to the balance sheets of dozens of companies in the State.  For example, the contribution which duty free sales make to the economic well being of Aer Rianta is crucial to the success of that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996 more than 50 per cent of Aer Rianta's profits came from this well run and dynamic sector.  The significant loss of revenue to Aer Rianta that will result will put a serious strain on its future plans for expansion and upgrading of facilities at the three airports.  This is a successful <Col N="1524" /> Irish company which in the past has been able to sell its expertise in this area abroad.  The knock on effects of the abolition of duty free sales are stark and worrying for Aer Rianta.  This holds true for many other companies throughout the State which depend on duty free sales.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Quinn commissioned a study on the impact of the abolition of this industry on our labour market.  Given the Government's follow up, he need not have bothered because that report has yet to be published.  The Minister for Finance lamely states that is because the consultants have not yet reported.  Are we to believe that a company, obviously on substantial commission from the State, cannot complete a report, the contents of which are crucial to a campaign allegedly being conducted by the Ministers for Finance and Public Enterprise, with their European colleagues?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has not been particularly effective on the duty free sales issue but she has been hopeful. The Minister is constantly at pains to point out the initiatives she is taking with the EU Commission and the Council of Ministers regarding this issue.  She knows her chances of success are near zero.  Given that this issue gives her the opportunity to take on the mantle of Margaret Thatcher reeling against the inequities and the insanities of Europe, she has taken to it with gusto.  Despite eight months in Government and supposed activity on this issue neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister for Public Enterprise have been able to convince their British counterparts &mdash;the occupants of the European Presidency &mdash;that this is an issue worth discussing.  This is in stark contrast to the attitude of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, towards another EU project that directly affects the future development of the capital city, namely the Luas project.</P>
    <P>While the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is prepared to go to extreme lengths to have her voice heard in Europe on the issue of duty free sales she appears to become hard of hearing when the word &ldquo;Luas&rdquo; is mentioned.  There is no doubt that putting Luas underground will remove a significant incentive to use public transport.  It is an unsound idea and why the Minister is spending so much precious time and putting at risk hard won EU funding is beyond me and beyond the comprehension of the vast majority of the city's citizens.  I look forward to taking up this matter further with the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the Taoiseach is ultimately responsible for the crisis which confronts the Irish duty free industry.  It was the Taoiseach who, as Minister for Finance, decided to abolish duty free sales and to condemn thousands of families, directly involved in the industry and those who supply goods to duty free outlets, to a bleak future.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, may have put up a good show on the European stage as she attempted to convey the impression that <Col N="1525" /> she is making progress.  However, the Taoiseach cannot shirk his responsibility for this mess.  He has a duty to account for his decision at the 1992 ECOFIN meeting.  He has a duty to explain to Irish workers and Irish business the reason he decided to execute their industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as is his wont, came before the House and attempted to bamboozle us with figures.  Despite his efforts at procrastination, a key date is 1999. The Minister for Finance has asked us to consider the decision taken by the Taoiseach in 1992 in the context of time.  In so doing he effectively acknowledges that the Taoiseach could have vetoed that decision.  He introduced the spurious argument that duty free sales is a middle class issue.  This is beneath him.  He should tell that to those whose jobs will be endangered by the failure of the Government to address this issue effectively.  Duty free sales are available to those embarking not only on holidays to the Caribbean, but also to those who take cheap passenger ferry fares to the UK, noting that the single market between Ireland and the UK has been in existence for some time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is not here to explain why he took those actions.  Instead he has chosen to avoid his responsibilities in this matter.  Many Deputies have made the point this evening and on other occasions when this matter was discussed that the Taoiseach cannot hide behind the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, on this important issue.  He alone is responsible for the fate that awaits the duty free sales industry.  I know from my constituency and my colleague, Senator Seán Ryan, that the citizens hold the Taoiseach responsible and will send a message loud and clear to him and the Government in the forthcoming by-elections in Dublin North and Limerick East.  Despite attempts by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to portray the view that he is doing everything in his power &mdash;I do not know how many times he has said that &mdash; the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is doing a great deal of talking about this issue and there is much covering up for that fatal decision taken in 1992. The public, particularly the families of those dependent on the duty free industry, know where the blame lies for its execution.  When the time comes they will give their verdict on the fateful decision made by the Taoiseach in 1992.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Broughan, for the manner in which he has highlighted this issue.  The Taoiseach will not be forgotten by the people on the north side of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue not alone in my constituency but throughout the <Col N="1526" /> country.  As the Minister is aware, the turf cutting season is about to start.  Farmers and bog owners whose bogs have been included in special areas of conservation under the EU habitats directive are confused, angry and frustrated.  They are angry because they have been offered £1,000 per acre in compensation.  While this may be adequate where turf is of poor quality, the turf is inaccessible and there are drainage problems, it is unrealistic where the turf is of good quality, there is good drainage and there are good access roads constructed at great cost to their owners. This amount is an insult.  The asset value, based on the annual cost of heating a house by gas, electricity or oil, is high.  Most house owners will have to switch to an alternative fuel.  There should be a separate and much more realistic compensation package for farmers and bog owners who consistently avail of their turbary rights.</P>
      <P>Farmers and bog owners are also confused. They are to be offered alternative sites but in many cases these will be up to ten miles from their existing plot and of inferior quality.  In the first year they will be paid relocation expenses. Farmers and bog owners are frustrated because the new season is about to start and they have been unable to get their message across, even though the many groups who have met the Minister have found her to be accessible.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider providing for a one year moratorium, particularly for those who cut turf in raised bogs in the west.  It is not reasonable to expect them to accept what is on the table.</P>
      <P>The granting of SAC status interferes with the legitimate property rights of farmers and bog owners.  This has not been grasped by the Department.  I would like to know what the response of property owners in the centre of Dublin would be if somebody said that half of their nice garden would have to remain untouched.  It amounts to draconian intrusion.</P>
      <P>I have nothing but the height of praise for the officials in the Department but they do not understand the significance of this matter.  Farmers and bog owners should be allowed to cut turf in the coming season in the hope that negotiations will have been brought to a realistic conclusion by this time next year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which is causing concern.  I am well aware that it is sensitive and emotive.

      <P>When I took office it was a <i>fait accompli.</i>  I am trying to deal with it in the fairest way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1527" /> The EU habitats directive requires member states to designate their most important natural areas as special areas of conservation and protect them from anything that would damage their ecology.  It identifies all active bogs as priorities. This means they must be afforded the highest level of protection.</P>
    <P>Raised bogs are particularly important in this context.  We have proposed about 8,000 hectares of the original figure of over 300,000 hectares for SAC status.  Blanket or mountain bogs are also identified as priorities but, given that about 200,000 hectares have been proposed for SAC status, this kind of bog is less rare.</P>
    <P>While it is possible to phase out the cutting of peat in blanket bogs over a period of years, the position on raised bogs is much more critical. While it is difficult to be precise, it is estimated that 40 acres of intact raised bog are lost, effectively forever, each year cutting continues.  To meet our obligations under the directive to conserve this habitat, cutting has to stop now.</P>
    <P>My Department has had a number of meetings with those involved in turf cutting at which it was indicated that the compensation package for those who have been actively cutting in recent times and are required to stop will include the following elements: my Department will offer to buy the land from those affected and we envisage a price of around £1,000 per acre but this has been rejected by the farming organisations and others as being inadequate.  The price offered is based on my Department's long experience of buying similar land at anything from £450 to £800 per acre.  In that context the price offered is generous and relates to prevailing market prices.  For those who are not prepared to sell, we hope that in many areas we will be able to offer relocation to another bog.  Those who have to move some distance to the new alternative site will be offered a once off payment of £100 per mile up to a maximum of £500.  Where agreement is not reached, the matter can be referred to independent arbitration.</P>
    <P>While I am in favour of achieving the maximum degree of consensus, deferring the cessation of cutting for another year would not solve the problem, even if this was possible.  Many of those affected have repeatedly said that the issue is not about money but relates to a perceived infringement of traditional rights, particularly the right to use land to which they are deeply attached.  I have great sympathy for this argument but the issue must be faced now.</P>
    <P>The directive leaves me little discretion in this area but I will do everything possible to address the concerns that have been expressed.  First, my Department is prepared to purchase the turbary rights to a bog plot while leaving ownership of the fee simple with the existing owner.  This may mean a great deal to those who want to retain a tangible link with the land.</P>
    <P>Many people see the saving of turf as a family activity, and everything possible will be done to <Col N="1528" /> provide alternative sites where cutting can continue for those who want to avail of the relocation option.</P>
    <P>My Department has based its offer on the evidence of the marketplace over many years and believes that the offer is fair.  However, independent arbitration is available and if my Department's assumptions are proved wrong, this should quickly emerge as the first cases go through the arbitration process.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult for people to accept the kind of changes that are necessary to protect disappearing habitats, but the sad truth is that without change we will not be able to pass on the natural environment to our successors in anything like the state in which we received it.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department want to be seen as imposing something that people do not want, but I hope when people get used to the idea they will realise that what is being done is for everyone's benefit, and that the concerns of people who are affected will be taken seriously and addressed to the maximum extent possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  On the evening of 15 January 1997, an accident took place on the Bansha road outside Tipperary town in which the driver of one of the cars, a man from Knocklong, County Limerick, was killed and another passenger seriously injured.  There was ample evidence that the driver of the other car was intoxicated. Several witnesses had reported him driving erratically prior to the accident.  Subsequently he was charged with dangerous driving causing death.  He was also charged with drunk driving and failing to give a sample.</P>
      <P>At a court hearing in Tipperary on 2 December 1997, the lawyer for the accused asked for a special inquiry to ascertain if the accused was fit to plead.  The inquiry was fixed for 11 December 1997.  District Judge Pattwell asked the representatives of the State if an adjournment to 11 December was sufficient to have an independent examination of the accused.  The State representative confirmed that this would be so.  It transpired, however, that the examination was unable to be completed in this time.</P>
      <P>On 11 December, Dr. E.T. Neville, consultant psychiatrist, gave evidence in relation to the accused.  She stated that there was evidence of a stroke &mdash;there was a lesion of the left upper caudate, there was also cerebral atrophy and there was a moderate degree of hydrocephalous with some perienticular white matter flare indicating white matter disease.  Dr. Neville gave her opinion that brain deterioration was 25 per cent. She said it could be more specifically measured by a neuropsychologist.  She had written to Dr. McLeavy in Cork but the earliest appointment she could get was in February of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> The judge found that the brain damage was measurable.  It was not, however, examined by a person who was qualified to measure it.  At this stage the State asked for an adjournment for a full medical assessment.  Judge Pattwell stated that on 2 December the State had stated that an adjournment to 11 December was sufficient to have completed the relevant examination and he refused to adjourn the inquiry.  The judge said he could not fly against the evidence and determined that the accused was not fit to plead.</P>
    <P>The consequence of this is that there is a person at large who is deemed to have 25 per cent brain damage, is incapable of pleading, has allegedly caused the death of a person and serious injury to another, and is untouchable by the law. He is not criminally insane.  In fact there can be no finding as to his guilt or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I wish to put this anomalous situation on the public record not just because the prosecution arising from the death on 15 January 1997 cannot proceed but also because this person is free from prosecution for whatever harm he might do in the future.  The only restriction on him is that the court made an order in early January 1998 that revoked his licence for life.  However, sanctions cannot be applied if he breaches the order.</P>
    <P>The circumstances giving rise to this loss are not now amenable to court investigation or conviction.  Furthermore, the person alleged to be responsible would appear not to be answerable to the law for such actions in the future.  This case creates a dangerous precedent which not only allows those who claim brain damage immunity from charges but also creates a situation where there is no responsibility under the law for their future actions.</P>
    <P>In this case, J.P. Ryan lost his life, a wife lost her husband, a family lost their father and the community lost a great leader.  A sense of sadness and loss will continue for many years.</P>
    <P>Surely these circumstances require the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I call on the Minister to carry out a full examination of the facts and, if necessary, change the law to ensure that a similar situation will be properly addressed in the future.  The State should be in a position to apply to the court for means to protect the public which might involve some element of restraint in a suitable institution.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure Deputy Neville that this case was fully investigated by the Garda authorities. In accordance with normal procedures, a file was forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions and the director advised that a number of charges should be preferred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was duly processed and was heard at Tipperary District Court on 2 December 1997, on <Col N="1530" /> 11 December 1997 and on 3 February 1998.  The Deputy will appreciate that the courts, subject only to the Constitution and the law, are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  It is not open to the Minister, therefore, to comment on such proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister fully understands the concerns of the family in this case and, if the Deputy so wishes, the Minister will arrange for the local gardaí to meet with the family and discuss those concerns.  I hope the Deputy takes up this suggestion as it will give the family an opportunity to discuss their concerns, which the Minister understands.  Also, Deputy Neville raised some points this evening which perhaps could be clarified at such a meeting.</P>

      <P>The Celtic tiger and the economic boom are of little relevance to the people in St. Bríd's special school.  I visited the school last Friday week and met the chairperson, Marina Ryan.  I must compliment her and the staff for the wonderful work they do for these people with disabilities.  The class dealing with autistic children will be affected by the removal of the child care assistant from the school.  Who is weaker in society than these children?  Who should be helped more than these children?</P>
      <P>On 17 December 1997, the Western Care Association informed St. Bríd's that it will be unable to provide funding for this post in 1998. The resources required for the provision of special education are the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.  The Western Care Association looks after many people in various parts of County Mayo, and there is a great demand for its services.  It is not the responsibility of the Western Care Association to assist St. Bríd's special school; it is the responsibility of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a compassionate man and has some understanding.  He should not give the usual Civil Service reply tonight &mdash;that there are no resources and that this school will be the responsibility of the Western Care Association. A letter I received today from the Western Care Association stated that it will examine this matter again.  How could a charitable organisation in County Mayo say it will not assist the people with disabilities in St. Bríd's special school?  They would be run out of the county.</P>
      <P>The Western Care Association has responsibilities to its own people and this matter is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.  I call on the Minister to make the necessary resources available to retain this child care assistant.</P>
      <P>The Western Care Association does an excellent job.  In particular I want to compliment John</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> O'Dea, a director of the association in Mayo, and Liam McNally who is involved in fund raising. Their job is not to educate young people; that is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>I visited St. Bríd's special school last week I want to compliment the principal, Paul Murphy, who is not well and to whom I extend best wishes. He is a kind and caring man.  The assistant principal, Cathy Craughwell, is in charge at present and is doing an excellent job.  It is wonderful the way people look after and try to educate those children.</P>
    <P>This post involves a small amount of money. The Government collected £115 million more in revenue in December 1997 than expected.  I am not looking for £115 million for St. Bríd's special school, but for a few thousand pounds to retain a child care assistant.  The Minister should not heed the Civil Service or his officials.  He should make a decision to give the school the money it requires.  Who needs it more than these children?</P>
    <P>This is not about a tax break or buying a third house; it is about the weakest in society, children in a school who need and get special care.  What is required is for the Minister to show compassion and to sanction the allocation of a small amount of money.  I know he will not let me down and that he will grant aid this post. I am not asking to set a precedent in this regard.  This matter is the responsibility of the Department.  This school should be given a few pounds to enable it continue its good work.  Western Care Association is doing an excellent job and it will continue to raise funds because it has many people on waiting lists for its day care centres.  The Department should deal with the education side and the Western Care Association should deal with what it is good at.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to put the gun to the head of John O'Dea or the Western Care Association because it is not in a position to give money to St. Bríd's special school.  It did not give the school money in December because it did not have it.  The association say this is the Minister's responsibility.  I know he will respond positively because he is an honourable and decent politician.  I ask him to make this money available. This issue will not make the headlines, but it is important to the children concerned.  Having visited that special school I thanked God that my children were able to attend a national school. These children get special care and loving attention and I know the Minister will respond in the right way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  It was also raised by way of a parliamentary question this afternoon to which I replied.  I would not underestimate the Deputy's capacity to secure headlines in respect of any issue and I am not sure this will not make them if the Deputy's track record is anything to go by.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" /> The area of special education has exercised my attention since I came to office.  The historic evolution of that service depended largely on significant voluntary work, fund raising and the involvement of service providers, be they various religious orders, parents associations and so on, as well as State input from the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children. That is how the system evolved and what we are dealing with today.  We have a good deal of work to do to improve the position in the area of special education throughout the country by ensuring an adequate supply of teachers and child care assistants, and we are making progress in that regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding the allocation of child care posts, the bulk of those allocations came under the previous Government's jurisdiction, particularly the allocation of posts for the school year 1997-8.  My opportunity to ensure a significant improvement in this area arises with the allocation of the demographic dividend in respect of the 1998-9 school year.  That is well understood in education circles and Deputy Ring will be aware of that.  He probably made representations to the previous Government on this issue, but matters did not materialise in accordance with his priority.</P>
    <P>I have been advised that, following representations made by officials of the Department of Health and Children to the Western Care Association, the association agreed to review its decision to withdraw funding for the post of child care assistant in St. Bríd's special school from now until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>St. Bríd's special school caters for children with a moderate, severe or profound mental handicap. At present, the school has 25 children in moderate classes, and ten pupils in two classes for severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children.  My Department has sanctioned seven teacher posts, including the principal and three posts of child care assistants for this school.  One of those teachers caters for the needs of a number of pupils who, in addition to their moderate mental handicap, are autistic.  I understand the Western Care Association funded the post of child care assistant in this class but recently informed the school that funding for this child care assistant will be withdrawn in 1998.  The school has applied to my Department for an additional child care assistant post.  At present, my Department has sanction for 280 posts of child care assistant.  All of these posts have been allocated.  As a result, my Department is not in a position to allocate child care assistant posts to any school, including St. Bríd's special school for the remainder of the l997-8 school year.  My capacity to allocate child care assistant posts in any year is entirely dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.</P>
    <P>Where such posts become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years such posts have generally been allocated to cater for the needs of children with a severe or profound mental handicap.  I note in <Col N="1533" /> this context that St. Bríd's school has two such posts.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible. The issue of child care assistant support, particularly the case of St. Bríd's special school, will be considered as part of this review.  In the interim, I am pleased the Western Care Association, under the circumstances, agreed to reconsider its decision.  I wish to extend my thanks to it for that decision.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be interested to know that in the 1995-6 school year a pilot programme of special education services was established for children with autism.  Under that programme a number of special classes dedicated specifically to the needs of these children were established.  The programme involves the allocation of extra teachers to specifically address the educational needs of children with autism, the delivery of specially tailored education programmes to meet the needs of these children and the delivery of special in-service support to the teachers concerned.  My Department's inspectorate commenced a review of the operations of that pilot programme.  The review, which is expected to be completed by the end of the current school year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to raise this crucial issue with the Minister for Education and Science.  Due to an industrial dispute over staffing levels industrial action, including an overtime ban, is currently ongoing in the Department of Education and Science.  The staff engaged in that industrial action have a legitimate grievance over staffing levels.</P>
      <P>According to an article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, a confidential report prepared by the Department of Finance supports the trade union's contention that the staffing levels in the examination section in the Athlone office are inadequate to deal with the current workload. Figures quoted in that report are shocking for parents, students and anyone interested in the Irish education system.  A comparison with staffing levels in the Scottish examination branch reveals that approximately 70 fewer staff are employed by our education branch.  That is appalling for a nation so proud of its educational achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there needs to be a debate on the approach to examinations in our education system, it is imperative the Minister ensures the system, as it currently operates, is effective, efficient and meets the needs of students.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, has singularly failed to do that. There is now a danger there will be severe disruption and potential chaos when students are due to begin the practical elements of the junior and <Col N="1534" /> leaving certificate examinations in examinations in less than six weeks' time.  The extent of the disruption is likely to be massive and to affect the leaving certificate oral examinations, practical examinations in the junior certificate, home economics and musical practicals in junior and leaving certificates.  I am also informed that teachers who work annually as examiners in oral and practical examinations have not received any notification of when or where they are due to oversee those examinations.  That position pertains with a mere six weeks to the start of the examination.</P>
    <P>Another result of the overtime ban in Athlone is that teachers who were made permanent under the terms of the PCW have to date not been officially informed of their appointment by the Department.  That leaves many of our teachers in a particularly invidious position regarding their contract of employment which has serious practical import, particularly when teachers approach lending institutions for mortgages and other such loans.  We are faced with the disgraceful position that students who, in some cases, have studied subjects for five or six years may see their work come to naught due to the failure of the Minister and the Government to address the serious staffing shortages in the examinations branch.</P>
    <P>Oral and practical examinations form an essential part of some of the most progressive and dynamic parts of our secondary school curriculum.  The educationalists and business people whom I know agree on the importance of ensuring that European languages are taught at secondary school level and that every student should be given the opportunity to leave our secondary schools with an effective degree of proficiency in at least one continental language.  This is a vital component of our education system and benefits our young people culturally and economically.  It ensures that our children can fully participate as EU citizens and appreciate and contribute to our common European heritage.  It also gives young people access to European labour markets and enables them to compete in an increasingly globalised economy, whether they work in Ireland or abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to support this nation's students as they face the most important examinations of their lives.  However, it seems that to date he has been prepared to allow an industrial relations dispute to continue to crisis point, regardless of the effects on the preparations of students.  I remind the Minister of the pledge in the Fianna Fáil manifesto: &ldquo;We will provide the support necessary to implement a balanced curriculum.  Fianna Fáil is committed to that.&rdquo; However, with this ongoing imbroglio in the examinations branch it appears that this commitment along with many other promises from Fianna Fáil in its desire to return to Government have been quickly set aside once they attained office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> I urge the Minister to take immediate and effective action to resolve this dispute so that students can prepare for the examinations without this cloud hanging over their heads.  To fail to do so would be a disgrace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take exception to the tone of the contribution from the Labour Party spokes-person, Deputy O'Shea.  It is rich of the Labour Party to lecture me and the Government given that it presided over this issue for the last three years and did precious little to resolve it.  The industrial relations difficulty is something we have inherited and we are endeavouring to resolve it in accordance with the normal industrial relations mechanisms.  Having been in Government the Deputy will be aware of those mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The leaving certificate oral examinations in Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian are scheduled for the period 23 March to 3 April. Practical examinations in leaving and junior certificate music and junior certificate home economics are scheduled for the same period.  The organisation of these examinations involves a number of processes, including the appointment of examiners, arranging marking conferences and providing examiners with material to enable them to conduct the tests.  Industrial action has been undertaken by members of the Public Service Executive Union in my Department.  The action involves members refusing to carry out work <Col N="1536" /> relating to the implementation of the agreement with the teachers' unions under the PCW.</P>
    <P>The PSEU is also refusing to carry out work relating to vacant posts and to co-operate with any new work or scheme which they deem to require additional resources.  Overtime working is also affected by the industrial action.  This is an essential element in the administration and organisation of the certificate examinations due to the seasonal nature of the workload in the examinations branch.</P>
    <P>While industrial action by members of the PSEU in the form of an overtime ban has impacted on the preparatory processes staff are working as normal during the day.  In addition, the Department has redeployed staff within the examinations branch and it has been possible to continue to advance the work concerned.  I can confirm that examiners have been appointed for the leaving certificate oral examinations and it is anticipated that examiners will be appointed for the practical examination in music and home economics over the next week.  Work is also continuing as planned on the arrangements for the marking conferences which are due to take place between 2 and 12 March.  I assure the House I am conscious of the need to resolve the industrial relations problems and hope a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 11 February 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The area covered by the Rialto Community Policing Forum within the south inner city includes Rialto and Dolphin's Barn and incorporates Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House, Marrowbone Lane and Maryland.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that this area has been targeted as priority under Operation Dóchas and as a consequence has benefited from a high level of Garda attention.  Apart from the visible Dóchas uniform presence there has been intense activity by local plain clothes drug units. More recently the area was successfully targeted under Operation Cleanstreet.</P>
      <P>The Garda advise me that considerable efforts are being made by local gardaí to enhance relationships with local communities.  This entails meetings with groups such as the Rialto Community Policing Forum which consists of representatives from the community, the Canal Communities Local Drugs Task Force, and local political representatives.  I am advised that the forum have regular meetings with the Garda Síochána where issues of concern are addressed in a structured way.</P>
      <P>The forum raised their concerns with me, as the Deputy knows, on my recent visit to Rialto, about serious drug related problems.  These problems extend across two local drugs task force areas, namely, the canal communities and the south inner city.  I understand that the two task forces and the Rialto Community Policing Forum are examining the development of a new model of community policing for this wider geographical area and are proposing to set up a public seminar to ascertain the views of all interested parties. Further community policing decisions will be taken in the light of the forum's conclusions.</P>
      <P>The Garda have my full support in tackling the areas' problems and, as I indicated in my meeting with the Rialto Community, my departmental officials will be available to assist as required.  My officials have been in touch already with the local drugs task force representatives and the co-ordinator of the Rialto Community Policing Forum with a view to identifying how best to move matters forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate the concerns which have been expressed about difficulties in the areas mentioned.  These concerns were, as I have said, expressed to me directly when I visited the area. <Col N="1538" /> The problems are very real and very pressing and I can assure the Deputy that I will take every action open to me to assist in addressing them. One of the very positive messages which came across, at my meeting in Rialto, was that there are many public-spirited people in the local community, who are anxious that the problem be addressed and who are willing to help in any way they can.  Local community support and goodwill are essential if the problem of drugs is to be addressed in an effective way.  The support and goodwill is there.  I believe that it should be recognised and fostered and I will play my part in seeing that it is.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos, 30, 36, 61, 100, 104, 110 and 113 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of rapes reported to the Garda increased from 143 in 1993 to 180 in 1996.  While official Garda statistics have not yet been published for 1997, I understand the provisional figures show there has been a significant increase in the number of reported rapes as compared to 1996.  I am very concerned about the apparent trend.  However, there are a number of developments in this area which will be of particular interest to the House and they are as follows.</P>
    <P>Late last year, the Commissioner directed that the Garda Research Unit should conduct research into the incidence of rape from 1994 to 1997.  This research is now under way.  I welcome the Commissioner's decision and I look forward to seeing the findings of the research.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, the Government has established a national steering committee on violence against women which is chaired by Deputy Mary Wallace, Minister of State at my Department.  All relevant Government Departments, together with the Garda and voluntary groups, have a vital role to play on this committee.  The decision to establish the national steering committee is in accordance with one of the central recommendations of the recent report of the Task Force on Violence Against Women.  I would expect this committee to address urgently the implications of the increase in the number of reported cases of rape in recent years.</P>
    <P>My Department is also preparing a discussion paper on sexual offences.  The document is nearing finalisation and I expect to be in a position to publish it shortly.  It represents an important stage in the process of evaluating the need for further reform of the law on sexual offences.  The law with regard to rape will, of course, be covered in the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>There is also a research project being jointly undertaken by the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and Trinity College Dublin under the EU Grotius Programme.  This project is reviewing the legal process as it affects victims of rape in all EU member states.  Such an examination will allow us to identify and draw upon the best practice as it is applied in the various jurisdictions.  Officials of my Department recently met with the researchers to assist them in their work.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department is currently in the process of identifying its priority topics for research for which a provision of £250,000 has been made in my Department's Estimates allocation for 1998.  There is a range of topics in the crime area which call out for research and the incidence of rape is certainly one of them.</P>
    <P>Finally, the National Crime Forum which convenes on 26 February will provide a unique opportunity to the public, and their representative bodies, to make a tangible contribution to crime policy.  The agenda for the forum is currently taking shape and I understand that a debate on the entire issue of violence against <Col N="1540" /> women, including rape, will form a major part of the forum's work.</P>
    <P>The report of the forum will be taken into account in deciding on the form and composition of a permanent National Crime Council to be set up later in the year.  It will also feed into the White Paper on Crime which I intend to publish before the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>I have no power to order the release of Garda investigation files.  I fully understand the reluctance to release the files because of the fear that subsequent actions or investigations could be prejudiced, and that the chances of a prosecution, even at this late stage, could be compromised as a result.  Another very good reason for not releasing criminal investigation files is that many of them will inevitably contain information about suspects.  It would not only be wrong in principle to expose the names of persons who have not been convicted &mdash;they are suspects but no more than that &mdash;it could be dangerous to do so in certain cases.</P>
      <P>At a meeting which I had with the relatives on 8 October 1997, I said I would genuinely try to produce a response which the relatives would find helpful.  I am conscious there is a pending Supreme Court appeal by them against a decision of the High Court to refuse them access to the papers.</P>
      <P>I am still examining the sitution to see if a way can be found to meet the concerns of the relatives in this distressing case and I want to assure the Deputy that I will be reverting to them the moment I have arrived at my decision.</P>

      <P>I refer the House to my reply to Question No. 146 of 27 November last.</P>
      <P>The Bail Act, 1997 was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May of last year.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act is to come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Act have not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  I am sure that all Members of the House would agree that we need to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.</P>
      <P>I will bring the provisions of the Bail Act into force as quickly as possible.  I am keeping the matter under review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield.</P>

      <Quest>if he will implement the recommendations of the 1990 Martin report regarding the audio and video recordings of interviews of suspects in Garda stations; if he will provide details of the results of the pilot scheme on this matter which began two years ago in four Garda stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pilot trials on the use of audio and audio visual recording of interviews with suspects are ongoing at four selected Garda station &mdash;the Bridewells in Dublin, Cork and Tallaght and Portlaoise stations.  These trials are being overseen by a steering committee under the chairmanship of Circuit Court Judge Esmond Smyth whose task it is to assess them and report to me on whether an effective and economic basis can be found for a national scheme.</P>
      <P>Up until early February last year the pilot trials had been in operation at these stations on a non-statutory voluntary basis.  However, on average, only 8 per cent of suspects agreed to have their interviews recorded.  The steering committee advised that they would be unable to reach definitive conclusions on the effects of electronic recording on the basis of such a low percentage take-up.  They, accordingly, recommended that regulations be made under section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, making it mandatory that interviews on the pilot trial stations be recorded, subject to the gardaí having a discretion to discontinue electronic recording where a suspect objected to continued recording.</P>
      <P>Arising from this recommendation, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 were made on 11 February 1997, copies of which are available in the Library.  These regulations provide for the electronic recording of interviews with suspects detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 and section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, in the four Garda stations participating in the pilot scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With these regulations in place, the committee expect that the pilot scheme will begin to produce the data on which a proper evaluation can be based.  In this regard, the services of a research consultant have been engaged for the purpose of carrying out the necessary statistical analysis of the data emanating from each of the pilot scheme stations.  The need for a change to mandatory recording means, however, that the outcome of <Col N="1544" /> the trials will not be available as soon as originally anticipated.</P>
    <P>However, once the pilot scheme has been evaluated and the steering committee submits its report to me, the Deputy can be assured that there will be no delay on my part in moving to the introduction of a national scheme if the pilot scheme shows that an effective and economic basis can be found for so doing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 49, 55 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The answer to the Deputies' questions is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A person seeks refugee status due to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  The particular academic qualifications or skill levels of an asylum seeker do not have a bearing on a determination in any individual case although, as part of the interview process to determine if a person is entitled to recognition as a refugee it is usual to inquire about educational attainments.</P>
      <P>An examination of each individual file would be required to carry out an assessment of the kind suggested by the Deputies.  I do not have available staff resources to conduct such an examination and as the great majority of the 4,000 persons who have applied in the last 12 months have not been interviewed in depth, any outcome of such an examination would be of little relevance.</P>

      <P>It would be wholly desirable that unsentenced persons should be accommodated separately from the main population of sentenced prisoners.  In this jurisdiction, however, it is not possible to adhere to this principle as fully as we would wish because of serious overcrowding in our prison system particularly in the committal prisons.  Accordingly, a small percentage of prisoners who are remanded in custody by the courts, are not accommodated separately but they are, in all other respects, treated in accordance with their remand status.</P>
      <P>Construction of a new remand prison, on the site adjoining Wheatfield Place of Detention, is well advanced.  This purpose-designed, modern facility, which will accommodate 400 prisoners, is due for completion by the end of this year.  When completed, it is envisaged that all male remand prisoners committed from the Dublin-Leinster area will be accommodated there.</P>
      <P>Where female remand prisoners are concerned, the new women's prison, now under construction at Crowley Place beside Mountjoy Prison, will provide for the separation of remand and sentenced prisoners.  This facility will be completed and ready for occupation within the next year or so.</P>

For example, sentences of penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour have already been abolished and replaced with sentences of imprisonment as recommended by the commission.  Other recommendations remain <Col N="1548" /> under consideration in my Department and any proposals which emerge will be announced in the usual way.  I should point out, however, that the report specifically recommends against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.  It is also the case that the report pointed up a number of differences of opinion among the members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report, which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 60, 69, 98, 99 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues in Government I am concerned at the increase in the number of women who are victims of violence as evidenced by the members who have to avail of the services of refuge accommodation or indeed their crisis helplines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women which was recently established under my Department's aegis and chaired by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will look at a number of issues in relation to the problem of violence against women.  These will include an analysis of the services available to women who are victims of this crime in each of the <Col N="1550" /> regional areas.  The committee will also seek, through the regional structures, to try to ensure a cohesive response to the problem, and advise on the distribution of resources in these areas to ensure maximum value for money.</P>
    <P>The civil aspects of the law in relation to the protection of persons from violence in the home were the subject of major reform in the Domestic Violence Act, 1996 which came into effect as recently as 27 March 1996.  The Act extended the availability of the barring order remedy which had previously been confined to cases of interspousal conflict to cases of conflict between certain persons who have lived together as husband and wife, and to parents against adult children.  The Act also introduced a new type safety order remedy which can be availed of in cases of conflict between all household members, subject to conditions.  Health boards were also given powers to apply to the courts on behalf of victims who, through fear or trauma, were unable to apply on their own behalf.  The Act took into account recommendations made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women, the Kilkenny incest investigation team, the Law Reform Commission in its report on child sexual abuse, as well as a variety of voluntary organisations operating in the field.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Divorce Act, 1996, extended further the classes of persons covered to include ex spouses whose divorce decree was granted by the Irish courts or whose divorce decree is entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
    <P>Women's Aid is to receive £10,000 from my Department to monitor the effectiveness of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996.</P>
    <P>The criminal law dealing with the problem of assaults has only recently been updated and restated in modern statutory terms by the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>This Act, amongst other things, restates the law relating to various forms of assault, threats to kill or cause serious harm.  The Act provides for a range of penalties to reflect the seriousness of the various types of assault and penalties of up to life imprisonment are possible in relation to the most serious offences.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of initiatives have been taken to deal with the problem of unauthorised taking of vehicles.  These include the use of a vehicle-stopping device, known as stinger, on a number of occasions in locations where the safety of the general public has not been endangered.  In addition, high visibility patrols using four-wheel-drive vehicles are in operation and regular checkpoints are also carried out.  I am informed also that the Garda air support unit has been used successfully on a number of occasions in deterring and apprehending offenders.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities keep the situation under review and are ready to introduce any new measures which show promise.  As part of this, visits to inspect equipment, and assess measures taken on the ground in other jurisdictions, are undertaken where necessary as part of the ongoing research activities of the Garda National Traffic Policy Bureau based in Garda Headquarters.</P>

      <P>A whole-time refugee applications commissioner would finalise, on average, about six cases per day, 1,200 cases per annum.

International experience is that between 8 per cent and 10 per cent of applicants are recognised as refugees.  Even assuming for this country a recognition rate at first instance as high as 25 per cent, it can be expected that most negative recommendations of a commissioner would be appealed.  Most of those appellants will seek an oral hearing.  If one assumes that the commissioner bottleneck is removed, this would run to an estimated 3,000 appeals in a year: a workload for the Refugee Appeal Board of 15 hearings per working day.  Assuming that each hearing took at minimum one hour, the daily average throughput for a full-time board could be no more than four or five appeals.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the implementation of the Act as it stands would not improve matters from the point of view of applicants or the State.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, I received Government approval last year for an additional 72 staff to be recruited to work on asylum related duties in my Department.  I am happy to be able to advise the Deputies that the industrial relations difficulties which were holding up the recruitment of this staff have now been resolved. Steps are under way to put this additional cohort of staff in place as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The priority, as I see it, is to clear the backlog and provide a mechanism for speedy decisions. The new arrangements for processing claims which were introduced on 10 December last, following extensive consultations with the UNHCR, will, I am satisfied, bring about an improvement in the position, not just in fairness to those who have applied for refugee status who are entitled to a speedy decision but also to the taxpayer who must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.  These new arrangements are an interim measure for processing applications for refugee status and provide for an appeal to an independent person &mdash;a barrister or solicitor of 10 years' standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to review the Refugee Act, 1996 on an ongoing basis to establish at what point it might be possible to bring the remainder of the Act into <Col N="1553" /> operation or whether amendment might be necessary.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group has been considering a range of matters relevant to the issue of asylum seekers and the problem of illegal immigration.  The committee is finalising its report and I expect to be able to bring it before Government shortly.</P>
    <P>In so far as the issue of the legal challenge to the filling of the post of refugee applications commissioner is concerned, I understand that the Chief State Solicitor is in the process of drawing up the defence following consultations with the relevant Government Departments.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General has referred two matters in relation to compensation in personal injury cases to the Law Reform Commission for examination and recommendation, the law in relation to exemplary or aggravated damages, in general, and in the context of fatal injury cases; and the law which requires the court, in making awards in personal injury cases, to disregard payments under contracts of insurance or statutory schemes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that the Commission has previously made recommendations in relation the the Statute of Limitations (Report on Claims in Respect of Personal Injuries (LRC 21-1987)) and on Periodic Payments and Structured Settlements (Report on Personal Injuries (LRC 54-1996)).  The Statute of Limitation (Amendment) Act, 1991, gave effect to the 1987 report's recommendations.  Any decision made by the Government on the 1996 report's recommendations will be announced in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention also of the Deputy to the reply of the Minister for Finance to Question No. 60 of 28 January 1998 in which he indicated that the Government has decided that a State claims agency should be established to manage claims for compensation in respect of accidental personal injury and property damage which are made against the State and that a Bill to establish the agency is at an advanced stage of being drafted.  Furthermore, the Minister with responsibility for technology and commerce, has asked the special working group, established on foot of a consultancy report on the evaluation of insurance costs, to continue its work on the alternative methods of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>

      <P>The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 provides for the detention for up to seven days of persons suspected of drug trafficking offences.  As the legislation stands periods of detention in excess of the first 48 hours can only be authorised by a judge of the Circuit Court, the President of the District Court or a judge of the District Court nominated by the President of the District Court for the purposes of the Act.

    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> In recognition of the need to provide a more effective and efficient service, a local office to serve the Dublin 24 area and surrounding areas was opened at West Park, Tallaght, in 1996.  It is staffed by a senior probation and welfare officer, four probation and welfare officers, one clerical officer and one sessional supervisor.  The service is involved in the supervision of offenders in the area and the preparation of reports for the courts. It also operates the community service order scheme.  The service continues to develop very good working relationships with local statutory and voluntary organisations.  The Weat Tallaght Probation Project &mdash;&ldquo;Deonach&rdquo;&mdash;is a good example of working together in the community.</P>
    <P>The number of persons on community service orders made by the courts in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, in the last three years are as follows: 1995, 51 persons; 1996, 37 persons; 1997, 45 persons.</P>
    <P>Persons ordered to do the work are assigned to a variety of projects in the area and surrounding areas.  Service personnel endeavour to match individual skills and abilities to the available projects. The following projects were undertaken over the three year period 1995 to 1997: Scoil Carmel, Firhouse, painting; St. Joseph's special school, Tallaght, painting; St. Maelruans graveyard, clearing and tidying; Tallaght Welfare Society, painting building, clearing garden and constructing patio; Old Bawn primary school, painting; Ballyroan school, painting.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the county council and residents associations participants painted estate walls in Jobstown and Killinarden to cover graffiti.</P>
    <P>In addition, the following work is ongoing outside the area: Mount Jerome Cemetery, clearing and maintenance; Harold's Cross school, painting and cleaning.</P>
    <P>The weekly cost of operating the community service order scheme is approximately £37 per order.</P>
    <P>The 1997 budget for the entire Probation and Welfare Service was £12.5 million of which £3.8 million is in respect of grants to organisations and probation projects.  The running costs and the cost of the community service order scheme are not apportioned to local offices.  The following grants were paid to the West Tallaght Probation Project over the last three years to cover the running costs associated with the project and the cost of capital equipment: 1995, £81,763; 1996, £129,420; and 1997, £104,031.</P>
    <P>The project has been advised of an allocation for 1998 of £105,060 towards running costs in 1998.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following on the success of Operation Freeflow III, a revised operational traffic control plan for the greater Dublin area, entitled Operation Clearway, is being implemented.  This plan, which is being implemented within existing Garda resources, includes the policing of 16 key routes and traffic congestion blackspots in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  Motorcyclists from the Garda traffic unit, together with motorcyclists and foot patrols from the respective Garda divisions, are being utilised in the operation which will cover the period up to December 1998.  All members of the force are required, of course, to enforce the road traffic laws as part of their general duties, quite apart from the implementation of any special campaigns.</P>
      <P>The continuing campaign in Dublin will be reinforced by changes at chief superintendent level to ensure it has the necessary top level focus and direction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 291 together.</P>
      <P>This is an issue that arises from time to time but it has never been favoured.  The view has been taken that the Garda Síochána should continue to remain accountable to Dáil Éireann and the Government directly through the Justice Minister rather than some intermediate body. Furthermore, there has been no evidence that an independent authority would enhance the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware an extensive review of the stucture and operational capacity of the Garda Síochána was carried out recently by a steering group as part of the SMI process.  The group made a range of recommendations and they did not include the establishment of an independent authority.  I believe this speaks for itself. My overall concern is to ensure that we have an effective police force which is fully accountable to the democratic institutions of the State and I am satisfied that a police authority is not necessary to ensure that.</P>

      <P>My Department monitors the position of women on State boards on an ongoing basis.  At end December 1997, according to the analysis in my Department, women constituted 28 per cent of total membership of State boards and 35 per cent of Ministerial-Government nominees. Women comprised 23 per cent of Chairs of such boards.  These figures are very similar to the findings of the National Women's Council of Ireland's report, which covers the situation at June to September 1997.</P>
      <P>I intend to continue the policy objective of gender balance on State boards, with a minimum target of 40 per cent of women and men in direct appointments.  I will also continue to encourage nominating bodies to adopt a similar policy.</P>

However, at any one time, the percentage of the prison population in custody for non-payment of fines is approximately 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>The imposition of a fine as a penalty in any particular case is, of course, a matter for the courts and it is, I think, worth mentioning that there is an obligation on the courts when imposing a fine to take into account, where possible, the means of the offender.</P>

      <P>As I have said before I believe that the most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted offenders is a combination of appropriate treatment, education and rehabilitation.  To this end there are specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in place in all of our prisons.  The majority of offenders with drugs problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area and in particular in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> A detoxification programme has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison's health care unit for some time.  This programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes such as methadone.  The programme is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.</P>
    <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prisons system, is co-ordinated by the director of prison medical services.  The director liaises regularly with the health boards in order to try to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners which is equivalent to that available in the community.  Developments in medical services for drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.  In this regard I am pleased to note that there has been an ongoing high degree of co-operation between the Eastern Health Board, including the agencies under its aegis, and my Department.</P>
    <P>I hope that this co-operation between the prisons and the Eastern Health Board, in the interest of tackling this community-wide problem, will continue and, where feasible, expand.  In this regard the Eastern Health Board's consultant psychiatrists with responsibility for drug misuse who provide sessions in Mountjoy have been in discussion with officials of my Department, including the director of prison medical services, and the Governor of Mountjoy Prison, with a view to extending and improving the drug treatment services provided to prisoners including, where appropriate, methadone maintenance. Similar developments are envisaged in relation to tackling the drug problem in other prisons where the need is established.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware my responsibility with regard to violent children is, in the main, directed towards children who are in trouble with the law or at serious risk of being so.  I do not have primary responsibility generally, for assisting families who have violent children. The Garda Síochána through the community policing initiative, the juvenile liaison scheme, juvenile diversion projects and the Garda schools programme try to lead such children away from wrong doing.  These programmes will often require the interest and co-operation of families and indeed the general community and the Garda Síochána actively encourage this.</P>
      <P>The juvenile liaison scheme is an extra-statutory scheme operated by the gardai to divert juveniles away from the judicial system, where possible.  It provides for the cautioning and supervision of young offenders of 18 years or under as an alternative to prosecution.  Under the juvenile liaison scheme an attempt is made to see why the juvenile in question has offended and where a problem is identified the juvenile liaison officer (JLO) refers the family to the appropriate statutory or voluntary organisation with expertise in the matter.  The JLO will deal with the offender as an individual, a member of a family and a member of the community.  Even where the actions of a child do not amount to a criminal offence parents-guardians regularly seek support and guidance from the Garda Síochána who will activate the scheme for the benefit of such children.</P>
      <P>The juvenile diversion projects funded by my Department are targeted at specific large high density urban areas where there is a combination of a large young population, high unemployment and a lack of basic amenities.  The projects have a very particular focus being directed at young people who are either involved in or seen to be at risk of getting involved in crime.  The projects are also used to target juveniles who are likely to drop out of the education system prematurely or are in need of emotional and developmental support due to family circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda schools programme is specifically designed for fifth class primary school pupils and involves a series of presentations by gardaí aimed at teaching children sensible and responsible patterns of behaviour.  The intention of these various measures is that the &ldquo;caution&rdquo; rather than prosecution <Col N="1570" /> option is pursued to the fullest extent possible by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>The board of inquiry established in January, 1996 by the Maltese Ministry of Transport and Ports to investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the aircraft has almost completed its deliberations.  Following two visits to Tunisia in 1997, during which members of the board of inquiry listened to tape recordings of messages between the aircraft and air traffic control at Djerba, the Tunisian authorities requested that a copy of the recording be furnished to the board of inquiry and that the original be sent for scientific analaysis in a specialised laboratory in a third country.

      <P>More opportunities exist now than ever before for young Irish people over 18 years of age to travel and work abroad for a while and an <Col N="1575" /> increasing number of them are doing so.  There are Government-sponsored exchange programmes with the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand under which our young people may experience the culture and ways of life of those countries.  Thirteen thousand young Irish people worked in those countries for periods of from four to 12 months in 1997.  Many others independently got summer work or longer-term employment or went to study in other countries, particularly in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Irish people under 18 are still going abroad, especially to Britain, in search of employment.  The relevant statutory and voluntary organisations discourage from leaving Ireland people who are not sufficiently well prepared or equipped for living or working abroad.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Emigrant Advice Information and Counselling Service make available leaflets which contain practical advice for people thinking of going to London or the United States.  Comprehensive and country-specific information about employment opportunities and advice about living and working abroad is made available by FÁS, the training and employment authority.</P>
      <P>In addition to the assistance available to Irish people from the official social services of the countries in which they are working, advice and assistance is available to Irish people in Britain, the United States and Australia from many local voluntary Irish organisations whose valuable work is supported by grants from the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for the consular protection and welfare of all Irish citizens when they are abroad and people experiencing difficulties of any kind can seek assistance or advice from Irish Embassies or Consulates.</P>

    <P>The US State Department report for 1997 on human rights practices in China, which was issued in Washington last month, stated that the lack of due process created a particular problem in <Col N="1576" /> relation to Chinese death penalty cases.  A 1995 law raised the number of capital offences from 26 to 65 and included financial crimes such as counterfeiting currency, passing fake negotiable notes and letters of credit and illegal &ldquo;pooling&rdquo; of funds.  In May 1996, the Chinese Supreme Court ruled that crimes resulting in death should be punished by death, regardless of extenuating circumstances.</P>
    <P>Concern at the high level of death sentences in China was conveyed to the Chinese authorities by the EU in the course of a meeting of the EU-China Human Rights dialogue which took place in Beijing last December.</P>

      <Quest>the number of executions which were carried out by the state in the Ukraine in each of the past ten years; and the number of females, if any, which were executed.</Quest>

      <P>The situation regarding executions in Ukraine is very difficult to verify.  The Council of Europe has referred recently to a total figure of 180 executions in Ukraine for the two years 1996 and 1997.  However there is no information on a gender basis.  An Amnesty International report of 1997 referred to 809 death sentences in the previous six years since independence, and 451 executions.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe is at present looking into this very serious issue.  Upon accession to the Council of Europe in November 1995 Ukraine undertook to put in place immediately a moratorium on executions and to abolish the death penalty completely within three years by ratifying Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights.  In June 1996 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe considered this issue following reports of continuing executions.  Again in January 1997 the Parliamentary Assembly examined the matter and issued a stern warning to Ukraine.  It deplored 89 executions which it believed to have taken place in the first half of 1996 and demanded that Ukraine immediately honour her accession commitments and halt any executions pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the Assembly's warning it appeared that a moratorium on executions had effectively been put in place in March 1997, although this has proved difficult to verify.  In May 1997 Ukraine signed Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, abolishing the death penalty in peacetime.  A draft Criminal Code of Ukraine which did not provide for the death penalty was submitted to Parliament in June 1997. Also submitted to Parliament in that month was a draft law on supplements and amendments to the Criminal Code of Ukraine abolishing the death penalty in peacetime.  A draft law on ratification of Protocol No. 6 to the ECHR was submitted in October 1997.  Parliament appears not to have adopted these laws and there are continuing <Col N="1577" /> reports of the death sentence being handed down.</P>
    <P>In November 1997 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe dispatched its Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights on a fact finding mission to Ukraine.  It considered the committee's report at its session on 27 January last.  In Resolution 1145 adopted on that occasion the Assembly indicted that it had received official confirmation that executions continued after January 1997 and that at least 13 executions took place.  The Assembly has strongly condemned these executions and demanded that no more executions be carried out under any circumstances whatsoever.  It has also instructed its Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights to evaluate the proof to be furnished by the Ukrainian authorities that a moratorium on executions has been established.</P>
    <P>Ireland is deeply concerned at the situation concerning the death penalty in Ukraine.  The Government will be working actively both within the Council of Europe and in contacts with the authorities of Ukraine to stress the importance of Ukraine abiding by its Council of Europe commitments concerning the death penalty and to urge it to avail of Council of Europe assistance and expertise to help it meet its commitments in this area.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office is an independent body set up under the auspices of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to co-ordinate and monitor the implementation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative strategy.  It is a matter for the steering committee of the Dublin Transportation Office to decide on its work programme within the terms of its establishment order.</P>
      <P>The examination and promoton of heavy rail services is primarily a matter for Iarnród Éireann.  I have asked the company to prepare detailed investment plans for both the mainline and suburban rail networks in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period.  I expect to receive the relevant reports in the near future.  These reports will provide the basis for determining the future rail investment programme.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has also recently decided to undertake a review and updating of the Dublin Transportation Initiative strategy and this will undoubtedly address the role of the railway in that overall strategy.  The review phase, which focuses on short-term measures is expected to be completed by end April.</P>

      <P>The Road Transport Acts, 1933 to 1986 regulate merchandise transport rather than passenger transport.  A Bill to amend and update these Acts will be introduced later this year.</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services aside from services provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance that there are a number of difficulties associated with the implementation of this legislation.  It is clear that this is a very complex matter and that there are no simple solutions.  Consultations with interested bodies revealed a consensus in favour of updating the legislative framework, but no agreement on the precise form of that legislation.  It is important that the proposals which emerge establish a fair balance between the legitimate interests of the users and providers of road passenger services. At this stage I cannot say precisely when I will be in a position to bring forward legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> I need time to consider the matter further and I will take account of the views that my Department has received from the meetings already held with the various interested bodies.  While I have no plans at present for further meetings I am always open to hearing further views from interested bodies.</P>
    <P>It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the implications of the legislation for the regulation of the bus market in Dublin.  However, Dublin's transport problems are being addressed through the implementation of the DTI strategy.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Office has recently decided to undertake a review and updating of the DTI strategy.  The review phase, which focuses on short-term measures to tackle Dublin's transport problems, is expected to be completed by end April.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the speedy introduction of quality bus corridors in Dublin as I believe that the bus services are the backbone of the existing public transport network and will remain so notwithstanding the development of other bodies of public transport.</P>
      <P>Implementation of quality bus corridors is the responsibility of Bus Átha Cliath and the local authorities and is being pursued by them with the active support of the Dublin Transportation Office.  As practical evidence of its support, the DTO has allocated a total of £8 million to QBC's from the £34 million provision for traffic management grants in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>The DTI Strategy recommended ten QBCs linking suburban areas to the city centre and an orbital QBC linking the western towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.  To date, four of the radial corridors are in operation.  I am most anxious that speedy progress is made on the implementation of the remaining corridors.</P>
      <P>In addition to the substantial DTO funding, my Department is partly financing the introduction during 1998 of a real time passenger information system on the Lucan QBC route which will provide waiting passengers with up to the minute information on the service.</P>

      <P>Thus, the change now being put in place ensures that all but a small number of farmers are unaffected.  This group of applicants received an average premium payment of £15,213 in 1996 and applying headage payments ceiling at £4,000 would result in an average combined headage-premium payment in excess of £19,000 for these applicants.</P>

      <P>Mullinahone Co-op commenced distributing the current automatic supply of eartags to farmers in early January.  As was the case of supply in 1996 and 1997, tags were supplied first to farmers in the main dairying counties in the southern part of the country.  All farmers who under the predictive system are deemed to require supplies of tags will receive tags by mid-February.  The current position regarding the distribution of eartags is as follows: Tags had been issued to farmers in the following counties by Friday 6 February 1998: Cork, Clare, Dublin, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, Tipperary, Meath, Westmeath, Wicklow, Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Laois, Louth and Offaly.</P>
      <P>Tags are due to be issued to farmers in the following counties by next Friday: Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo.</P>
      <P>As I have previously informed the Deputy, arrangements have also been in place to provide emergency supplies of tags to farmers who demonstrate an urgent need to move calves born on the holding to sale or on animal health and welfare grounds.</P>

      <P>The survey, planning, design and procurement of the building and facilities for the food and veterinary office of the EU Commission at Grange are being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  In addition, the Office of Public Works has advised my Department that planning permission has been secured and clearance to proceed to the next stage was received from the EU Commission at the end of October 1997.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the Office of Public Works that the tender documents for the construction are almost complete and that client approval of this documentation will be sought later this week.  Tender invitations will issue on receipt of such approval.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the entrance to the new EU office will be near the Teagasc main entrance on the Trim road.  Given the size and importance of the office it is desirable that access to and from the location be made as easy as possible.  In this regard, Meath County Council has informed my Department that further improvements to the existing approach roads are planned and may commence during 1998.</P>
      <P>Pending the construction of the offices at Grange, the Commission has rented offices in Blackrock, County Dublin.  Currently there are 52 Commission staff of the FVO at that location, most of whom transferred from Brussels since 1 September last.  Additional staff are expected to be appointed to the office during 1998.</P>

      <Col N="1589" /> Income tax on farming profits is collected with schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are to some extent estimated.  The figures shown in the table are the tax paid by full-time farmers together with estimated tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>The figures do not include PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguished until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1994-95, the latest available, indicates that some £78 million in tax was paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
    <P>The figures for income tax yields do not include any yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 1993 tax amnesty.  Also excluded from the calculations are tax receipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The budget ring-fenced the capital allowances on hotels, which an individual passive investor may claim, to rental income.  The new scheme for investment in quality hotel accommodation in seven counties in the north and north west of the country operates by not applying this general restriction to such hotels in the seven counties, apart from hotels in the designated seaside resorts in those counties.  The budget did not restrict the allowances available to individuals directly involved in the running of hotels or to companies, and such allowances are available in these circumstances on a general basis throughout the State.</P>
      <P>As the new arrangements have been effective only since budget day, it is too soon to assess the impact of the scheme.  Also, it should be mentioned that this special scheme is being discussed with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are approximately 4,000 farmers optionally registered for VAT and approximately 105,000 unregistered farmers.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that refunds of the order of some £20 million were made to VAT registered farmers in 1997, of which £3.5 million was at the livestock rate of 3.3 per cent, £6.1 million at the 12.5 per cent rate and the remaining £10.4 million at the 21 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>The types of farm enterprises involved are too numerous to itemize.  Examples of the enterprises involved are livestock breeding, cattle breeding, arable farming, dairy farming, chicken farming and market gardening.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total expenditure by unregistered farmers on current and capital farm inputs for 1997 was of the order of £1,781 million. Some £675 million of that sum was expended on non-zero rated farm inputs such as farm machinery, agricultural contractors and insecticides.  It should be noted that not all of the expenditure of £675 million on non-zero rated farm inputs would be allowable as deductible VAT &mdash;for example expenditure on petrol.</P>
      <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the operation of the flat-rate scheme in 1998 is estimated at £93.11 million.  The flat-rate scheme is a practical method of applying VAT to farming.  It seeks to compensate unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services without applying the normal rules regarding registration, record keeping and returns.  The tax compliance burden for participating farmers is minimal and the State is also relieved of a significant administrative burden.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the last publican's licence issued to the husband of the person in question was issued in March 1996, in respect of the 1995-96 licensing year, which ended on 30 September 1996.  No application was made for tax clearance or for a licence before the end of the 1996-97 licensing year, that is, 30 September 1997.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners advise that the tax affairs of the taxpayers in question would not preclude their receiving a licence.  Indeed, the husband of the person in question received a tax clearance certificate from the Collector-General on 15 January 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> The difficulty in the case is that the Collector of Customs and Excise may only issue licences before the end of the relevant year.  After 30 September 1997 it is not legally possible for him to issue a licence in respect of the 1996-97 year. Further, he cannot renew the licence for 1997-98 because the licence has lapsed through non-renewal in 1996-97.  Because of the importance of timely renewal, the Collector of Custom and Excise issues a reminder and the appropriate forms to each licence holder in April each year.</P>
    <P>The remedy in this case is for the taxpayer to apply to the Circuit Court to obtain a new licence. This has occurred in the past and similar applications have been successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that persons employed in the construction industry are classified for tax purposes as employees or as sub-contractors.</P>
      <P>Revenue cannot dictate the terms under which workers are engaged in any industry.  The increasing drift towards self-employment in the industry mirrors the world-wide trend towards contracting out and reflects the increased flexibility of work practices.</P>
      <P>Sub-contracting is an integral part of the construction industry.  Payments to sub-contractors come within the relevant contracts tax &mdash;RCT &mdash; system commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system.  Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an unregistered contractor, he or she is required to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>Revenue has issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a sub-contractor.  Principal contractors and sub-contractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and they are both satisfied that the contract created is a contract of self-employment. However, if it emerges as a result of an investigation that an employment, rather than a sub-contract, exists and PAYE-PRSI and levies are not being deducted, the principal becomes liable for the PAYE-PRSI and levies.</P>

    <P>Revenue have advised me that they are currently engaged in a nationwide campaign to ensure that declarations made by principal contractors <Col N="1595" /> and sub-contractors represent the true situation.  The programme is focused on detecting failure by employers to operate PAYE-PRSI and levies from employees and to make the appropriate employers' contribution to PRSI.  The campaign includes site visits and entails an examination of the declarations by reference to the particular circumstances of the person employed. Where the sub-contractor status is considered to be inconsistent with the terms of employment the principal is being asked to deduct PAYE-PRSI and levies.</P>
    <P>The campaign commenced in Dublin in November 1997 and has recently been extended to country districts.  The results at this stage from the Dublin project indicate that 74 per cent of the cases examined were correctly designated as sub-contractors, leaving 26 per cent to be re-classified as employees.  Resistence to re-classification has been met from some principals.  Each such principal can have the Revenue official's decision on re-classification reviewed internally in Revenue and has a statutory right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners.  Revenue intend to visit every principal contractor not only to ensure compliance with the PAYE-PRSI and levies system, but also to ensure an even-handed approach to its campaign.</P>
    <P>In addition to this special campaign, Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regularly conduct joint investigations in the construction industry through the joint investigation programme to ensure those engaged as employees fully comply with the tax system and to protect the employment rights of employees.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case referred to by the Deputy, the taxpayer was assessed for income tax for the year 1996-97 under self-assessment.  A return was received from the taxpayer on 5 Decemer 1997.  This return was processed in accordance with the self-assessment principles and a notice of assessment issued on 14 January 1998 based on the figures in the return.</P>
      <P>The notice showed that there was a credit of tax due to the taxpayer.  A repayment cheque issued to the taxpayer on 3 February 1998.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that when the inspector of taxes received the application on the taxpayer's behalf of a P21, a PAYE balancing statement, she wrote to him and requested him to complete a return of income for the 1996-7 tax year and forward any supporting documents.</P>
      <P>In general, requests for balancing statements are dealt with as soon as possible by districts once the facts are established regarding total income and allowances.  Where the information on file is not current, taxpayers are normally asked to complete a return of income form.  In the particular circumstances of this case, the P21 will issue shortly in advance of receipt of a return of income.</P>

      <P>I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the tax measures introduced in my recent budget will be of considerable benefit to pensioners.  I announced a substantial increase in the exemption limits for the elderly of £400 single &mdash;£800 married to £5,000 single &mdash;£10,000 married for those aged 65 to 74 and of £300 single &mdash;£600 married to £5,500 single &mdash;£11,000 married for those aged 75 and over, which will take effect in the new tax year.  I also announced that it is the intention ultimately over a number of budgets to have a single exemption limit for all those aged 65 and over.</P>
      <P>Where pensioners are taxed under the normal personal allowance tax system they will benefit from the general tax improvments introduced, that is, the increase in personal allowances of £250 single &mdash;£500 married, the widening of the band by £100 single &mdash;£200 married and the 2 per cent reduction in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the health contribution and the employment and training levy, it should be noted that the levies are charged at a rate of 2.25 per cent on a person's total income from all sources with only a few exceptions, for example, social welfare payments, the income of medical card holders.  Occupational pensions are, therefore, liable to the levies. <Col N="1597" /> However, the 1994 budget introduced a low income exemption threshold for the levies of £173 per week or £9,000 per annum which means that where a person's income is lower than the threshold they are not liable to the levies.  Prior to the 1994 budget the levies were applied to person's income irrespectiive of the amount earned.  The threshold figure of £173 per week, or £9,000 per annum, was selected on the basis that two thirds of the average industrial wage is a widely used international measure of low pay.  The measure is aimed at focusing assistance towards those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The threshold for the levies was increased in subsequent budgets and in my recent budget I announed that the threshold is being increased to £207 per week or £10,750 per annum with effect from 6 April 1998.  While the low income threshold for the levies will continue to be increased there are no plans to exempt people aged 65 and over from the levies.</P>

      <P>The objective of the Government's exchange rate and monetary policy is price stability within the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system.  Reliably low inflation is central to the Government's policy of securing the maximum sustainable economic and employment growth, <i>inter alia</i> by ensuring moderate wage developments.  Our recent inflation performance has been excellent.</P>
      <P>Within the price stability objective, the objective is that the Irish pound should trade comfortably within the ERM.  Participation in the ERM has helped to underpin the policy framework within which strong economic growth has remained consistent with low inflation over recent years.</P>
      <P>As regards the euro conversion rate of the Irish pound, I will only say what I have said before which is that the Government's intention is that Ireland joins EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy in the fullest sense of the term, and that between now and decision day we will be keeping the issue under active review.</P>

      <P>No guidelines have been drawn up in respect of <Col N="1601" /> eligibility for medical card services specifically for people whose permanent place or residence is an offshore island.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioners medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and although a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he or she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  In carrying out financial assessments for eligibility due regard is given to the higher living costs associated with living on an offshore island.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>

      <P>Recently, I approved an allocation of £742,000 to the Western Health Board region for the provision of new residential and respite and day care places in 1998 for adults and children with a mental handicap and autism.  A further £270,000 has also been allocated in 1998 to the Western Health Board region to meet identified needs in existing services.  Details of the precise services to be put in place in the Western Health Board region and the individual who will benefit from these services have been agreed by the Western Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, whose membership includes representation from the Brothers of Charity services, in line with the priority needs which have been identified for the region.</P>
      <P>Proposals for the expenditure of this additional funding, as agreed by the Regional Mental Handicap Co-ordinating Committee, have now been submitted to my Department and are currently being examined.  The proposals include additional funding for the Brothers of Charity services in both Galway and Roscommon.

      <P>The integrated transport strategy set out in the final report of <Col N="1605" /> the Dublin Transportation Initiative &mdash;DTI &mdash; provides the policy framework for future transportation planning, including traffic management, in Dublin.  The Dublin Transportation Office &mdash; DTO &mdash;has been established to co-ordinate and drive the implementation of that strategy.  In addition, a director of traffic has been appointed in Dublin Corporation to bring executive efficiency and concentration to traffic management administration in the city.</P>
      <P>A range of measures recommended in the DTI report to manage traffic demand is currently being implemented.  The overall objective is to reduce the relative attraction of commuting by car, to reduce congestion and make public transport more attractive as a mode of transport. These measures include assignment of increased road capacity to quality bus corridors and cycle tracks; traffic calming measures; the provision of environmental traffic cells; and measures to deal with parking restraint including more intensive enforcement.  The director of traffic is also undertaking a study of parking policy in Dublin with a view to aligning this fully with DTI objectives.  In addition, arrangements are being finalised in my Department for a consultancy study of road pricing and related issues with reference to the Dublin area.  In accordance with its mandate, DTO has commenced work on reviewing and updating the strategy so as to adapt the strategy to changing circumstances, to review its impetus and to identify any new initiatives required.  The need for further traffic restraint measures will be considered in the light of that review process.</P>

      <P>The erection of new mobile phone masts requires planning permission.  However, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations 1997, the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to an existing radio mast and the replacement of an existing mast by a licensed operator are, subject to certain criteria &mdash;restrictions on the size, number and type of mobile phone antenna and compliance with the licensed emission standards &mdash; exempted development.  The health implications of exposure to electromagnetic non-ionising radiation are the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children and Public Enterprise. While I have, at present, no proposals to amend the planning regulations for mobile telephony, the matter will be kept under review in the light of advice from these Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of water conservation measures is one of my Department's key strategies for ensuring an adequate supply of good quality water to all users.  A number of initiatives to give practical effect to this strategy have already been completed and others are under way.</P>
      <P>The most comprehensive study ever undertaken in this country into the operation and management of water supply systems was carried out for the Dublin region in 1995 on the initiative of my Department.  The main purpose of this study was to assess existing levels of service and water supply problems in the Dublin region and to advise on the cost-effective future development of the water supply networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study was commissioned in the belief that water conservation measures should be central to developing an investment strategy to meet the future water needs of the region.  One of the key findings of the study was that over 40 per cent of the water produced in the supply systems in the Dublin region was being lost through leakage and <Col N="1613" /> the consultants recommended that a comprehensive programme of works be undertaken to significantly reduce this level of loss.  On foot of this recommendation, a five-year programme of works was approved by my Department in April 1996, costing an estimated £32 million, with a view to saving about 22 million gallons of water per day, or about half of the water currently being lost.  Work on the project is now under way.</P>
    <P>A number of other water conservation projects have also been carried out in recent years in Galway, Waterford, Dundalk, Meath, Tramore and Westport.  In September 1996 my Department issued a circular on policy in relation to water conservation to all local authorities.  The circular included a comprehensive guidance manual prepared by consultants on ways to reduce leakage and invited local authorities to submit proposals in this area.  On foot of the proposals received by my Department, the water and sewerage services investment programme for 1998, which I announced on 2 February, includes 14 water conservation schemes at an estimated cost of £50 million, including the scheme for the Dublin region.  Details of the investment programme are available from the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I will be appointing consultants this year to undertake a national water audit to determine, among other things, for each of the larger water supplies which have not yet been the subject of a study, the need for new measures to conserve water.  My Department has also encouraged local authorities to promote water conservation in their own areas by measures such as the metering of commercial supplies, public awareness, etc.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 239, 240 and 241 together.</P>
      <P>My Department took over responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, now known as disability allowance, from the health boards on 2 October 1996.  At the time of transfer the person concerned was being paid disabled person's maintenance allowance by the health board, the rate due at transfer was £20.50 a week on the basis of her weekly means, as assessed, of £44.  Her means derived from the weekly value of the UK statutory pension.  My Department paid disability allowance of £20.50 from 2 October 1996 until 4 June 1997 when her payment was increased to £23.50 a week in line with the increases provided for in the 1997 budget.</P>
      <P>Beneficiaries of social assistance payments, including disability allowance, are required by law to report increases in their means and periodic reviews are undertaken to ensure that the correct entitlement is in payment.  It is also open to beneficiaries to request a review in order to have their payments increased in line with any reduction in their means including any reductions due to currency fluctuations.</P>
      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned was reviewed in January 1998 when it was found that her statutory pension had increased to stg£50.90. The means attributable to this pension have been assessed at IR£57 a week entitling her to a disability allowance of £11.50 a week.  Payment at the correct weekly rate £11.50 a week plus £5 a week fuel allowance has been made with effect from the review date, namely, 21 January 1998. In the event that the value of her UK pension declines due to currency fluctuations, it is open to her to apply to have her entitlement to disability allowance reviewed.</P>

      <P>In assessing income from farming for unemployment assistance purposes, up to £2,000 received by a farmer under the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash;is disregarded.

Any decision to extend the scheme would have regard to the costs of increasing the limit, the likely impact on scheme take-up by farmers and the equity implications of increasing the disparity in treatment of incomes from various sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the introduction of class A PRSI for community employment &mdash;EC &mdash;workers, which was provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1996, was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.  The Deputy will be aware that the social welfare secondary benefits of butter vouchers, free fuel allowance and the Christmas bonus, are payable only to recipients of long-term social welfare payments.  Since former CE workers who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit after their period of CE finishes are in receipt of a short-term payment, they are accordingly ineligible for the social welfare secondary benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have informed the House on several occasions that while I fully recognise the difficulties facing those former CE workers who no longer have entitlement to certain secondary benefits, the position is that I am not in a position to introduce special concessionary arrangements for such people without having equal regard to the position of other short-term social welfare payment recipients.  Any such concessions would, accordingly, carry an extremely high cost and could only be considered in light of available resources and in the light of other priorities.  It is estimated that the cost of extending the 1997 <Col N="1616" /> Christmas bonus to all unemployment benefit recipients would have amounted to some £4 million.</P>

      <P>The person concerned made an application for unemployment assistance on 7 February 1997.  Following examination of her case a deciding officer disallowed her claim on the grounds that she was not available for work due to the fact that she was a full time student. She was writing a thesis and receiving a higher education grant on the basis that she was a full-time student.  She appealed against this decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. The appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision.  An appeals officer's decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.  She made a repeat claim for unemployment assistance on 4 November 1997.  On the basis of information supplied her claim was disallowed on the grounds of non-availability for work as she was still studying full-time.  To date no appeal has been received against this decision.</P>

      <P>NHAs are only at the proposal stage and will not be formally designated until the necessary amendment to the Wild-life Act, 1976, has been passed by the Oireachtas. At that stage, those affected will be notified to the maximum extent possible.  In the meantime, given that proposed NHAs have implications for REPS entitlement &mdash; in terms of additional payments &mdash;maps of the areas affected may be inspected at the local offices of Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, the Department of Agriculture and Food &mdash;farm development offices &mdash;the relevant local authority offices and Teagasc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SACs are being established under the provision of the EU Habitats Directive.  The European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 &mdash;S.I. No. 94 of 1997 &mdash;which transposed the Directive into Irish law, provide that each <Col N="1617" /> owner and occupier of land affected by SAC proposals shall be notified of the proposal to designate the land in question.  Over 1,000 individual notifications have been issued to landowners in County Mayo.  The regulations further provide that, where the address of the owners or occupiers of affected land cannot be found after reasonable inquiry, notices and maps showing the site concerned shall be displayed in specified public places, and advertisements shall be broadcast on at least one local radio station and in at least one newspaper circulating in the area, and every such advertisement shall request any person affected to contact my Department.  The procedures outlined above were followed in all affected areas.</P>
    <P>The proposed NHAs in County Mayo were publicly advertised in the <i>Western People</i>, The <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> and the <i>Mayo News</i> on 14 December 1994.  The proposed SACs were advertised in those newspapers on 12 March 1997.  Public meetings were held in Belmullet, Crossmolina and Newport together with information sessions conducted by my Department's staff at the following locations.  Gym Centre, Killala; old vocational school, Belmullet; Healy's pub, Glenamoy; parish hall, Louisburg; Cuslough community centre, Carrowkennedy; salmon research centre, Furnace; Killeen community centre, Killadoon; parish hall, Bangor Erris; Gorman's pub, Bellacorrick; Keel hall, Achill; local hall, Ballycroy; amenity centre, Mullraney; and Teagasc office, Ballinrobe.</P>
    <P>A letter giving basic information about the SAC process, together with details of where more complete information could be obtained, was sent to some 23,000 rural households in areas in County Mayo thought likely to be affected by the SAC proposals.  Maps of proposed SACs are available for inspection at the local offices referred to above.  Any person who feels that SAC proposals may affect them should contact either the local offices of Dúchas, or its Dublin head office at (01) 6613-111 or Freephone 1-800-405-000 and further information will be provided to them.</P>

      <P>Compensation will be available for landowners who can show that they have suffered a loss as a result of any restrictions arising from SAC designation.  Where agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.

Raised bogs are very much rarer both in Ireland and in Europe.  Some 8,000 ha are being proposed for inclusion in SACs in Ireland.  The imperative to take prompt action is very much more pressing in the case of raised bogs, therefore, and, consequently, it is intended that turf cutting should now cease in these particular areas.</P>

As soon as this confirmation is received, my Department will make a formal response to the proposals.</P>

      <P>The following table contains details of allocations from the islands development fund for the years 1996 and 1997, as requested by the Deputy. None of this funding remains to be allocated.  No <Col N="1620" /> commitments have as yet been made from the £1.6 million capital allocation for island development in 1998.  I am not aware of the commitment concerning County Mayo referred to by the Deputy.  The Deputy will also be aware that the vast bulk of the allocations of money was made during the term of the last Government when this responsibility lay with the then Minister, Deputy Donal Carey acting as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach.  The present Government is committed to all the islands and has provided greatly enhanced funding for the islands this year as well as transferring responsibility for the islands to this Department giving, for the first time, a Department with a direct responsibility for island affairs.</P>

      <P>Is iad na tionscadail ar leith sa Ghaeltacht seachas Údarás na Gaeltachta a earcaíonn fostaithe dá gcuid gnóthas.  Tá sé mar pholasaí ag an Údarás, áfach, na tionscadail sin a spreagadh chun daoine le míchumas a earcú oiread agus is féidir.</P>
      <P>Tá iarrachtaí ar leith ar bun ag an Údarás i gcomhar le heagrais eile chun tionscnaimh a chur chun cinn ar mhaithe le deiseanna a chruthú do dhaoine le míchumas.  Ba thogra den chineál sin é an togra píolótach a reachtáil Bord Sláinte an Iarthuaiscirt i gcomhar le Ruibéir Mótair Teo, comhlacht a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás, chun deis a thabhairt do dhaoine le míchumas iad féin a chur in oiriúint don saol oibre agus chun taithí a thabhairt dóibh chuige sin.  D'éirigh go maith leis an togra sin agus tá spás oifige curtha ar fáil ag an Údarás anois mar ionad acmhainne agus teagmhála chun an tionscnamh a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Tograí eile gur fiú a lua sa chomhthéacs ná páirt an Údaráis i dtionscnaimh leis na Bráithre Carthanachta i gCasla, Contae na Gaillimhe, agus leis an Institiúid Athshlánaithe i gCasla freisin.</P>
      <P>Cheadaigh an tÚdarás deontas de £16,000 anuraidh mar pháirtmhaoiniú ar chlár oiliúna agus forbartha i gcomhar le Bord Sláinte an Iarthuaiscirt agus le cabhair ón gClár Horizon de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh.  Is clár dhá bhliain atá i gceist agus glacfaidh thart ar fiche duine ón nGaeltacht le míchumas páirt ann.  Cosnóidh an clár thart ar £300,000.  Táthar ag súil leis mar thoradh ar an gclár go mbeidh sé ar chumas na rannpháirtithe fostaíocht a fháil i ngnóthais oscailte, nó dul i mbun oiliúint bhreise chuige sin, nó i mbun féinfhostaíochta.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my Department provides grants to many hundreds of individuals and bodies in any single year &mdash;particularly in the context of schemes relating to the Gaeltacht, including Gaeltacht housing grants and grants to householders providing accommodation for students attending Irish summer colleges.  The detailed information sought by the Deputy would involve the examination of numerous records relating to two large counties with extensive Gaeltacht areas and would be difficult to justify in the light of the amount of official time and expense involved.  If, however, the Deputy wishes to bring to my attention any particular cases he has in mind, I will, of course, be glad to assist him.</P>

      <P>My Department has no discretionary funding available to it to provide funding for the restoration and renovation of old churches.  The main source of public funds for heritage projects is the Heritage Council, which is a statutory, autonomous body under the Heritage Act, 1995.  Under that Act, the council has powers to provide advice and assistance &mdash;including financial assistance &mdash;in relation to the protection, preservation and promotion of the physical heritage, including the architectural heritage.  The council is located in Rothe House, Kilkenny city &mdash; telephone number 056-70777 and fax.  056-70788.  It should be noted that, although my Department funds the Heritage Council, I have no function in relation to decisions by it on the disbursal of grants.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 258, 295 and 296 together.</P>
      <P>Following an inspection of Youghal courthouse by officials of my Department, Cork County Council was asked in July last year to appoint a structural engineer to prepare a report on the courthouse.  This report was received recently by the county council which sought clarification in relation to a number of aspects of the report.  The structural report and subsequent clarification was received in my Department on 3 February 1998. The report represents a full structural survey of the building and provides possible solutions to the problems highlighted in the report.</P>
      <P>Having considered the structural engineer's report my Department has supplied Cork County Council with an outline of court accommodation requirements in Youghal and has suggested a strategy to progress this project.  It is not possible to provide a timescale for the provision of modern court and court office accommodation in Youghal at present but I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to providing modern court facilities in Youghal as quickly as possible.  With regard to the future of court sittings in Youghal I understand that the District Court judge has recently adjourned sittings of the District Court to Dungarvan until further notice.  This is the decision of the judge and I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>It is an important feature of the asylum determination process for an asylum seeker to show that he or she has grounds for being recognised as a refugee and that the asylum seeker is who he or she claims to be.  It is necessary, therefore, for all asylum seekers to produce, as far as it is possible in their particular circumstances, some sort of evidence as to their identity. Not all asylum seekers flee their alleged countries of origin without some form of identifying documentation, though most of our asylum seekers are not in a position to produce identification papers. Accordingly, it is common practice to advise all asylum seekers to try to secure and provide documentary evidence of their nationality and documentary evidence to support their application for asylum.</P>
      <P>It has been my Department's policy not to inquire of countries of origin about individual asylum seekers as this would be contrary to the assurance given to asylum seekers that their cases will be dealt with in confidence.  As the situation in the country of origin of asylum seekers is a most important factor in the determination process, it is essential that such information is researched in detail.  For this purpose, my Department obtains information from, <i>inter alia</i>, the UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Amnesty International reports, the media and other EU member states.</P>

      <P>It is currently taking about two years to decide on individual cases.  The delay is due, in part, to the very large increase in applications for refugee status lodged in recent years. A further factor is that the procedures for dealing with such applications, which dated back to 1985, were adequate to deal with 30 to 60 applications a year but were totally inadequate to deal with the large increase in asylum applications over the past three years and the past 18 months in particular.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements for processing claims which were introduced on 10 December last following extensive consultations with the UNHCR will, I am satisfied, bring about an improvement in the position, not just in fairness to those who have applied for refugee status who are entitled to a speedy decision but also to the taxpayer who must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.</P>
      <P>In December 1996, a little over one year ago, there were 4.5 staff assigned full time to asylum duties.  In the same month, the Department of Finance agreed, as an interim measure, to sanction additional staff for the asylum area.  By April 1997, the number of staff dedicated to dealing with asylum applications had risen to 13.  On 28 July the Government approved, as an interim measure, the recruitment of 72 temporary staff. By 9 October additional staff were redeployed to the asylum area of my Department.  This brings to 22 the number of staff dedicated to dealing with asylum applications.  The recruitment of the balance of the staff approved in July was delayed due to industrial relations difficulties.  However, I am happy to say that these difficulties have now been resolved and procedures for the recruitment of the additional staff have commenced.</P>

      <P>An applicant for refugee status must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear exists the applicant will be granted refugee status.  Each application is individually examined and it is only after such examination is completed that a decision on its well-foundedness can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department accepts applications for refugee status from persons of many different countries of origin.  All these applications are examined <Col N="1630" /> in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention to determine if Ireland is the appropriate state to consider the applications.  Following this examination, the applications are considered in accordance with the definition of a refugee as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This section defines a refugee as someone who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.  An applicant must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear does not exist the application will be rejected and the applicant refused refugee status in the State.</P>
    <P>International experience is that there are those who intentionally misuse asylum procedures for illegal immigration purposes.  Last year I attended an international conference with almost 40 other Ministers and representatives of international institutions which examined the worldwide problem of illegal immigration.  At that conference, I was interested to hear the UNHCR representative speak on discouraging the abuse of asylum procedures.  He said that a number of migrants seeking employment, rather than protection from persecution, circumvent legal immigration regulations and request asylum.  He emphasised, and I agree with him, that attempts by people with no valid claim to international protection take advantage of asylum procedures and create serious problems by clogging those procedures. He went on to say that, moreover, such abusive claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal migrants and, in turn, reflected negatively on the asylum institution and, hence, on bona fide refugees.  The UNHCR also underlined another major concern of states and the UNHCR alike and that is the phenomenon of asylum seekers who leave countries in which they have found, or could have found, protection in order to seek asylum elsewhere.  Movements of this kind have a destabilising effect on international efforts aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees.</P>
    <P>While recognising that there is a problem with abuse of asylum procedures, as a means of facilitating illegal immigration, it is nevertheless critically important that we do not prejudge cases, that each application is fully and fairly considered and that each applicant has access to an independent appeals system.  These are the principles by which I am operating and will continue to operate.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 18 December 1997 I published the Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill, 1997.  This Bill, for the first time, defines child pornography and makes the possession of it an offence.  It also makes it an offence to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell or show child pornography.  Penalties on conviction of these offences range from a maximum fine of £5,000 and/or up to five years imprisonment for possession to a maximum fine of £100,000 and/or up to ten years imprisonment for the other offences.  Also, the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet has prioritised the issue of child pornography on the Internet. The group's first report, which will reflect this focus, is expected within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed, under the terms of Partnership 2000, to supporting the implementation of family friendly policies in the workplace.  In pursuing this aim the expertise of the Employment Equality Agency, which comes under the aegis of my Department, will be utilised.  It is my intention to enact legislation by June of this year to give effect to the terms of the EU Directive on Parental Leave.</P>
      <P>My Department is chairing the expert working group on child care which was established under Partnership 2000 in July 1997 for the purpose of devising a national framework for the development of quality child care facilities in Ireland.  The group had its inaugural meeting on 18 July 1997. There are over 70 members in the group representing parents and a range of Departments, statutory bodies, the social partners and non-governmental organisations with expertise and an interest in child care.  The expert working group aims to present its final report by the end of December 1998 and to produce an interim report in June 1998.</P>
      <P>I am also seeking to address the need for child care facilities as an equal opportunities measure through the pilot child care initiative programme. The programme, which provides capital funding for the establishment of child care facilities in disadvantaged areas, is targeted at parents who are aiming to participate in employment, training or education.  A sum of £2.615 million has been allocated in my Department's 1998 budget for the continuation of the pilot child care initiative and for the expert working group on child care as compared with an allocation of £800,000 for child care in 1997.</P>
      <P>The role of my Department in developing a child care infrastructure as an equal opportunities measure has been underpinned by EU funds.  A new measure, child care infrastructure, was inserted at the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework and a nominal 1 million ecus from the European Regional Development Fund was allocated to my Department for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Further recognition of the equal opportunities dimension of child care is contained in the employment guidelines agreed at the Luxembourg Employment Summit in December 1997, which require member states to strive to raise levels of access to child care services as an equal opportunities measure.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department already compiles statistics in respect of some of its areas of responsibility and is working towards enhancing the work already carried out by the use of information technology for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department commissioned a study by Coopers and Lybrand of the information technology needs of the Department in the context of the major organisational reforms now under way, in particular the setting up of the Courts Service and Prisons Authority and the recently announced expert group review of the Probation and Welfare Service.  This study has now been completed, its recommendations approved and additional resources have been provided in the 1998 Estimates for all Votes under my aegis.  This significant new investment further demonstrates the Government's practical commitment to new information technology systems for the justice area.  Underlying this investment is a commitment to appropriate integration of systems.</P>
      <P>Some 20 projects have been identified for completion over the next three years.  Among the major projects identified is a detailed analysis of the information flows between the various agencies in the criminal justice system under my aegis. It is expected that this project, together with the development of major case tracking systems within the courts and prisons areas and the delivery of Garda operational systems under the PULSE project, will provide detailed statistical information on occurrences and trends, enabling quantitative research and lay the foundation for the increasingly effective use of technology in the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive statistics on the prison service were included in the annual report on prisons and places of detention up to 1993.  In 1996, a decision was taken, in order to expedite the publication of the backlog of annual reports, to publish separately the statistical element from the main body of the reports.</P>
      <P>The lack of resources to provide comprehensive information technology in the prisons has inhibited the preparation of both the annual statistics and statistics of an ad hoc or once-off nature for reply to parliamentary questions, press queries etc.  This matter has now been addressed and resources have been made available this year for the replacement of the out of date and partially computerised prisoner records system.  Planning for the new system is at an advanced stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some statistics in relation to the courts are currently compiled and collated in my Department, the Working Group on a Courts Commission has highlighted an absence of adequate statistics on the courts system.  The development of comprehensive systems for collating and interpreting statistical data is being addressed as part of the planned expansion of information technology in the courts.  This development will not only assist the new Courts Service to manage court statistics, it will also <Col N="1639" /> greatly enhance relevant data for use by my Department in policy making.</P>

      <P>As I have announced previously, new accommodation has been procured for staff dealing with applicants for refugee status and this accommodation will become a one-stop-shop for asylum seekers.  I have set aside space in the new accommodation for the UNHCR and this space includes room for a research and documentation centre.

I understand that due to their complicated nature applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of the applicant's claim for registration as owner, take some time to process.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that this application is associated with a prior application which appears to conflict with some of the details supplied and the Land Registry expects to be in contact with the applicant's solicitor in the near future to rectify the situation.  I can confirm, however, that the Land Registry will do everything possible to expedite the resolution of this application.</P>

      <P>In November 1997 the Government published the strategic management initiative report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Commissioner was a member of the steering group.</P>
      <P>The report includes recommendations for change covering many aspects of policing, and the relationship between the Garda Síochána and the many State agencies comprising the criminal justice system.  I very much welcome this report.</P>
      <P>In order to implement the complex and challenging programme of change envisaged, the Government has established an implementation steering group, as recommended in the report, to develop and implement the overall programme of change.  The Garda Commissioner is a member of this steering group.  A full-time implementation team made up of senior representatives of the Garda Síochána and of my Department has also been established to work with the implementation steering group.  I am confident that the establishment of these structures will ensure the success of the change process envisaged, leading to a more efficient and effective Garda Síochána, an improved criminal justice system and greater security for citizens.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 307 and 310 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has a responsibility to ensure that all children, including those attending the school in question, have access to an appropriate education service.</P>
      <P>My Department meets this responsibility through the allocation of teaching and other support personnel and through funding allocations.</P>
      <P>In the case of St. Bríd's special school in Castlebar, my Department has sanctioned seven teacher posts.  This reflects the reduced pupil-teacher ratios applicable to the children attending the school.  In addition, my Department has allocated three child care assistant posts to the school to assist the teaching staff in meeting the needs of the children.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Western Care Association, which has been funding a further child care assistant post at the school, had indicated that it might not be in a position to continue this funding and that the post was in danger of being lost to the school.</P>
      <P>However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that following contact with the Western Care Association, it has now been established that the association will continue to fund this post pending a transfer of responsibility for the funding in question to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Western Care Association for its co-operation in this matter and for the very valuable contribution <Col N="1646" /> which it continues to make in the special needs area.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the child care area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I assure the Deputy that the needs of St. Bríd's special school will be fully considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315, 340 and 342 together.</P>
      <P>I have set up a working group to examine problems arising from the weight of school bags.  The working group is comprised of representatives of parents and teachers as well as medical professionals and representatives of the Department of Education and Science.  The first meeting of the group was held on 9 October 1997.  It is expected that the group will complete its report in the very near future.</P>
      <P>This group is addressing all aspects of the problems posed by the weight of school bags, including any possible implications for the health of pupils.  It will also formulate proposals to alleviate such problems.</P>
      <P>When I receive the report I will consider what further action will be appropriate.</P>

      <P>The leaving certificate applied has been introduced on a phased basis since September 1995.  There are approximately 5,600 leaving certificate applied places being provided in over 160 schools/centres at present.  There will be a further expansion of the number of places and centres offering the programme in the next school year. Each second level school has been invited to apply to participate for the coming school year.</P>
      <P>The leaving certificate applied is a distinct, self-contained two year programme.  By its nature and structure it demands significant resources.  For this reason staffing is allocated on the basis of 1.25 teachers per group of 20 leaving certificate applied students.  In addition an additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £125 is provided for each leaving certificate applied student.  A special capital grant for equipment is also available.  Class sizes of 20 are considered necessary so that a reasonable variety of options within the vocational specialism area can be provided by the school.</P>
      <P>A promotional campaign to inform parents, employers, teachers and the further education sector about the leaving certificate applied is currently being conducted to enhance general understanding of the value and relevance of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is prepared to consider proposals from schools to provide the leaving certificate <Col N="1651" /> applied on the basis of inter school co-operation where this is a practical option.</P>

      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy, there are only five eligible pupils from the area in question offering for transport to Glanmire community college.  I regret it would not be open to my Department to establish a special service for these pupils.</P>
      <P>However, remote area grants may be sanctioned where children are basically eligible for transport but there is no service to the school on which they could be accommodated.  These grants are shared where there is more than one family from a particular area.</P>
      <P>A remote area grant has been sanctioned in this case.  As the families in question live in the same locality, they are expected to share the grant which has been sanctioned.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the payment of higher education grants to students attending this course in previous years is that once it was brought to the attention of my Department that this course was an undergraduate course, my Department advised Dublin Corporation that it was not an approved course for the purposes of the higher education grants scheme.  As five students had been awarded grants by Dublin Corporation for the attendance at the course during 1996-97, before the matter came to light, my Department authorised the payment of the grants as an exceptional matter as the students had been advised in good faith that the course qualified for financial assistance.  The position in relation to the 1995-96 academic year is that three students were incorrectly awarded grants by Dublin Corporation and inadvertently approved by my Department on the basis that it was a postgraduate course.</P>

      <P>Existing schools are inspected at the discretion of the council and at least once within a three year period.  The Department of Education and Science grants recognition on an annual basis and a recognised school must therefore renew its application annually.</P>

      <P>The requirements governing the recognition of schools by the Department of Education and Science for the teaching of English as a foreign language are being forwarded to the Deputy. They cover: school premises; content of courses; appropriateness of courses to level and age of students; desirability of courses adequately reflecting Irish life and culture; need to include a schedule of supervised activities for students under 16; compliance with ACELS criteria for the management, staffing and organisation of the school &mdash;set out in the schedule of minimum standards; training and induction of teachers; teacher qualifications; provision of library facilities; and accommodation of students in host families.</P>
      <P>Applications for recognition must be submitted on the official application form by 30 April of the year in question.  A non-refundable fee of £130 must accompany each application.  Applications are processed by the ACELS secretariat.  They are considered at a meeting of the council, the inspection process takes place, the list is ratified at a council meeting, the list is then submitted to the Department of Education and Science and schools are notified.  Given that ten months have to elapse between the two inspections needed for the recognition of a new school, the whole process from application to sanction can take 18 months.  In the case of existing schools which seek recognition of a second or third centre, the process takes only a few months.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the guidelines, if any, which have been given to Dublin City University regarding gender balance for appointments to, or composition of, its governing body under section 16(10) of the Universities Act, 1977.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3276/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16(10) of the Universities Act, 1997, obliges each governing authority to ensure that each sex is represented on its governing authority in accordance with such gender balance as may from time to time be determined or approved by the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Recognising the primary statutory responsibility vested in the universities in relation to the composition of the individual governing authorities and cognisant of the range of circumstances pertaining in the individual universities, I chose not to specify a gender balance of any specific proportion in the context of the composition of the first governing authorities under the Act. Instead I invited the individual universities, including Dublin City University, to forward their proposals on the question of gender balance.  The composition of the governing authorities has been finalised in the case of three universities and I have approved the gender balance achieved in these three instances.  In each case there has been a significant improvement in female representation over the previous governing authority.  Furthermore, I have requested the incoming governing authorities to consider what steps are necessary to achieve a gender balance of 40 per cent in the context of the subsequent governing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to Dublin City University is that the composition of the governing authority has yet to be finalised.  In accordance with the provisions of the Universities Act, 1997, I appointed a commission for Dublin City University on 18 July 1997 to determine the composition of the governing authority for the university.  The commission duly reported to me to the effect that the governing authority would comprise 35 members, for a two year term.  The commission anticipated a gender balance of at least 30 per cent females.  As in the case of the three governing authorities which have been finalised, I will <Col N="1658" /> consider the final gender balance likely to be achieved, once known.</P>

      <P>My Department's capacity to allocate additional child care assistant posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand across the special needs area.  Where such posts do become available, they are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  In recent years, available posts have generally been targeted at special classes catering for children with severe or profound mental handicap.</P>
      <P>I am at present reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the child care area, to ensure that all available resources are utilised as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be considered in this context.</P>
