      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Last week I met representatives of the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition and the Lower Ormeau Concerned Community to discuss the issue of parades.  I also briefly met members of the Parades Commission when I dropped in to a lunch hosted by Senator Haughey.  At these meetings I took the opportunity to stress the importance of dialogue and accommodation and the Government's view that we cannot allow this year's marches to threaten the agreement that everybody has worked so hard to achieve.  The two residents' groups expressed their fears and concerns about the situation.  I hope the message being expressed clearly by people in both communities, that they do not want conflict, will be heeded by all of those involved directly.</P>
      <P>The Government and I are anxious that a situation will be brought about in which there can be a balanced, fair and agreed accommodation of the rights of the various groups involved, in the spirit of the commitments given by all the participants to the British-Irish Agreement to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust, to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all and drawing on the accepted principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem. The Government and I will do all we can to encourage an accommodation on this issue, which will receive the highest priority in the weeks ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My most recent telephone conversation with President Clinton was on Saturday 23 May as the results of the referendums on the British-Irish Agreement were coming in.  I was delighted to be <Col N="1091" /> able to convey to President Clinton the news of the decisive and overwhelming endorsement given by all the people to the agreement and to thank him for his input and that of his Administration in helping to bring about this positive chapter in Ireland's history.</P>
    <P>Last week I met Sir Kenneth Bloomfield.  I congratulated him on his report and the work he had done in the presentation of the cases of the victims of violence.  This is an important part of the healing process.  As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced recently, the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, will carry out a similar exercise for victims of the violence from a southern perspective.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to change the present arrangements with regard to Northern Ireland affairs.  As I said in response to Questions recently, the implementation of the State's commitments arising from the British-Irish Agreement will be closely overseen by the Government, particularly the members most closely concerned, that is, me, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the meeting with the Garvaghy Road Residents' Association, did the Taoiseach receive representations to the effect that it would be useful if public representatives elected by the people of the area to public bodies were included in delegations he receives from the area to ensure the views he receives are representative?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to local representatives from Garvaghy Road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Local representatives of the SDLP such as Bríd Rodgers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I received no such representations. The Garvaghy Road and Lower Ormeau Road residents requested the meeting.  On previous occasions I met different groupings which included some of the same people as well as members of the SDLP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree, while it is entirely appropriate he should be available to meet people without the intermediation of a public representative from the area in question, it is normal that public representatives would be involved in organising delegations to Ministers as well as to the Taoiseach?  Given that the issue in these discussions is public opinion in the area in question, people who are elected in the area to serve on public bodies have a particular insight into public opinion in all its manifestations as opposed to from only one point of view.  Will the Taoiseach agree, therefore, in regard to future delegations it might be appropriate to consult all the parties who have representatives in the area with a view to allowing them to participate in the <Col N="1092" /> delegation or at least informing them that the delegation is being received, to ensure wide and balanced representation of the views the Taoiseach receives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past I met SDLP delegations, including Bríd Rodgers, and various other groups.  It would be much easier for me and would save much time if the groups would unite in one delegation.  Last year I met various groups on a number of occasions.  The next time I meet those groups I will ask if they will agree to a meeting in a joint group including representatives of the SDLP and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>On 28 May I tabled a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, on the extreme importance of the parade scenario which we face, and in his response the Minister stated that the Government is emphasising the importance of local dialogue and of all concerned contributing to it. Only a tiny fraction of the 2,500 loyal order parades which take place annually in the North are objected to.  The Orange Order and the Apprentice Boys refuse to negotiate with local residents. Will the Taoiseach urge the loyal orders to begin dialogue immediately, recognising that this is the only means by which we can break what is described by some people as a logjam?  Given the unhappy experience with the appointments to the Parades Commission, which is now seen as discredited by many Nationalists in the Six Counties, does the Taoiseach agree the Commission on Policing must be truly independent, impartial, representative and include expert and international participation?  Does he agree it is vital that those appointed are able to fulfil their briefs and that the input of the Irish Government in this matter is crucial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, hope those directly involved in the marching season take account of the British-Irish Agreement.  In many parts of Northern Ireland people are meeting in an effort to resolve these confrontations.  I urge people on all sides to try to reach an accommodation on these matters.  I am encouraged that many communities are doing this, but unfortunately they are not all doing it.  The Deputy referred to the 2,500 parades by the loyal orders.  Of the 3,000 parades that take place, 12 create a difficulty. With innovation and talk, it should not be beyond the bounds of commonsense to find a way to resolve those difficulties.  We are conscious we have not achieved that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>People have to start talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly in respect of the parades on Garvaghy Road, the Lower Ormeau Road and a few others.  There has been more talk between groups outside that net this year, but we must encourage further talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the remarks of the Chief Constable, <Col N="1093" /> Mr. Ronnie Flanagan, to members of the Orange Order when he stated that whatever about their right to march, they should do so in a way that would not impose on the lifestyle of local residents who do not want them to march through their communities.  We must work to reach an accommodation in areas where parades of a confrontational nature take place.  I discussed this matter with the Prime Minister on Monday and through formal and informal contacts with political parties, community bodies and others, the Minister and Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and I have been trying to find a way forward.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the perceptions about the Parades Commission, but having listened to Mr. Alastair Graham and representatives of the residents' groups last week when they met members of parties from this House, I believe they are endeavouring to resolve the difficulties.  I was pleased when I heard Mr. Chris Patton had agreed to accept the position on the Commission on Policing.  He is a senior political figure with vast political experience.  He has also dealt with difficult situations in recent times and has a relatively fair and balanced track record in regard to Northern Ireland.  I would have liked if at least one other nominee, along with Dr. Ger Lynch, had been accepted, but that was the call of the British Government.  I wish the commission well. It will be made up of people with vast experience and in time we will know if their work succeeds. I wish the commission well and will do everything possible to co-operate with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happier if all organisations in Northern Ireland voluntarily stopped marching for at least 12 months to give the Agreement a chance to work.  Does the Taoiseach agree it would be worthwhile to call on all parties in Northern Ireland, including Sinn Féin, to urge their members and supporters to avoid confrontation over marches?  Does he further agree a confrontation cannot take place unless a march is opposed by a group, that people should accept the common sense that conflict will only arise if there is opposition?  Does he agree also that in the interest of the greater good of the community in Northern Ireland and the Agreement that has just been so overwhelmingly endorsed by the people parties should urge their supporters to avoid confrontation over marches?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be better if everybody took a break, but where there are hostilities or enmity is at a high level, that is unlikely. We must acknowledge there are some areas where people are adamant they will march.  We must try to see if we can find a way of avoiding conflicts if there can be route changes or if some of these marches can be rerouted by the commission. The important matter is that there will be no giving in with regard to decisions it makes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, before we come to that, I will continue to talk with the politicians, communities and <Col N="1094" /> residents as will the British Government.  The Prime Minister Mr. Blair and the Secretary of State are adamant about getting people to come to an accommodation.  It is very difficult from a distance to stop people engaging in activities that obviously build up hatred and bitterness regardless of what side of the community they come from.  We will do all we can to try and avoid that. Given that we are dealing with ten or 12 marches out of 3,000, it must be possible to find a resolution if people are not determined to create difficulties. Most people are familiar with the main routes and know what accommodation could be reached, but that requires compromise.  It must be reached this month.  If we reach a <i>quid pro quo</i> people could avoid these confrontations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the attitude of the residents of the Ormeau Road and the Garvaghy Road were not necessarily represented entirely by the residents' associations that came to Dublin last week?  Does he agree there is a wide range of views about these marches in these areas and that it is important the Taoiseach, the Government and the Opposition are not seen to take the side of one group in this dispute about marches?  The Taoiseach should make an effort in the foreseeable future to make it clear to the people of Northern Ireland that we are not taking sides on the issue of marches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People know that having negotiated the Agreement, I did not take sides and was balanced.  People know my view and since it was only signed last month, they will hardly have forgotten already.  In terms of the views put forward by the residents, I know there are other views, but as the Deputy knows, surveys were carried out last year and 98.8 per cent of the people supported the leadership groups.  They were representative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not have answered the question if they knocked on his door?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One would probably do that but when some individuals were challenged about not being representatives some time ago and put their names before the people they were also elected.  Two members were elected and I would be slow to criticise their representation.  However, there are other views and over the past year I met the Orange Order and individual religious people from both sides of the divide to discuss these issues.  I will continue to do that because the matter does not simply affect the Garvaghy Road or the Lower Ormeau Road.  I am conscious of that but these parades go through small stretches, particularly on Garvaghy Road, and it is hard to find an alternative view.  If both sides spoke to <Col N="1095" /> each other I think we could make substantial progress but that is unlikely to happen in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that at least some of the riotous behaviour was not spontaneous?  There seemed to be an element of preparedness, as shown by the presence of petrol bombs.  From that viewpoint, does he agree we should deplore such pre-arranged attempts to organise riots?  Has he any idea who might have been involved in such an arrangement in preparation for the march?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I condemn such behaviour.  It seems a certain number of petrol bombs and a large amount of other debris, including boulders, were readily available.  That is a matter of concern and does not help us avoid a conflict in the next few weeks.  As to the security report, all I have been told is that there were gangs in the area at the time &mdash; there was no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to a particular grouping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I advised them to seek an accommodation to avoid difficulties this year, to work with those who are endeavouring to do that and to do nothing to heighten tension.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They said they were readily available to enter into discussions with the local lodges or the wider organisation to avoid trouble. In the absence of those discussions things are not positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view that the marches should be given a rest for 12 months, if possible.  Last year, a quick decision was taken to allow the march to proceed down Garvaghy Road.  This was done while negotiations were taking place, and despite assurances that no decision would be taken before the negotiators were informed.  In his conversations with the British authorities, I ask the Taoiseach to endeavour to ensure that is not repeated.  Given the significance of reforming the RUC, such a repetition would present an ugly picture which would do nothing to help in that reform.</P>
      <P>Given the use of religious symbolism and places of worship in these marches, could the Taoiseach make special efforts to meet the two archbishops of Armagh and those directly responsible to them to ensure no such places of worship are inadvertently used to add to tension, and that everything is done to disperse such tension which is building even at present?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Archbishop Brady and Archbishop Eames have consistently made their positions clear.  The important thing is to deal with the parades issue and to manage it in an open and fair manner.  We must continue to do that.  It would be wishful thinking to imagine all the parades would not take place this year &mdash; people have made clear that is not going to happen. The Parades Commission, under its rules, must issue its report five days before a particular march.  Some people on the commission and elsewhere think it should give its opinion earlier. That is still an open question with the Parades Commission.  Certainly it would assist but, if my recollection is correct, the Deputy was present on the last occasion and the decision was only conveyed to me shortly after 4 a.m. The residents may have known a little earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because hundreds of troops had descended on their area at 2.30 a.m. That was not very satisfactory.  All of that will not help.  We have to get those directly involved to see whether we can find some understanding on these issues.  As of today, local representatives on the Nationalist side are prepared to talk and maybe some on the Unionist side as well.  There is no indication of any support from the lodges for talks with local residents.  If we could find some way of dealing with that it might be helpful. There has been the difficulty previously of the local lodges saying they would talk to certain people in the residents' committee and not to others.  This never seems to work out successfully. We will continue over the coming weeks to do all we can to de-escalate the position.  We should take account of the views on all sides with a view to reaching some accommodation between the various groups.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that unfortunately we have to bear in mind a consideration this year which we did not have to consider in previous years, that is, the involvement on both sides of groups opposed to the British-Irish Agreement who are seeking opportunities to wreck the Agreement?  In those circumstances there is a special responsibility, if only in their own interests, on David Trimble and Sinn Féin to try to find a solution to this problem.  It is in their interest because of the nature of the attack being made that they find an answer to this problem. Will the Taoiseach further agree that in the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement, a phrase being used &mdash; which was archaic but is now anachronistic &mdash; which refers to Northern Ireland as the Six Counties is not in the spirit of the Agreement and should be stopped?

      <P>In the various groups, David Trimble as leader of the Unionist party, Sinn Féin and everybody else has a responsibility to ensure we reach some accommodation.  Otherwise, it could be very damaging to what we are trying to do.  At a time when we are starting the commission on policing and dealing with the equality agenda and several of the key areas, including the prisoners issues and many other matters on which work will continue right through the summer, anything people can do to calm the situation and avoid conflict should be done.  I do not want to say it is anybody's responsibility more than anybody else's.  We all have to work at it.  In terms of names attached to areas, I note what the Deputy has said.  As the Deputy will be aware, both North and South people still use the old terms.  The Deputy is aware of the term I always use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree the reason I put particular emphasis on Sinn Féin and David Trimble was because there are groupings involved who are aiming at Sinn Féin and David Trimble to cause problems for them, so it is in their interests to be involved?  So far as the second part of my question is concerned, I am aware that this terminology in Northern Ireland relates more to the 1920s than to the present but the phrase to which I referred, &ldquo;Six Counties&rdquo;, is one that should not get official support.  It is contrary to the spirit of the British-Irish Agreement. Will the Taoiseach heed the advice I am giving him in relation to having a word with a certain backbencher who used this phrase in a question today?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Will the Taoiseach recognise that it is futile to look to the Parades Commission for a solution to the difficulties presenting themselves in regard to the marching season?  The Parades Commission is a discredited body which does not have any authority.  It was unlikely to sort out the problem as an outside body removed from the reality of the situation.  It would be better for the Taoiseach to recognise that, stand down the Parades Commission and give a powerful impetus to local agreement, recognising the right to march and express one's views and the right of communities not to be put upon or humiliated.  A powerful impetus towards real dialogue among the groups at a local level is the only way a permanent solution can be found to the tensions caused by parades.  In that way, this nightmare problem would not arise every year in these communities but would be sorted out by agreement once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to the first question, we urge all those directly involved to approach this issue in the spirit of the British-Irish Agreement which was approved by an overwhelming majority of the people in this island. They sent a clear message that difficult issues should be resolved through dialogue and accommodation, <Col N="1098" /> and I urge all sides to reach an accommodation.</P>
      <P>There are difficult issues before the Parades Commission on which the commission will make a determination and it will fall on the security forces to implement those decisions.  The commission will not be slowed down by the British Government.  Regardless of the level of influence of the Parades Commission on the situation this year, it will continue to have a role; time will tell the extent of that role.  The commission has highlighted its difficulties and we cannot discount them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask several questions relating to the questions I put down.  In relation to my earlier question about urging all parties to call on their supporters and their members to avoid confrontation, will the Taoiseach agree that would include calling on people not to travel to these flashpoints, to avoid the political voyeurism that seems to take place every year where people from outside these areas travel to them to witness this confrontation while many people who live in these areas leave them to avoid this confrontation?  If the crowds that are bussed in and encouraged to travel to these areas were discouraged from doing so, it would be a significant step in de-escalating the tension surrounding these marches.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that constantly referring to the commission as being incapable of doing the job is destructive?  The commission exists to do the job in relation to parades.  People can have their views as to its makeup but the fact remains that there is no other mechanism for making an independent decision in relation to parades.  Unfortunately, as the Taoiseach said, the security forces will be in the firing line yet again regardless of the decision the commission makes. It is wrong, therefore, for people in this House to constantly declare that the commission is unworkable and useless because it is the only light at the end of the tunnel in relation to these flashpoint marches.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement in regard to the commission for victims in the Republic of violence related to the Northern Ireland conflict.  However, would it not be better to have that commission under the aegis of his Department rather than the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which according to press reports is his intention?  What does he see as the purpose of the commission?  When will its terms of reference be available to the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very helpful if people did not travel to locations.  Some of the real difficulties last year and the year before were caused by people travelling, particularly in Derry last year.  This time last year we were urging the people from the Garvaghy Road not to bring in outsiders.  They did not do so but left it to the community itself, which I acknowledged at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> I have already commented on the Parades Commission.  I strongly supported its setting up last year.  There is no point in ignoring its setbacks but it is still operating to the extent it can.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Deputy's remarks in regard to victims of violence.  A former Tánaiste, John Wilson, is to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place in this jurisdiction to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years and to identify what measures need to be taken to address the concerns of those in question, to recognise the suffering of victims and to acknowledge and sustain the support given to victims and their families in helping them cope with the immediate aftermath and continuing consequences of violence.  This will include consideration of the concerns of families of members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces who died or sustained serious injury as a consequence of violent acts ensuing from the conflict and the services and support available to the victims and their families of major outrages, such as the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings.</P>

      <P>
        <i>I met last week with representatives of the Garvaghy Road Residents' Coalition and the Lower Ormeau Concerned Community to discuss the issue of parades.  I also met briefly with members of the Parades Commission when I dropped in to a lunch hosted by Senator Edward Haughey.</i>
      </P>
      <P>
        <i>At these meetings I took the opportunity to stress the importance of dialogue and accommodation and the Government's view that we could not allow this year's marches to threaten the Agreement that everybody has worked so hard to achieve.  Both residents' groups expressed their fears and concerns about the situation.  I hope that the message which is being clearly expressed by ordinary people in both communities &mdash; that they do not want conflict &mdash; will be heeded by all of those directly involved.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>I and the Government are very anxious to see a situation brought about in which there can be a balanced, fair and agreed accommodation of the rights of the various groups involved, in the spirit</i>
      <Col N="1102" />
      <i>of the commitments given by all the participants to the Good Friday Agreement to the achievement of reconciliation, tolerance and mutual trust and to the protection and vindication of the human rights of all; and drawing on the accepted principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of esteem.  The Government, and I personally, will do all we possibly can to encourage an accommodation on this issue, which will be receiving the highest priority in the weeks ahead.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>My most recent phone conversation with President Clinton was on Saturday 23 May &mdash; as the results of the referendums on the Good Friday Agreement were coming in.  I was delighted to be able to convey personally to the President the news of the decisive and overwhelming endorsement given by the people of this island &mdash; North and South &mdash; to the Agreement and to thank him for his own personal input and the input of his Administration in helping to bring about this very positive chapter in Ireland's history.</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>I also met last week with Sir Kenneth Bloomfield. I congratulated him on his report and the work he had done in the presentation of the cases of the victims of violence.  This is an important part of the healing process and, as the Minister for Justice announced recently, the former Tánaiste Mr John Wilson will carry out a similar exercise for victims of the violence from a southern perspective.</i>

    <P>
      <i>It is not proposed to change the present arrangements with regard to Northern Ireland Affairs.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach see any merit in the establishment of a separate Department of Northern Ireland Affairs, with its own Cabinet Minister?  The responsibilities of the Minister for Foreign Affairs appear to be over extended, given that he must deal with Northern Ireland, the EU and other foreign affairs matters. Under the Agreement, further detailed activity will be necessary on Northern Ireland, not least with regard to the proposed North/South ministerial council and the British-Irish Council.  The UK Government has a separate Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to speculate on what may happen in the future.  The arrangements which have been in place for some years have worked well.  These include a powerful section within my Department and a section within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Over the past ten months, certainly since September, the Minister for Foreign Affairs spent at least four days a week in Northern Ireland up until the Agreement.  More usually in the past he would <Col N="1103" /> have spent a day or a day and a half a week there. Other Ministers will be involved in the creation of the North/South ministerial council.  We will continue with present arrangements until that stage when we will be in a position to see how the Agreement will be implemented.</P>

      <P>My questions are prompted by earlier responses.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the time frame of the events that unfolded on the Garvaghy Road last Saturday and of the reported detail of the use by youths of two hastily constructed petrol bombs?  It is important this is made known to the Taoiseach because it would allow him to scotch any inference in the earlier question from Deputy O'Keeffe about the involvement of any other hand in what happened.  From the information before me, the sinister hand of last Saturday did not emerge either from the local community or from organised Nationalist resistance.</P>
      <P>Addressing not the symptom but what is at the core of these difficulties, does the Taoiseach recognise that if the Orange Order, which called for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the recent referendum, continues in its refusal to engage in dialogue and if it insists on imposing itself on communities then &mdash; Deputy Currie will confirm this &mdash; it will be among those who are attempting to wreck the new political dispensation, both within the Six Counties and with regard to the new island arrangements that have emerged as a result of the document's endorsement?</P>

      <P>There are people intent on causing trouble and they will use whatever opportunity is available to them during and beyond the marching season to create difficulties.  Those directly involved have to try to work together to build confidence.  I am heartened by the pace at which a number of issues are being advanced.  The issues of prisoners, policing, equality, the preparation of legislation and the administration of justice have been advanced in a short period.  It will take time &mdash; into the middle of next year &mdash; to prepare and implement the reports which will be comprehensive. We have to keep the agenda away from those who want to create difficulties and undermine the Agreement.</P>

      <P>Before commencing priority questions I remind Members of the new procedure which comes into effect today for an experimental period until the summer recess. Under the new procedure there will be 30 minutes overall for priority questions.  Each priority question will be taken and given six minutes.  The first two minutes will be devoted to <Col N="1104" /> the Minister's initial reply and the remaining four minutes to supplementary questions and replies. Strict time limits will be enforced by the Chair who will strike the bell when the two minutes for the Minister's initial reply have expired and again when the four minutes for supplementary questions and replies have expired, whereupon the Chair will immediately call the next question. Where two or more priority questions are taken together the time limits will be doubled.  For example, if the first two priority questions are taken together, the Minister will have four minutes and there will be eight minutes for supplementary questions and replies.  The new procedure is experimental as a way of ensuring each priority question is taken without overrunning into ordinary question time.  I ask Members to co-operate with the Chair in observing the strict time limits imposed by the new sessional order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in response to private notice questions on 26 May 1998, I had stressed that day to the executive chairman and senior management of Aer Lingus and TEAM the importance of assessing the implications of the previous evening's response of the TEAM workforce to the FLS proposals.  I had asked the executive chairman to submit to me at an early date his assessment of the future direction of TEAM in light of the current circumstances.  I said I would be conveying essentially the same message to the TEAM unions when I met them.</P>
      <P>I met on Friday last, 29 May 1998, with a large representative grouping of the TEAM unions &mdash; 24 in all.  I listened carefully to their views and conveyed my own views to them.  For their part, a range of views were expressed.  Some indicated that they regarded the consultation process which had led to last week's outcome as being finalised and that they did not require any further clarification on issues which had arisen in that process. Others, however, felt that important issues such as pension arrangements had not been sufficiently clarified.  A common position that was expressed on behalf of the unions was that they were willing to engage on a partnership basis with Aer Lingus management and the Government to find a solution for TEAM that would secure its future.</P>
      <P>For my part, I reiterated that my overriding concern at all times has been to secure the maximum level of employment in TEAM into the future and that any strategic developments in relation to the ownership of TEAM would only take place with the concurrence of the TEAM workforce.  I also expressed the personal views which I had expressed in this House last week that, first, the letters issued in 1990 to each Aer Lingus staff member transferring to TEAM were letters of guarantee of employment in Aer Lingus but that the concept of a job for life was no longer valid in today's commercial world; second, that TEAM as a subsidiary of Aer Lingus did not have a viable future; and, third, that the best prospects for a secure viable future for TEAM lay with the proposals for the acquisition of the company by FLS Aerospace.</P>
      <P>I urged the unions to enter into further talks with the management of Aer Lingus as soon as possible, in which all the concerns and viewpoints of both sides would be thoroughly addressed.  I met yesterday with the executive chairman of Aer Lingus who informed me that talks are scheduled for 3 p.m. today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It follows from the foregoing that I have not yet received any proposals from the board of Aer Lingus.  I cannot predict when the process will be completed and a Government decision required. <Col N="1106" /> This issue should be addressed with urgency.  The union representatives, almost to a person, said the use of the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; was inimical to the prospects of a deal.  I have not attempted to put precise statistical parameters on what might represent workforce concurrence to any deal, as to do so would be unhelpful.</P>
    <P>As to the question of alternatives to the proposed FLS deal, on Friday last, 29 May 1998, subsequent to the meeting I had with the TEAM unions, my Department was contacted by Mr. Ulick McEvaddy who indicated that his company may be interested in TEAM Aer Lingus.  He said he would give further consideration to this idea and would contact the Department again on the matter this week.  I informed the chairman of this yesterday.  It remains to be seen whether and how Mr. McEvaddy follows up on this approach.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister, as shareholder, had discussions with FLS?  In discussions with the Minister, the Department or management in TEAM Aer Lingus or Aer Lingus has FLS indicated a timescale within which it might withdraw if the matter is not agreed?  What is the Minister's game plan?  Will there be a further ballot or is it the case, if FLS goes off into the ether, that that will be okay too?  Does the Minister have a clear view of where she wants to get to and when?</P>

I indicated that TEAM, as a subsidiary of Aer Lingus, does not have a viable future and that the best prospects for a secure viable future for TEAM lay with the proposals for the acquisition of the company by FLS Aerospace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is belated but welcome.  Is the Minister aware of a letter from Mr. John O'Neill, the general manager of Aer Lingus, of 10 April 1990 sent to all the staff?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In contradiction of what the Minister said recently, he gave a solid undertaking in that letter.  He stated that in the unlikely event of TEAM getting into business difficulties, the existing <Col N="1107" /> employees of TEAM would be retained to maintain, at a minimum, the Aer Lingus fleet in TEAM.  Would the Minister agree the current bill for the maintenance of the Aer Lingus fleet is £28 million?  Aer Lingus expects that to escalate to £65 million when it completes the purchase of its fleet.  That would represent 75 per cent of the capacity of TEAM.  Will the Minister agree that if Aer Lingus did not have a maintenance section it would be well advised to develop one, but given that it has one and the maintenance of its fleet will take up 75 per cent of the capacity of TEAM Aer Lingus, its subsidiary, it would be madness for Aer Lingus to get rid of that subsidiary because it would have to buy that service elsewhere at a higher price?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.  It was dated 10 April and it is in the Official Report.  I read it line by line.  On foot of it I said it was my personal opinion &mdash; not my legal opinion because I do not have a legal background and a legal opinion has not been obtained on this through the court procedures &mdash; that was a guarantee of re-employment or of a transfer back to Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the employees I met on Friday that was my personal opinion.  I thought that should have been cleared up before now.  On the question of personal guarantees for life employment, I cannot guarantee that because if things go badly for TEAM, which I hope will not happen, and staff have the option to transfer back, I do not believe there would be employment for that number of people in Aer Lingus. That relates to the point I discussed last week. Aer Lingus had to succumb to various plans because of the difficulties it faced in the past. Under those plans a series of voluntary redundancies were put into operation and most of the Members present were in Dáil Éireann at that time.  We know the anguish and the great anxiety <Col N="1108" /> caused by that process.  If the Deputy is proposing that all staff should be able to transfer back to Aer Lingus and be employed as crafts persons, I cannot project what the future would be in that regard.  I cannot see how there would be employment for that number of crafts persons in Aer Lingus.  If there were not jobs suitable to the talents of that number of people, one would have to reach a certain conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said the current cost of maintaining the Aer Lingus fleet is £28 million and when its new fleet comes on stream that cost will increase to £65 million.  I do not have those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The unions put that point to me and I put it to the chairman yesterday.  That gives rise to the obvious point that a new fleet of aircraft would not require the heavy maintenance costs an older fleet would require.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of public moneys already committed to the design of the Luas project as approved by the previous Government and whether any refund will be required to be repaid to the European Commission in view of the Government's decision not to proceed with the proposal as previously planned; the likely cost and timeframe for the construction of the proposed city centre tunnel; the initial assessment, if any, she has as to the gradients of this tunnel based on geological assessment to date of the rock structure in the area in question; and the proposed number of city centre stop points with portal holes on the tunnel.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has received claims from CIE for the recoupment of expenditure totalling £19 million on planning and design of the light rail project to the end of 1997.  This figure comprises approximately £12 million of EU aid and the balance of £7 million in Exchequer funding.  Payments to the company of approximately £10 million in EU aid and approximately £6 million in Exchequer funding have been made to date.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the short 1.5 kilometre section between St. Stephen's Green and Abbey Street, this expenditure has been undertaken in respect of routes which are included within the enhanced network agreed by Government.  On this basis the EU Commission has been asked to confirm that the expenditure continues to be eligible for Structural Fund assistance and the Commission's decision is expected shortly.</P>
      <P>CIE will shortly go to tender to recruit consultants to undertake the detailed technical evaluation of the underground section.  Once they are recruited they will commence the necessary preliminary studies.  The physical work necessary, such as the drilling of trial boreholes, is expected to get under way early in 1999 and will take about nine months to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That detailed work will provide the information <Col N="1110" /> necessary to determine the specification for the underground section, including the required gradients and the number and location of stations.  It will also assist in determining a firm cost estimate for construction and, subject to the relevant statutory procedures, the likely implementation timetable.  I consider that it would be prudent to await the outcome of these studies before commenting further on the details of the project.</P>

Will she indicate the position on the public inquiry?  Has it been aborted, has she had consultations with Mr. Justice Sean O'Leary or what will happen now there is a revised proposal?  How many portals will the blackhole tunnel, roller-coaster, or whatever it will be called, have?  It will go underground at St. Stephen's Green, overground and underground until it reaches O'Connell Street and overground and underground until it reaches Broadstone. Will there be one portal?

      <P>The EU directive concerning the Internal Market in electricity came into force on 19 February 1997.  It must be implemented by February 2000.</P>
      <P>It requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition at that time, increasing to 32 per cent by 2003.  This will allow independent electricity generators to contract directly with eligible customers for the supply of electricity.  Eligible customers will be those who will be free to choose their electricity supplier in the competitive market.</P>
      <P>Customers consuming more than 100 giga watt hours &mdash; GWh &mdash; per year, which represents about 8 per cent of electricity sold, are automatically eligible.  The remaining 20 per cent is likely to comprise customers consuming more than 4GWh per year.  The majority of customers, which were known as the captive market when I took office and are now known as the franchise market, will continue to be supplied exclusively by the ESB.</P>
      <P>The directive provides for new generation to be acquired by tendering or by authorisation.  The proposals I published on 15 May last, which were circulated to the main spokespersons, set out the manner in which it is intended the directive will be implemented.  It is proposed that firms wishing to establish generating stations here would be authorised, that is, granted a licence by the regulatory authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed legislation to implement the EU electricity directive enables me as the Minister to issue the first licences required to initiate the new arrangements for the electricity industry.  These will be licences issued to the ESB to generate, transmit, distribute and supply electricity.  Any other undertaking operating or ready to commence the generation or supply of electricity at <Col N="1112" /> the time of vesting of the new arrangements will also be licensed.  Thereafter, all licences will be issued by the regulatory authority.</P>

Does the Minister agree in the context of the recent British-Irish Agreement that this may be the first occasion for the fullest possible co-operation on energy matters?

      <P>The location of a tunnel portal for the underground section is one of the issues which the CIE light rail project team will examine before it submits its application for a light railway order in respect of the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line.  At this stage, it expects, subject to the necessary technical confirmation, to be in a position to submit its application before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Regarding traffic congestion, the Dublin Transportation Office has nearly completed an action plan designed to address the growing transportation deficit arising from the unprecedented level of traffic growth in recent years.  I understand that the plan will propose short-term measures, including public transport measures, which can be taken over the next two years to deal with the problems of traffic congestion not only in the area served by the Sandyford line but throughout the city.  I also understand measures will be taken by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding traffic.  The DTO proposals will be available soon.</P>

      <P>If the drilling results indicate that St. Stephen's Green is an unsuitable location to commence a tunnel or, as appears more likely, the public inquiry and the EIS show that the environmental impact of digging up Stephen's Green is unsustainable, clearly the completion of the Harcourt Street portion of the line is in disarray and we are back to square one.  The Minister said in her reply that nothing can be done until we have an evaluation of the underground section, which is due in the year 2000.  If we wait until then to make a decision, we may well find ourselves back at the drawing board.  If the Minister appreciates the bind we are in as a result of this change of plan, does she appreciate that she must make the decision to bring the Harcourt Street line to Stephen's Green, no matter what the outcome of the tunnel investigation?  Otherwise we will find ourselves unable to complete the Harcourt Street line, which may be sacrificed for a tunnel that might not be built.</P>

I think the Deputy's dates were incorrect.  Preliminary studies on underground sections of Stephen's Green-Broadstone are scheduled for autumn-winter 1998, then borehole drilling on underground sections for Stephen's Green-Broadstone in spring-autumn 1999.  The Deputy's point was one we discussed informally in the corridor. It seems a simple answer that might work, but apparently in light rail order terms, which are legal, it would not be feasible.</P>

      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Question No. 34 of 2 April 1998, she will introduce legislation to force mobile phone companies to share their telecommunications masts rather than supporting the principle of sharing masts; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the points I made in my reply to the question the Deputy refers to. The Interconnection Regulations (S.  I. No. 15 of 1998), which I signed into law earlier this year, provide that in cases where operators cannot <Col N="1116" /> come to an agreement on facility sharing, the Director of Telecommunications Regulation is empowered to intervene to resolve disputes.  The director may impose facility or property sharing arrangements after an appropriate period of public consultation, during which all interested parties must be given an opportunity to express their views.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this approach maintains a correct balance between the freedom of operation of communications service providers, on the one hand, and the need to avoid the unnecessary proliferation of new communications masts, on the other.</P>
      <P>Given the powers provided to the director under the interconnection regulations I do not consider that further legislation to force mobile phone companies to share their masts is necessary or practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at a recent meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprise, the Secretary General of her own Department said that it was legally impossible to enforce sharing of masts?  In the Minister's reply today and that of 2 April she states that the director has the power to impose sharing of facilities.  In other words companies could be forced to use one mast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Is the Minister aware of any mast in the country which Telecom Éireann and Esat Digifone share?  Is it the case that if they do not apply to one another to share the mast there cannot be a dispute, which means the director cannot intervene, making the regulations useless? Is it the case that both bodies are going their own way, putting up separate masts in every town and village, and nobody has any power to do anything because the regulations are ineffective?</P>

Will she change the regulations to force Telecom Éireann and Esat Digifone to share masts, as per her policy decision, or will she give instructions to Telecom Éireann to apply to share every Esat Digifone mast in the country to stop the proliferation of masts?</P>

It seems that some coercion is required from her Department on Telecom Éireann and Esat Digifone to oblige them to share.  They are not co-existing.  She should reconsider the reply she gave, which was quite surprising.  In England and elsewhere there are very effective environmentally sensitive masts that look like trees or street lamps.

      <P>In addition to issues directly relating to the Government's ongoing campaign against Sellafield and the UK nuclear industry generally, the committee's work programme will include a review of the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents, issues arising in regard to the County Louth residents' legal action against BNFL, a review of radon remediation measures and progress in regard to implementation of the EU Basic Safety Standards Directive.</P>
      <P>The committee did not consider the recent ban on shipments of nuclear waste to the reprocessing plants at La Hague in France and at Sellafield as this issue arose after the committee last met.  I was concerned to learn that a number of containers arriving at both plants were found to have radiation levels in excess of the acceptable limits.</P>
      <P>I understand the German Federal Government has introduced a series of actions to deal with the problem including an investigation into the contamination, the introduction of a better reporting system, an improvement in technical measures and a ban on any further shipments until the transport system has been reorganised.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the highest levels of safety are enforced in the transport of radioactive materials.  I have been assured by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that the incident is of no radiological significance to Ireland. Nevertheless, I am concerned about the dangers associated with the transport of nuclear fuel which have been highlighted by this incident and my Department will raise this matter at a meeting of the UK/Ireland Contact Group on radioactivity and nuclear safety matters tomorrow.</P>

Does that programme include any action relating to the transportation of nuclear and irradiated materials through the Irish Sea, particularly in light of the fact that the German authorities recently concluded that it is unsafe to transport nuclear waste?  How many shipments of nuclear waste are transported <i>via</i> the Irish Sea?

      <P>The committee's work programme will be broadly based.  Apart from the ongoing campaign against Sellafield and the other matters listed in my original reply, the committee will discuss issues such as the project sponsored by the Department of Health and Children on epidemiological research relating to the impact of Sellafield in the North Eastern Health Board area and initiatives taken by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources in respect of the transport of radioactive waste on the Irish Sea.  As chairman of the committee I will review, with fellow <Col N="1121" /> members, the matters in respect of which we can make a positive contribution.</P>
      <P>The committee set out a comprehensive programme of work, details of which I will be glad to make available to the Deputy.  As already stated, the programme will include the campaign against Sellafield and all it entails, discharge authorisations, Magnox reactors, HLW storage and the transport of spent fuels on the Irish Sea.  It will also include a review of our progress on BNFL's application to the UK Environment Agency on the justification for a new MOX plant. The EU inspectorate for nuclear facilities will also be considered.  There is a wide range of activities, including the issue of the transportation of nuclear waste in the Irish Sea.  We will be dealing with the various aspects of the OSPAR convention, the International Atomic Energy Agency and international conventions.</P>
      <P>We will also consider the County Louth residents' court action, nuclear liability and basic safety standards.  We will review progress on the implementation of the EU Directive 96/29 EUR-ATOM and other directives.  We will be dealing with radon on an ongoing basis.  Other items in the work programme will be emergency planning and the draft Ireland-UK bilateral agreement on the exchange of information on radiological protection.</P>

      <P>I am reminded of the old saying &ldquo;You never ring, you never write&rdquo;.  Will the Minister of State agree that there has been a dearth of activity in his Department on nuclear safety?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Will he agree that downplaying the public campaign against Sellafield and related nuclear dangers since he took office has had the effect of letting the British off the hook?  In a situation where Sellafield is leaking like a sieve and enough atomic fuel was stolen from Dounreay to make five atomic bombs the silence from the Irish Government is deafening.  The nuclear energy committee which was set up under pressure from the Opposition has only met twice in 12 months. Does the Minister of State agree that such a level of activity is not sufficient?  Will he seek support from the Cabinet and the committee to raise its activity to a level at which the British will realise we are worried about the matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the work programme set out, will the Minister of State agree that more needs to be done about radon gas?  It is a serious threat about which many people are not aware. Is all well with regard to the STAD court case? Can the Minister of State reassure the House that the case is proceeding satisfactorily and that all necessary research funding is being provided by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State revise his reference to acceptable levels of radiation?  In the case of radon we must accept the facts of life and do what we can about them.  However, the Minister of State should not speak in terms of acceptable levels of man made radiation.  Will he forward the programme of work and the terms of reference of the ministerial committee to me? What is the remit of the committee with regard to the Dounreay controversy?  According to the North Scottish News Service enough sensitive uranium to make a dozen atomic bombs is missing from Dounreay.  Can that matter be dealt with along with the German shipments issue at the next committee meeting?  When will that meeting be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is aware that the German Government has halted all shipments of nuclear waste.  Will the Government seek a complete ban on nuclear waste shipments in the Irish Sea?  Will it permit a regime in the Irish Sea which is less stringent than that being applied by the German authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Stagg that there has been a diminution in activity.  On the contrary, there is a steady effort being made in the campaign against Sellafield and for nuclear safety in general.  In accordance with the programme for Government, the Government is working strongly on the issue.  I refute what the Deputy has said in that regard.</P>
      <P>The committee has met twice in three months &mdash; once is February on its formation and once in May.  On a <i>pro rata</i> rate that would be eight meetings per annum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving specific answers to specific questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates referred to radon gas.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle might chide me if I deal with that matter given that the matter is raised in <Col N="1123" /> another of Deputy Stagg's questions.  The issue of the STAD court case is also the subject of another question.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Sargent, there are no acceptable levels of radiation as far as the Department, the Government and I are concerned. I will forward the programme of work and the terms of reference of the committee to the Deputy.  The Dounreay issue is an extension of the question, but it is topical&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Sargent will find another way to raise the matter.</P>
      <P>The German Government has decided to review the arrangements for the shipment of nuclear waste in the light of the recent incident and to impose tighter controls.  I am pleased with the way it has tackled this issue.  My Department, with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, will keep in touch with developments in Germany.  For the moment I will not make direct representations to the German authorities in the light of the intensive measures being taken. However, I will not rule out making such contacts if I deem it necessary.</P>
      <P>Among the actions taken by the German Government was the stopping of all shipments of nuclear waste on 21 May 1998 after it emerged that the surface of German nuclear waste containers arriving at reprocessing plants at La Hague in France and Sellafield in Britain were found to be contaminated.</P>

      <P>Today is 3 June.  The Taoiseach is due to attend the Cardiff summit.  Is he satisfied there is adequate time between now and the end of June to meet the obligations this country has entered into and which were endorsed by the electorate?</P>

      <P>Item No. 69 of the Government's programme of legislation is the prevention of corruption Bill which will allow for ratification of the OECD/European Union Convention on combating bribery and corruption. When does the Taoiseach expect it to be brought before the House?  How far advanced is the legislation? I assume it could be discussed quickly given that it is simply a Bill to allow for the ratification of these Conventions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was due at the end of this year, but could drift into early next year.  There is an enormous amount of legislation in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It now must take on and give priority to at least half <Col N="1130" /> a dozen measures under the British-Irish Agreement. I am afraid it will probably drift into 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to present this Bill, whose purpose is to provide for the establishment of a statutory body to be known as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, which will have full responsibility for all food safety and hygiene matters.  This honours the Government's commitment on food safety as <Col N="1132" /> outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>Since taking office this Government has attached particular importance to the issue of food safety generally and the concerns of consumers in particular.  It recognises the need for uncompromised and independently verifiable assurances on food safety to ensure consumer confidence.  While the primary purpose of the Bill is the protection of consumers, the Government also recognises that one of the best ways of promoting the food sector is to put in place a strong, independent and science-based food safety authority, which will have the confidence of consumers at home and abroad.  The provisions of this Bill will not only contribute to public health but will also serve the economic development of the food sector.</P>
      <P>Food scares are nothing new.  For many years we have been warned of the dangers of using unpasteurised milk and the need for proper hygiene in the home and have been advised on the proper cooking of food.  Then came BSE and the possibility of a link with new variant CJD. Suddenly the script was re-written.  Images of brains turning to sponge as a result of cattle being fed bone meal seemed like something from a Stephen King horror novel.  Consumer faith in our food industry to produce safe wholesome food was severely undermined.  As if BSE was not enough, e-coli 0157 claimed the lives of a number of elderly people in Scotland.  If we add in the threats caused by drug-resistant salmonella strains, antibiotic residues in pork, angel dust and other illegal growth promoters, it is little wonder that consumers treat vague reassurances with scepticism.  Other concerns have been voiced in relation to new crop developments and food processes, such as the increasing availability of genetically modified foods and food irradiation.</P>
      <P>It is clear that consumers are concerned about food safety and it behoves any Government to listen to and respond appropriately to these concerns. I assure the House that this Government will not be found wanting in this regard.  The protection of public health is an absolute priority for me, as it is for all of my colleagues in Government. Any threat to the safety of the food we eat, whether it be real or potential, will be responded to robustly and with transparency.  It is therefore imperative that we have a structure in place that can adequately identify and assess the risk in a competent, professional manner and then communicate clearly and effectively with both consumers and providers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1996 the previous Government appointed an interim Food Safety Authority on a non-statutory basis and proceeded to draft a Bill to put this authority on a statutory footing.  The thrust of the proposed Bill was to establish the authority as a &ldquo;regulator of regulators&rdquo;&mdash; that is, responsibility for food control services would remain with existing agencies, but these would be audited by the authority which would have a role in the setting and maintaining of standards and <Col N="1133" /> the promotion of good practice.  Despite numerous promises, that Bill had not been published prior to the 1997 general election.</P>
    <P>When the previous Government outlined its plans, we in Opposition vigorously opposed them, not for the sake of opposition but because we strongly felt that the proposals were wholly inadequate. What we would have had was a toothless body supervising the same agencies carrying on their business in the same way, despite everyone recognising the need for a fresh approach to food safety.  The only new element proposed by the previous Government was that the food safety authority would have an audit function but this, in our view, fell far short of the radical change and imaginative solution which is required.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to convey the impression that the existing State agencies responsible for food controls have not done a fine job in the past.  I fully acknowledge the commitment and professionalism which these agencies have demonstrated in dealing with what is an increasingly complex environment.  However, it is this very complexity which now dictates the requirement for a central authority, which will harmonise the State response to the food safety challenge.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that the interests of consumers are better served by the creation of an authority which will be directly accountable for all food control functions.  As pointed out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this new authority will take over all current functions related to food safety from existing agencies and will be independent, science based and provide for full traceability.  This Bill has all the features identified in the programme for Government, with the exception of the immediate transfer of staff from the existing agencies to the authority. I will explain the rationale behind this adjustment to our original proposal.  Responsibility for food controls currently rests with a wide number of Departments and agencies and is delivered by a broad range of disciplines.  In all some 50 State agencies and many hundreds of staff are currently involved in the delivery of food control services. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for such staff to have other duties, in addition to food controls, assigned to them.  It is not possible, therefore, definitively to identify &ldquo;food control&rdquo; staff individually. In view of this, the transfer of all relevant staff from existing agencies to the new authority will take some time and will only take place after detailed discussion and agreement with staff representative bodies.</P>
    <P>The Bill will, therefore, provide the authority with the capacity to discharge its functions by way of contractual agreements.  These agreements, or service contracts as they are described in section 48 of the Bill, will be agreed between the authority and the State agencies in relation to the wide range of food safety functions contained in existing legislation.  Lists of this legislation and the State agencies involved are included in the Schedules to the Bill.  Each service contract will include the targets and objectives which the authority <Col N="1134" /> wishes the agency to meet, and the timeframe within which these must be achieved.  Existing funding arrangements will be maintained &mdash; that is, the agencies will make the resources available to meet their contractual obligations.  The authority will publish details of the contracts and will introduce a system of monitoring to ensure the agreements are being adhered to.  If contracts are not satisfactorily performed, the authority will report to the Minister for Health and Children who will arrange for such reports to be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, in section 49, for the appointment of authorised officers to carry out statutory food safety functions.  These officers will be furnished with an official warrant issued by the authority, or by the official agency on its behalf. I have already established the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on an interim basis by way of statutory instrument under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961, with effect from 1 January 1998.  This arrangement was put in place to allow the authority to recruit staff and to facilitate the development of structures in advance of the Bill being enacted.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the authority, as outlined in section 12, will be to promote, encourage and foster high standards of safety and hygiene at all stages of the food chain from primary production to final use by the customer.  A key objective for the authority will be to bring about acceptance that primary responsibility for the safety of food rests with producers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and caterers.  It is also incumbent on the authority to encourage a greater awareness among consumers of good food safety and hygiene practices.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill provides in detail for a policing and enforcement role for the authority, its main aim is to foster, through education and promotion, a food safety culture among providers and consumers which characterises the food chain from the farm to the fork.  The establishment of such a culture will serve public health much better than any system which relies merely on the enforcement of a regulatory regime.</P>
    <P>The authority's role in enforcement is not being neglected and it will carry out, through the contracts negotiated with the agencies, inspections, approval, licensing and registration of food premises and equipment.  It will also be responsible for the sampling and analysis of food and inspection of food labelling.  In order to maintain full traceability, the authority's remit shall extend to farms, other places of primary production, water treatment plants and any other source of materials used in food production.  The Bill, through section 30, gives the authority the power to seek reports from any State body on a matter which, in its opinion, impinges on food safety and to report to the Minister for Health and Children.  This provision is very wide-ranging and does not confine the authority's remit to particular parts of the food chain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The Bill provides for the authority's involvement, either on its own initiative or in co-operation with food producers' representatives, in the establishment of schemes to protect consumer interests.  These schemes, described in section 13 as food safety assurance schemes, will cover the promotion of best practice and preparation of guidelines on raw materials, processing, packaging, preparation, storage and handling.</P>
    <P>While the formulation of national food safety policy will remain with my Department, I foresee the authority playing a very important role in the formulation of this policy.  As was the case with the food safety advisory board, which has now been merged with the new authority, the Government will rely on the professional expertise of the authority to advise on matters such as nutrition, food technology and industrial practices and the cultivation of food plants and animals.  This advisory role, outlined in section 15, will also extend to issues such as food labelling and packaging and the very important area of improving systems for the communication of information to the public on food safety and hygiene in the home.</P>
    <P>The national disease surveillance unit, which will have primary responsibility in relation to food-borne diseases, will also maintain a liaison with the authority in this area.</P>
    <P>Much thought has been given to the structure of the authority and the segregation of powers and responsibilities to ensure it can discharge its functions in a fair and balanced way.  This has been achieved by making specific provision in Part III of the Bill for four key, interlocking elements: the board of the authority, its scientific committee, the chief executive and staff, and a consultative council.</P>
    <P>The board of the authority, as detailed in section 31, will consist of ten members, including a chairman, appointed by the Minister for Health and Children.  This body will have overall responsibility for ensuring that the proper food safety systems are in place and it will act as the forum in which the work of the various structural elements are harmonised.  It will thus provide the strategic direction for the authority.</P>
    <P>The chief executive, with the staff, will be responsible for converting this strategy into an operational plan and overseeing its implementation.</P>
    <P>Section 34 provides for a scientific committee, which will have 15 members appointed by the Minister in consultation with the board.  The Minister, in appointing members will have regard to relevant scientific qualifications and experience to ensure the broadest possible range of expertise.</P>
    <P>The scientific committee will advise on matters referred to it by the board pertaining to scientific or technical questions, food inspection and nutrition.  In order to guarantee the science-based nature of the authority the board will await the scientific committee's response before deciding any matter referred.  This scientific committee <Col N="1136" /> may establish sub-committees to undertake further investigation of matters referred to it, and will report back through its chairman, who will also be a member of the board.  The board will be empowered to publish the advice of the scientific committee.  I stress the role of the scientific committee is to assist and advise the board, and such assistance and advice will not be the sole determinant in the board's decisions.</P>
    <P>Food safety is a concern for the community as a whole and the authority will have a duty to ensure it has access to a broad base of views.  In promoting higher standards it will be incumbent on the authority to endeavour to consult the representatives of a wide range of food safety interests.</P>
    <P>In section 14 the Bill provides specifically for a broadly based consultative council.  The Ministers for Health and Children, Agriculture and Food and the Marine and Natural Resources and the board of the authority will nominate the membership of this council.</P>
    <P>However, notwithstanding the fact that the consultative council will include representation from various interests, including producer interests, and that the authority will have regard to the council's views, it will not be bound by these views in arriving at its decisions.  In its deliberations, the board of the authority will see the best interests of the consumer as being paramount, and this notion of the &ldquo;consumer as king&rdquo; will be reflected in the appointment of the board's membership.</P>
    <P>The authority will exercise its powers through its authorised officers who will be empowered to enter and inspect food premises, to secure these premises for later inspection, to inspect and, if necessary, remove records.  These officers may take samples of food or related materials and have these samples analysed, and it will be an offence for any person to obstruct an officer in carrying out this duty.</P>
    <P>Where an authorised officer is of the view that any premises or activity poses a threat to public health, he or she will have the power to dictate the remedial action required and set a time limit for its completion.  These so-called &ldquo;improvement notices&rdquo;, referred to in section 52, are a new feature. While in the past officers could advise on the required improvements to premises or equipment, such advice did not have a statutory basis. Improvement notices, therefore, give food safety professionals in the field a new statutory tool which can be used where there is clear need for some remedial action, but where a complete shutdown of operations may not be warranted.  Where an improvement notice is not complied with, the officer may seek an order from the District Court to force compliance.</P>
    <P>In more serious cases, where, as provided for in section 53, the officer believes there is an immediate and grave threat to public health, a closure order may be made, which will require operations to cease until the problem has been remedied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Situations may also arise where improvements notices or closure are not sufficient.  For example, unsafe products or product batches may have been distributed by the producer and be on the market.  In such cases authorised officers may insist on the withdrawal, recall, detention and supervised destruction of products posing a threat to public health, as provided for in section 54.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that prosecutions may be taken by the authority itself or by one of the contracting agencies, and the provisions contained in existing food legislation shall continue to apply.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Bill there is a strong emphasis on the openness and transparency under which the authority will operate.  As provided for in sections 41 and 42 of the Bill, the chief executive, members of the board, of the scientific committee and its sub-committees, the staff of the authority and any consultants, advisers or other persons engaged by the authority are all required to declare any financial or other beneficial interest that might be in conflict with their role within the authority.</P>
    <P>Accountability measures are found elsewhere in the Bill and I have already referred to the publication of the service contracts.  The authority's accounts will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and laid before the Oireachtas. The chief executive will be the accounting officer and may be called to give evidence to the appropriate Dáil Committee.</P>
    <P>Under section 25, the authority must prepare an annual report of its activities which will also be made available to the Oireachtas.  The Bill also provides for the preparation and submission of other reports by the authority as the need arises. The authority will have a broad remit in the area of research.  Section 18 provides that the authority may undertake, commission or collaborate in research projects and activities on issues relating to food both in Ireland and abroad.</P>
    <P>The sweeping changes proposed in this legislation mirror the change in direction taking place at EU level.</P>
    <P>A new Directorate-General (DG XXIV) has been established within the European Commission with responsibility for consumer policy and consumer health protection.  From now on, responsibility for food inspection and control as well as all the relevant scientific committees that advise on the various scientific aspects of food, will be placed under the authority of the Commissioner for consumer policy and consumer health protection, Ms Emma Bonino.</P>
    <P>The Commission's control function for the entire European Union is now exercised through the Food and Veterinary Office based in County Meath.  Its main function is the monitoring of the observance of food hygiene, which is defined in EU legislation as &ldquo;all measures necessary to ensure the safety and wholesomeness of foodstuffs&rdquo;. A new unit on the assessment of consumer health risks has also been established within DG XXIV.</P>
    <P>Other EU member states are also taking steps <Col N="1138" /> to establish independent food safety bodies on the lines of the authority proposed by the Government.  Ireland is among the first EU countries to have such an authority, reflecting the importance the Government attaches to the whole issue of food safety.</P>
    <P>Ireland enjoys a good reputation for the quality of the food it produces for the domestic and export markets.  Similarly, food imported to Ireland is rigorously monitored by way of bilateral and multi-lateral networks with other countries. We owe a considerable debt to our existing food control agencies for their work over many years to ensure the food we eat is safe.  We cannot afford to be complacent and we need new structures to face the challenges which lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill will provide the framework for the future control and regulation of food safety in Ireland.  We can be proud of the fact that we are far ahead of other countries in this regard, and that these other countries see our proposals as a very useful model.  This Bill will, I firmly believe, provide the reassurance that consumers seek in the important area of food safety and I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has been taken on board by the Minister.  The Minister's presence in the House shows the significance of the legislation and, I hope, the seriousness of the Government response to the problem.</P>
      <P>We are all familiar with the saying, &ldquo;we are what we eat&rdquo;, and food safety, food processing and food production have taken on a greater significance in recent years.  Food safety has become a media issue over the past number of years.  The modern consumer, who now has greater access to a wider range of foodstuffs than heretofore and who has a greater knowledge of the importance of food safety, now demands the highest possible standards.  This has arisen because of the food safety scares which have dominated the media on many occasions over the past number of years. That has been the case not just in Ireland but throughout the EU and indeed world-wide.  In Britain some years ago, the issue of salmonella poisoning generated much political debate, created problems for the then British Government and, if my memory is correct, resulted in the resignation of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest degree of public concern and media interest in relation to food safety here was <Col N="1139" /> generated at the time of the BSE crisis in 1996. That crisis brought beef consumption almost to a standstill and gave a sharp reminder to the consumer that food safety was a major health issue. It also brought about a new relationship between the producer and the consumer, put the idea firmly in place that the consumer was king and put the question of food safety legislation on the front pages of our national newspapers.  It was no surprise, therefore, that the previous Government and the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, were obliged to fully examine all the appropriate measures then in place to secure the health of the consumer and, if necessary, to devise new policies and strategies to continue and develop protection for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Any examination of the position that obtained during the term of office of Deputy Noonan, and which continues to exist, would clearly show that there is no shortage of rules, regulations or EU law to maintain and develop food safety and consumer protection.  That is obvious from the First Schedule and the enormous amount of legislation to which it pertains.  Dozens of such laws and regulations are currently enacted and new regulations frequently come on stream from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The issue which needs to be addressed is the enforcement of these laws and regulations.  The question we must ask during this debate, and particularly on Committee Stage, is whether we are doing enough to operate and enforce all the regulations that were put in place heretofore. When the Abattoirs Bill was passed some years ago, Cork County Council responded immediately and put in place the necessary measures to secure the operation of that legislation, but that was not the case in numerous other counties.  The law was enacted, the rules were due to be enforced but we apparently did not have the powers to do so.  The key to securing the maximum protection for the consumer of foodstuffs is the implementation of all our existing legislation.  We do not need more laws but full observation of our current laws.</P>
    <P>The prime motivation of the proposed Food Safety Authority should be the monitoring and regulation of our current laws, any new laws we may set or those we may take on board from the European Union.  The best interests of the consumer, the producer, the taxpayer and all those who work in the area of food safety regulations would be served by having a clear and simple type of food safety authority.  Unfortunately, the Ministers, in their efforts to be different from their predecessors and in their desire to put a new frame on a picture painted by the previous rainbow Government, may have got it wrong on all counts.  This error could have adverse effects on the health of the consumer and the taxpayer and that is an issue we should address in this debate and on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In November 1996, the then rainbow Government appointed an interim Food Safety Authority. That authority was placed on a non-statutory <Col N="1140" /> basis and the Government commenced work on drafting a Bill to put this interim authority on a statutory footing.  It is my understanding that at the time of leaving office, the rainbow Government had agreed a final drafting of the Bill.  Minister Cowen referred to the delay by the previous Government in having that Bill published, but I remind him that the final draft was available almost 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The emphasis of that proposed Bill was to establish the authority as a regulator of regulators thus ensuring that while responsibility for food control would remain with the many existing agencies, these agencies would be strongly monitored and audited by the authority.  That authority would also have had a direct role in setting and maintaining the highest standards of food production and processing, in the general area of maintaining high standards and the promotion of good practice.</P>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, gave the highest political priority to this legislation as could be seen in the progress made from the summer of 1996, when the BSE crisis was at its height and public concern at its greatest, to November 1996 when the interim Food Safety Authority was in place.</P>
    <P>Government policy at that time was not made up overnight.  A crisis existed, there was genuine fear among consumers and there was a need to respond to that fear.  Policy at that time was not a panic response to the ever increasing concerns of the consumer.  By March 1996 the then Government had already decided that a high level committee, representative of all the relevant Departments, should be established to review the efficiency of the arrangements in place for the control and supervision of the food production chain.  The main task assigned to the group by the rainbow Government was to establish clear and undisputed responsibility for food safety.  The group was obliged to review existing arrangements, identify any problems with those arrangements and, most importantly, suggest any necessary organisational or legislative improvements which might be required.</P>
    <P>It was no surprise that the group eventually concluded that to ensure the maximum protection and assurance for the consumer it would be necessary to establish some type of new statutory body to regulate and promote food safety.  The option in 1996, as is the case now, was to either establish a new body which would assume the functions of the existing food control bodies or, alternatively, establish a body with the primary role of food safety and which would, for this purpose, supervise and co-ordinate the control activities being carried out by the many existing bodies. The then Government very wisely decided to go down the route of providing a co-ordinating body, which became known as the regulator of regulators. The advantage of this proposal was that it would provide a second tier of inspection to supervise those agencies already involved in <Col N="1141" /> inspection, monitoring and supervision of the food chain.  It would primarily have a supervisory role in relation to inspections carried out by other bodies.  It would avoid the duplication of inspectoral activity and, more importantly, offer the major advantage that the required improvements could be put in place without any major change in the operation of the existing control operations, most of which have operated very successfully over the years.  It was against this very sound policy backdrop that the interim Food Safety Authority was established and draft legislation prepared.</P>
    <P>However, Irish political practice seems to oblige Opposition parties always to oppose and propose to amend Government legislation or initiatives, regardless of their worth &mdash; the Minister is probably about to ask whether that is what I am doing.  It was, therefore, no surprise that the response of the Fianna Fáil Opposition, which was admittedly very active and brought out a new official policy almost every week, to the Government initiatives in 1996 and 1997 was to criticise the rainbow proposals as inadequate and to promise to put in place a different system.</P>
    <P>That promised different system, which is in a sense part of the Government's proposals, was an all powerful US-style food and drugs agency directly accountable and responsible for all food control functions.  This commitment became the policy of Fianna Fáil and was eventually written into the Government's programme.  It has led to the unfortunate situation where we are now debating a proposed food safety authority which does not really have the means or will to be what it is supposed to be.  We know from where the proposed food safety legislation is coming, but it is very difficult to know where it is going from reading through the Minister's proposals and the Bill and from listening to what he said today.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for food safety, have held office for almost 12 months and had available to them a final draft of the legislation proposed by the outgoing Government.  To what useful purpose has this year long delay been put? Regrettably, the Minister has wasted 12 months trying to put a Fianna Fáil-PD stamp on a rainbow Bill.  The net cost of the delay has not been simply a failure to provide maximum protection to the consumer; we have also lost a very detailed, pragmatic and practical food safety authority proposal and replaced it with a bureaucratic mess which, upon closer examination, appears to be the toothless tiger which the Minister, Deputy Cowen, described the previous proposal as being.</P>
    <P>I hope to show that the Minister's food safety authority has become an emperor with no clothes. Unfortunately, however, it is an emperor which will cause doubt and difficulty for all those personnel and agencies working in the food safety area.  It will place an unnecessary layer of red tape <Col N="1142" /> between the consumer and those whose duty it is to protect consumers.</P>
    <P>New legislation and proposals for new authorities should inevitably bring about great change.  However, when we examine in any great detail this legislation we must ask what change it proposes.  There are no proposals to introduce any new food safety laws or regulations or to employ any extra staff on food inspectorate duties.  The Bill will simply result in the same tasks being carried out by the same personnel under the previous legislation.  Provision, admittedly, is made for aspirational moves to a super agency which could eventually employ the 2,000 plus staff who work for the various agencies. However, it has already been conceded that this aspiration is nothing more than a possibility.  Life is a permanency of possibilities and it is more probable than possible that the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The aspect of the Bill which requires the most thorough analysis relates to the service contracts in section 48.  These service contracts have become the Government's opt-out clause.  The putting in places of these service contracts is a total admission that Government policy in this area is purely aspirational, nothing but a list of endless possibilities, a result of irresponsible and negative opposition to the previous Government's proposals and a very late and final effort to get itself off the hook on which it has impaled itself.  That sums up what is behind section 48.  We must thoroughly scrutinise the concept of service contracts, particularly on Committee Stage, as it is obvious that enormous problems may occur.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, over 2,000 personnel in a wide variety of Government agencies and Departments, such as the Departments of Agriculture and Food, the Environment and Local Government, and Health and Children, are responsible for food safety in its various guises. Section 48, which deals with service contracts, states the authority &ldquo;may for the purpose of carrying out its functions&rdquo; enter into such service contracts.  We then learn, on reading the Bill and the explanatory memorandum, that these service contracts will inevitably be offered to the official agency responsible at present for the enforcement of the standards set down in the various pieces of food legislation.</P>
    <P>The fact that service contracts can only be offered to those official agencies previously responsible for the appropriate area of food safety is surely the clearest possible proof that nothing has changed except the Government. There are no new rules, regulations, policies, assurances on food safety or consumer protection &mdash; just a new Minister.  Does the Minister recognise the bureaucratic roundabout proposed in the legislation as the political alternative to the much more direct route policy of the previous Administration?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise the effect of telling over 2,000 staff that they may some day be removed from their present contract of employment <Col N="1143" /> and transferred to the Minister's food safety authority?  What level of discussion has he had with union officials on this matter?  Is he prepared to tell us now if and when this huge change of staff might occur?  Is he prepared to state clearly that it is the intent and the will of the Government to bring this change about during its term of office?  It is convenient, given the present political climate, that the service contracts will last for three or four years.  I trust service contracts will continue to be the norm as this legislation intends.  We need to know whether the Minister intends to change staff from the existing agencies to the FSA during the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <P>The more one examines section 48 and the issue of service contracts, which go to the core of the Minister's philosophy, the more one must conclude they are very flawed, perhaps fatally so. We are told the authority shall specify to the agencies the objectives, targets, timeframes etc. which will comprise their job descriptions. However, is it not true that these objectives, targets and timeframes are those under which the present agencies already operate?</P>
    <P>The Minister has given no indication of any new food safety legislation or regulations and there is no mention of the power of the SFA to initiate or demand such legislation.  The reality of his proposal is that the same work will be done under the same law by the same people.  They may be called service contractors but they will provide the same services as heretofore.</P>
    <P>This ridiculous new layer of bureaucracy and red tape will result in the food safety authority asking questions to which it already knows the answers and the official agencies, such as health boards, veterinary departments and agriculture officers, meeting targets and objectives in the same way they are doing at present.  It would be laughable if it were not such a costly and bureaucratic policy of confusion and illusion.</P>
    <P>I am interested in section 48(12), which deals with the obligation of the authority to deal with situations where contracts are not being met in full.  The Bill states that in such circumstances the authority, following consultations with the Minister's office, shall without delay &ldquo;put in place such arrangements as it considers necessary for the performance of the subject matter of the service contract in question&rdquo;.  What does this really mean?  Does it mean that if the food safety authority in the Munster area is unhappy with the work of the inspectorate staff of the Southern Health Board, it can terminate the service contract and have the relevant duties and responsibilities carried out by other health board staff? Does it mean extra resources would then be made available to an alternative agency to allow the carrying out of those duties?  Where would these resources come from?</P>

    <Title>An Bille um Binsí Fiosrúcháin (Fianaise) (Leasú), (Uimh. 2), 1998   Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1998</Title>
    <P>AN ACT TO AMEND THE TRIBUNALS OF INQUIRY (EVIDENCE) ACTS, 1921 TO 1998.</P>
    <P>BE IT ENACTED BY THE OIREACHTAS AS FOLLOWS:</P>
    <P>1.  Section 1A of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, (inserted by section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998) is hereby amended by the substitution of the following for subsection (1):</P>
    <P>(1) An instrument to which this section applies (whether made before or after the passing of the <i>Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998</i>, shall be amended, pursuant to a Resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, by a Minister of the Government, unless the tribunal informs the Chairmen of both such Houses that it is satisfied that such amendment would prejudice the rights of a person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its then existing terms of reference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>2.  (1) This Act may be cited as the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>(2) The collective citation the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998 shall include this Act and those and this Act shall be construed together as one.</P>
    <P>It was never normal for Ministers to be handed £43,000 in two donations to keep for their own use in their homes during an election campaign. I do not believe that any of the other Ministers appointed by the Taoiseach have ever had any such experience.  What happened was exceptional; it was an aberration.  It is because it was an aberration that I do not believe there is any <Col N="1146" /> acceptable explanation for the fact that the Taoiseach did nothing last March when he heard that it was £43,000, not £13,000, that his long time colleague, Ray Burke, had received by way of donations in his home in 1989 and which he kept for his own use.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Taoiseach did nothing last March leads one to believe that, at some level in his mind, he believed it was all right for Ray Burke to get and keep £43,000 and that he, as</P>
    <P>Taoiseach and leader of Fianna Fáil, had no responsibility to do anything about it when he apparently heard about it for the first time last March.  If the Taoiseach wanted, as he said last October, to dispel the poisonous innuendo that hangs over our political life, he would not have kept that information from the public, the tribunal, the Tánaiste, other Ministers and the Dáil when he first heard about it last March.  His credibility is fatally weakened.</P>
    <P>The assertions made last night on the RTE radio programme &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; and in today's newspapers are of the utmost gravity for the Taoiseach.  They show he was wrong on several counts when he told the House last week about the Fizwilton payment to Mr. Burke.  First, it has now emerged that it was Mr. Byrne of Rennicks who told Fianna Fáil about the £30,000 payment to Mr. Burke and that the £30,000 was not something Fianna Fáil's internal detectives had discovered.  Second, Mr. Byrne never said the company gave &ldquo;no money&rdquo;, as the Taoiseach tried to tell the Dáil last week. Third, the Taoiseach misled a wider audience when he told the nation on television on Friday that he had instructed an official to &ldquo;make sure the tribunal get everything&rdquo;.  It has now emerged that Fianna Fáil did not tell the tribunal everything. It did not tell the tribunal that Mr. Burke had got £30,000 from Fitzwilton and not just £10,000.</P>
    <P>Were the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, and the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resource, Deputy Woods, who appeared on the media over the weekend to defend the Government, ever told that their party had only disclosed £10,000, not £30,000 to the tribunal? I believe the Taoiseach also kept them in the dark about the facts, but perhaps they can deny that.</P>
    <P>The impression was systematically created by Fianna Fáil that everything had been given to the tribunal.  Now, in a change of tack, the Taoiseach's anonymous spokespeople are telling us he was legally advised last March not to disclose the extra £20,000 from Fitzwilton because they had not been asked about it by the planning tribunal. How could the tribunal ask about it when it had not been told about it?  If Fianna Fáil believed the £20,000 was outside the planning tribunal's legal remit, who did the Taoiseach think would then investigate the £20,000 Fitzwilton money pocketed by Ray Burke?  Did he think it was not worthy of any investigation?  Did he think it was acceptable for a serving Minister to pocket a <Col N="1147" /> donation of that size?  If not, why did he not initiate an investigation last March?</P>
    <P>We are told that tribunals can ask to have their terms of reference extended.  How was the Flood tribunal supposed to decide whether it should seek an amendment to its terms of reference to include the extra £20,000 Fitzwilton donation to Mr. Burke if Fianna Fáil refused to tell the tribunal that an extra £20,000 had been paid to Mr. Burke?  This obfuscation by the Taoiseach cannot be explained by lack of preparation for unexpected questions or by a breakdown of communication between Fianna Fáil staff and him.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has known about the full £30,000 paid to Mr. Burke since last March.  He has had two and a half months to prepare his story.  If any misstatements transpire to have been made in the past week after that amount of time to prepare, these misstatements by the Taoiseach would have to have been deliberate and calculated. I can think of no more appropriate day than 1 April &mdash; April Fools' Day &mdash; for Fianna Fáil to send its affidavit to the tribunal &mdash; the April Fools' affidavit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's decision not to tell the tribunal about the £20,000 retained by Ray Burke raises serious questions.  What special hold has Ray Burke over his loyalty?  He appointed Mr. Burke to Government last June when dark clouds were already gathering over Mr. Burke's head.  While the Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, asked a direct question of Mr. Murphy in London, the Taoiseach has had to admit that he had asked no matching direct question about the JMSE donation of Mr. Burke in Dublin last June.  Why was he afraid to ask Mr. Burke?</P>
    <P>Last March the Taoiseach concealed from the tribunal the information that Mr. Burke had got a total of £30,000, not £10,000, from Rennicks. Why did he not tell the tribunal all he knew then? He had strong evidence to offer the tribunal about Mr. Burke but he chose to hold it back. Why?  Is there something that Mr. Burke might say or do that is of such concern to him that he has to show Mr. Burke he will only do what he is forced into doing?</P>
    <P>There are four key questions at the heart of this motion which require immediate answers. They are also at the heart of the nature of good Government.  The first concerns the responsibility of any parliamentarian, especially a Taoiseach, to come before the House to correct any misleading information he or she may have placed on its record.  The Taoiseach did not do so when he spoke last week.  He has compounded this by last night's revelations of what now look like deliberate misstatements.</P>
    <P>The second question concerns the responsibility of any head of Government to be open and honest with his Tánaiste.  This means sharing information and trusting a ministerial colleague. The Taoiseach did not do this.  He has now twice concealed information from the Tánaiste.  Is he <Col N="1148" /> playing a psychological game to test out how far he can demean his partners in Government before their nerve breaks?</P>
    <P>The third question deals with the farcical nature of the so-called investigation into the allegations that surrounded Mr. Burke before he was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs last June. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Social, Family and Community Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, are at odds about what this investigation involved.  In his speech last Wednesday, the Taoiseach said that Mr. Ahern was examining the array of allegations about Mr. Burke when he went to London.  Later that evening the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was at pains to point out that he was not examining an array of anything, but merely asking one man one question about one donation.  I believe him.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had acted promptly and properly when he received the information about the Rennicks £30,000 donation last March, this debate could have been avoided, the Taoiseach would have been congratulated on his businesslike approach and there would have been no more than a short debate authorising the necessary inquiries.  None of the questions asked last week would have been necessary.  They would have been asked and answered by the inquiry which would have been established as soon as the Taoiseach asked that this be done.  If <i>Magill</i> had not publicised the matter, the Taoiseach would never have told the Tánaiste or this House and would never have ordered any of the inquiries now taking place.  If the Vincent Browne radio show and today's newspapers had not run the new allegations, the Taoiseach would have furthered his concealment tonight.</P>
    <P>Like a small boy caught robbing an orchard, the Taoiseach's reaction was a mixture of petrification and denial.  Last Wednesday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago the people, North and South, endorsed the finest achievement of politics and politicians in a generation, the British-Irish Agreement.  Politics and politicians could hold their heads up high.  Last week we were thrown back into the pit of distrust and deceit. This week it has become worse.  We have been placed there by the Taoiseach and the Government. They have no one to blame and nowhere to hide.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has fundamentally failed in his duty to the House, his Government partners, the profession he practises and the people.  There are three issues of trust on which he has been found wanting.  He allowed a misleading statement to the House given by the former Minister, Ray Burke, on 10 September last to go uncorrected despite knowing for at least two months that it was false.  He and his party denied information to the Flood tribunal that Mr. Burke had received £30,000, not £10,000, from Rennicks despite being explicitly informed of this by that company's accountant before the affidavit was lodged. Fianna Fáil has sought to defend its duplicity by suggesting it was acting on legal advice.  What was the nature of that advice?  Was it verbal or written and does the Taoiseach intend to publish it?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's disregard for this House and the tribunal extended to his Government partners. He revealed last week that he had concealed the information from the Tánaiste, his so-called Government partner &mdash; so much for partnership Government.  The Tánaiste is now shouting stop but it is too late.  I remind her of the words of her former colleague, Michael McDowell, writing in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> after the last election: &ldquo;A party that does not stand for anything will stand for anything&rdquo;.  Speaking in the debate on the establishment of the McCracken tribunal last September the Tánaiste said:</P>
      <P>We must rescue Irish political life from the ravages of understandable cynicism.  We must be able to demonstrate that those who serve in public life are honourable.  The people of this Republic deserve no less and they must get it.</P>
      <P>Does she believe the Taoiseach has lived up to her expectations in the last two months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was not content to abuse the trust of this House, his Government partners and the tribunals of inquiry.  In defending himself in this House last week he maligned a private citizen simply because it was he who confirmed to Fianna Fáil that Rennicks had given Ray Burke a cheque for £30,000, not £10,000.  Yesterday Mr. David Byrne wrote to the Taoiseach requesting <Col N="1150" /> a correction of the record.  Why has it not been forthcoming?  Time prevents me from reading all the letter but I will read the relevant section:</P>
    <P>I met Mr. Richardson and at all times I told him that the figure was £30,000 and I never never denied the fact.  Indeed, I gave him a copy of the anonymous letter for his files.  If one were to assume that Fianna Fáil and Mr. Richardson were not aware of the £30,000 when Mr. Richardson made contact with me, I consider that I was the person to alert Fianna Fáil to this payment of £30,000. The Taoiseach has a duty to correct the record and restore Mr. Byrne's good name and reputation.</P>
    <P>It is my view and that of my party that decisions made by Ray Burke in Government must be subject to examination by an independent tribunal.  There is a cloud over the decisions taken by the Government which included Deputies Mary O'Rourke, Séamus Brennan, Michael Woods, Dessie O'Malley and Bobby Molloy as well as the Taoiseach, a Government for whom only Ray Burke was deemed capable of handling the Communications portfolio.</P>
    <P>The issuing of MMDS licences by Mr. Burke must be subject to scrutiny.  Much has been written about this subject in the past few days.  A few facts need repeating.  It was improper for Mr. Burke to receive money from a company with a connection to another with which he was then dealing in relation to the issuing of State backed licences.  What we already know about Mr. Burke's <i>modus operandi</i> and reports in the weekend's newspapers as to the amount of money in his &ldquo;political account&rdquo; indicate that any decision taken by him in Government is now open to question.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are now on record that such an examination should take place, a fact seemingly overlooked by the Independent group of newspapers which has concentrated its considerable fire-power elsewhere, but how is this examination to be done?  In a complete and total climb-down the Bill published today is the first recognition by the Government of the right of the Oireachtas to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal.  It represents a negation of every argument employed by the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Attorney General since the Labour Party first tried to have the Ansbacher accounts included in the terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that at a Government meeting on or about Tuesday, 10 March the Government had before it a memorandum from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which contained two proposals for amending the tribunals Act, one a broad option which retained the initiative with the Houses of the Oireachtas and the other a narrow option which required the chairperson to request the change.  The Taoiseach and the Government consciously <Col N="1151" /> and deliberately chose the narrowest possible option and only belatedly are they coming to realise the utter folly of this choice.</P>
    <P>The sheer cynicism of that Government decision was forcefully pointed out by Deputy Upton in this House and Senator O'Meara in the Seanad.  Their stand in pressing amendments is utterly vindicated by the complete U-turn engaged in by the Government here today, just two months after the first amending Bill was enacted by these Houses.</P>
    <P>In every possible respect the Government's Bill is inferior legislation from that which I moved on behalf of the Opposition earlier today.  In particular, I am concerned the Government's Bill may require the prior approval of the tribunal to an amendment to its terms of reference proposed by the Oireachtas.  In addition, it retains the procedure whereby the Attorney General will have a role in unilateral consultations with tribunal chairpersons, a procedure which does not allow a role to the Opposition.  For those reasons we will oppose the Bill on Second Stage and, if passed, will seek to amend it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that in replies from chairpersons of tribunals to letters I sent to them, which were published today, they do not appear to be keen to see their respective terms of reference amended.  It is clear, to use the phrase employed by Ray Burke that, &ldquo;the Government is trying to draw a line in the sand&rdquo; under its lamentable performance on this issue over the past year.  I hope for the Government's sake, and for the sake of politics, that the line in the sand is more substantive than its immediate forerunner.</P>

      <P>There are two major issues involved in this debate, the motivation for and the implications of the Taoiseach giving this House material information that was untrue and the frenetic four day campaign by Independent Newspapers to defend the economic interests of their proprietor.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach misled the House on 8 October in respect of the origins of the £10,000 remitted to Fianna Fáil by Ray Burke in June 1989.  We do not know it was inadvertent, but given that the office of Taoiseach is involved, it is proper there should be a presumption it was inadvertent until the contrary is proven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Thursday the Taoiseach sought to explain it by taking shelter behind the Flood tribunal to explain why he acquiesced and participated in the promotion of the wrong view that the £10,000 was Gogarty-JMSE money.  It was also his defence as to why he did not tell the Tánaiste in March when he claims he first discovered that the £10,000 in question came from the Fitzwilton subsidiary, Rennicks.  We still do not know whether he told the Tánaiste about the £20,000 retained by Mr. Burke.  He said, &ldquo;an official came into my office to tell me this and I told them to make sure the tribunal gets everything.&rdquo;.  We know now that the tribunal did not get everything.  Although he <Col N="1152" /> knew Rennicks executives had confirmed they gave £30,000 to Fianna Fáil though Ray Burke, the affidavit to the tribunal made no mention of the £20,000 which Ray Burke had retained. Amazingly the Taoiseach told the House on Thursday, &ldquo;A Mr. David Byrne on behalf of the company made contact to say that he had given no money at all, under any circumstances.&rdquo;. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, repeated a version of this denial on Thursday night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme with Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>We now believe the same Mr. David Byrne has written to the Taoiseach reminding him that not only is the Taoiseach's version not true, but that Mr. Byrne asserted that £30,000 had been given to Ray Burke and that Fianna Fáil &ldquo;must have been left shy of £20,000&rdquo; and demanding that the record be put right.  It is difficult to see how &ldquo;inadvertent&rdquo; can be tagged on to this latest contradiction.</P>
    <P>Contradiction has now been piled on contradiction and the question is why?  Why did the Taoiseach claim to have been up every tree in North Dublin &mdash; where, apparently, it is a fact there are trees &mdash; as part of his upside down inside out investigation of Ray Burke's suitability for Cabinet office when he knew no investigation worthy of the name took place?  Why did he tell the House as recently as last Thursday that Minister Dermot Ahern travelled to London &ldquo;to examine the array of allegations&rdquo; made about Ray Burke and &ldquo;whether he had received a donation from JMSE or others and the amount involved&rdquo; when Minister Dermot Ahern said his mission was to go to London to ask Mr. Murphy one question and that was the extent of his mandate?  Why did Minister Dermot Ahern, acquiesce in the Steve Silvermint role until, subjected to ridicule in the House last Thursday, he decided on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; to drop his leader in it?</P>
    <P>There never was an investigation by the Leader of Fianna Fáil into allegations that, if established, would have precluded the appointment of Ray Burke to Cabinet, but there was a carefully contrived public relations exercise designed to mollify the malleable Progressive Democrats and to facilitate the Cabinet appointment of Ray Burke. At least one prospective member of Cabinet, Minister Dermot Ahern, knew it was a sham and the remainder of the Cabinet, including the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, either knew it was a sham or were duped.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has not explained why, if Deputy Spring put him in possession of the information in the anonymous note from Rennicks, he subsequently acquiesced in the Burke version of events?  Perhaps it is possible that a casual encounter with Deputy Spring may have slipped his mind, but why did he acquiesce in the statement from Fianna Fáil headquarters confirming Ray Burke's version of the £10,000?  That statement was unlikely to have been issued without the Taoiseach's knowledge and approval, given what was at stake.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said on Thursday last that he <Col N="1153" />&ldquo;was told in early February that we would receive orders from the tribunal with which we would have to comply&rdquo;.  Therefore, he knew what would be required of his party.  He went on, inside and outside the House, to underline several times how his party gave full co-operation to the tribunal. For example, he said, &ldquo;as soon as I got all the details, I gave them to the tribunal&rdquo;.  We know now that for whatever reason the tribunal did not get all the details.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated on another occasion that &ldquo;what matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available&rdquo;.  It is hard to gainsay that, but by his own yardstick he has reacted furtively; he has misled the Dáil, inadvertently or otherwise, and latterly given the Dáil information he knew to be incorrect.  These are serious matters for any holder of the office of Taoiseach, but are more serious in the context of his failure to take seriously the allegations in the public domain against someone to whom he proposed to give a Cabinet office.  This failure has since been compounded by his refusal, until the <i>Magill</i> story was published, to investigate any of the public policy decisions taken by Mr Burke as Minister that might have been influenced by the personal receipt of such a large amount of money.</P>
    <P>Given the Taoiseach's failure to initiate inquiries into these issues, it fell to the Opposition to raise the pertinent questions.  In particular, Deputy John Bruton drew attention to the possible conflict of interest in Mr Burke's acceptance of a large donation from a sister company of Princes Holdings to whom Mr Burke, as Minister, had awarded the lion's share of the MMDS licences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton pointed to the unusual circumstances in which the letter of February 1991 was written to Mr Joe Hayes, then managing director of Independent Newspapers; to the far reaching nature of the private assurances given &ldquo;without bothering to survey, identify and exempt areas where it was physically impossible for Princes Holdings to provide any TV service&rdquo; and he queried whether Mr. Burke had been influenced by the donation received two years earlier.  In that regard it is interesting to note that the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, has since gone on local radio in Waterford to advocate that the local deflector company be licensed.</P>
    <P>Nobody in this House could have anticipated the fevered response of Independent Newspapers to this reasonable questioning.  The fact that Deputy Bruton prefaced his remarks by observing that Dr. Tony O'Reilly is &ldquo;an immensely successful businessman&rdquo; who has &ldquo;created jobs and wealth in Ireland which all Governments acknowledged&rdquo; did nothing to stem the vituperative tide. &ldquo;Lying letters, phantom meetings and calculated smears&rdquo; screamed yet another front page editorial in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> As the tirade continued, one conclusion is inescapable: if ever there was a doubt about the undesirability of a dominant position in such a sensitive industry <Col N="1154" /> then the conduct of Independent Newspapers over the weekend removed that doubt.</P>
    <P>Journalists and columnists were used in such an overkill to defend the economic interests of their proprietor that the public were given a glimpse of what abuse of dominant position means in practice. On a weekend radio programme a prominent senior counsel, not unconnected with Independent Newspapers, if disconnected from any party in this House now, first disputed whether the group had a dominant position and then conceded that perhaps it has what he called &ldquo;a slightly dominant position&rdquo;.  In fact, of the papers published in Ireland the Independent Group has 66 per cent of the daily and evening papers; 95 per cent of the Sunday papers, prior to the advent of <i>Ireland on Sunday</i>, and ten regional newspapers from Dundalk to Wexford to Kerry.</P>
    <P>No matter how many hired hands are rounded up to defend the citadel, including today's appearance by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to sing for his supper, those figures represent a blatantly dominant position.</P>

      <P>I wish to take this opportunity to ask the <i>Irish Independent</i> if it is true that last Saturday it pulled a mildly critical piece by its regular columnist, Bruce Arnold?  If the one dimensional fever had reached such a pitch at Independent House that a piece by a regular columnist with the track record of Bruce Arnold was censored, then those of us who hold a different view of the world from him know what to expect.  I never believed that such deliberate censorship took place.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Why can Tony O'Reilly, as chairman of Fitzwilton, not make a statement setting out his point of view?  For example, in favour of the <i>Irish Independent</i> case, it is true that at a meeting on local radio organised by Senator Séamus Cullimore between Mr. Burke as the Minister for Communications, Mr. Ray Doyle, managing director of <i>People</i> Newspapers and Mr. Dermot Walshe, then editor of the <i>Wexford People</i>, it was Mr. Burke who introduced Mr. Doyle and Mr. Walshe to the MMDS possibilities.  Despite having been warned about the appearance of newspaper <Col N="1155" /> advertisements which were inaccessible to ordinary people, the Independent Group missed the deadline, was specially exempted and subsequently received the lion's share of the MMDS licences through Princes Holdings.  This happened in late 1987/early 1988.</P>
    <P>We need to know from the chairman of Fitzwilton the payments since 1987 made to political parties and politicians.  After all, Mr. O'Reilly told <i>Forbes</i> magazine that because he owned 35 per cent of the newspapers in Ireland &mdash; he owns a larger percentage now &mdash; he was close to politicians so he could get the exploration blocks of his choosing.  We also need to know if it is the case that Mr. O'Reilly made a single exceptionally large contribution to Fianna Fáil in 1994. Plain answers to straight questions would be appreciated rather than another fulminating editorial on the front or back pages.</P>
    <P>At Question Time on 8 October the Taoiseach opined that the &ldquo;unsubstantiated innuendo&rdquo; against Mr. Ray Burke &ldquo;may well fall away&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach appears to have forgotten the McCracken conclusions:</P>
    <P>It is quite unacceptable that a Member of Dáil Éireann, and in particular a Cabinet Minister and Taoiseach, should be supported in his personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally. It is particularly unacceptable that such gifts should emanate from prominent businessmen within the State.  The possibility that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought, is very high, and if such gifts are permissible, they would inevitably lead in some cases to bribery and corruption.</P>

      <P>Under the Taoiseach's leadership, Fianna Fáil has once again become the untouchable in Irish politics.  Last week's speech by the Taoiseach was an exercise in concealment. He deliberately created confusion and clouded the issues.  He misled the House.</P>
      <P>There are glaring contradictions and inconsistencies in what the Taoiseach said in the past and what he told the House last week.  Deputies may recall the Taoiseach's recent appearance on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  He was asked by Mr. Gay Byrne, who is a good and loyal friend of Fianna Fáil, what characteristic made him such an effective politician.  Mr. Byrne asked him if he was highly intelligent.</P>

      <P>It was not a chance meeting.  It involved an eminent politician and the Taoiseach expects the House to believe that he could not recall the meeting.  This is incredible and difficult to accept.  Perhaps on mature reflection the Taoiseach can now state whether he recalls that meeting with Deputy Spring.</P>
      <P>Last week the Taoiseach refused to state unequivocally that Mr. Ray Burke's behaviour was totally unacceptable.  He said, &ldquo;I will not judge him&rdquo;.  However, the Taoiseach judged him when he made him a Minister and he was supported fully by the Tánaiste in that move.  The Progressive Democrats now claim that if they knew then what they know now, they would not have supported Mr. Burke's appointment. However, they continue to support a Taoiseach who continues to support Mr. Burke.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, said on Sunday that he was angry at Mr. Burke's behaviour and he found it unacceptable because it sent out all the wrong signals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not equivocate.  However, the Taoiseach still cannot bring himself to state the obvious, that Mr. Burke's behaviour was wrong.  The Taoiseach was not so hesitant during the Deputy Lowry affair when he stated that if members of his party had accepted large donations from business interests they should resign.  He said we have to maintain the confidence of the public in the integrity of the political system.  Yet, when he discovered that Mr. Burke accepted £30,000 from developers, he did not ask him to resign and he was supported by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach claimed that Mr. Burke was hounded out of office.  However, having discovered that Mr. Burke misled the House and apparently misled Fianna Fáil, he still refused to state categorically that Mr. Burke's behaviour was unacceptable.  This is most disquieting.  The question many people are asking &mdash; Deputy Bruton mentioned this aspect &mdash; is whether Mr. Burke has something on the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach should clarify the exact nature of the relationship.  If he does not do so, Mr. Burke will continue to slowly dig his political grave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public is becoming cynical about tribunals. They are seen as an easy way for lawyers to make large amounts of money but people appear to remain unpunished.  For example, regarding the McCracken case, a file has been with the Director of Public Prosecutions for some time but we have not heard anything about it.  Politicians must be seen to deal with this matter and we can do that in the House.  We can clean up what is perceived <Col N="1158" /> to be the mess in politics.  It is up to us and we must do it.</P>

    <P>BE IT ENACTED by the Oireachtas as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1159" /> 1.  The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, is hereby amended by the substitution for section 1A (amended by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998) of the following section:</P>
    <P>(1) An instrument to which this section applies (whether made before or after the passing of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998) shall be amended, pursuant to a Resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, by a Minister of the Government where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the tribunal consents to the proposed amendment following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister, or</P>
    <P>(b) the tribunal has requested the amendment.</P>
    <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the tribunal shall not consent to or request an amendment where it is satisfied that such amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>(3) Where an instrument to which this section applies is so amended this Act shall apply.</P>
    <P>(4) This section applies, in the case of a tribunal to which this Act is applied under section 1 of this Act, to the instrument by which the tribunal is appointed.</P>
    <P>2.  (1)-This Act may be cited as the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998.</P>
    <P>(2) The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998, and this may be cited together as the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998.</P>
    <P>We all have a duty to protect the integrity of this House and of our democracy.  The Government is just as determined as the Opposition to do that in a fair and balanced manner likely to yield clear results.  Accordingly, we are tabling amending legislation to allow the Houses of the Oireachtas to change the terms of reference of a tribunal with the consent of its chairman.  This is with a view to seeking the consent of Mr. Justice Flood to amend the terms of reference of his tribunal to establish whether any decisions taken by former Deputy Ray Burke as a Minister were prompted or distorted by payments that he had received.  The Attorney General has consulted the two distinguished judges as to whether there would be any obstacle to their terms of reference being amended by the Oireachtas if that should be the wish of the Oireachtas.  It is quite normal and proper for the Attorney General to act as a channel of communication in this way, as his predecessor had to do in connection with <Col N="1160" /> extending the terms of the hepatitis C tribunal. The sole members of both tribunals have indicated their willingness to undertake further investigative work on behalf of the Oireachtas should that be the wish of the Oireachtas.  After careful consideration we have formed the view that further investigations would most appropriately be undertaken by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal, so that matters relating to Mr. Burke are all dealt with by the one tribunal.</P>
    <P>Many arguments, some that are strong and some that have little foundation, have been made about the political donations made to Mr. Burke. It is time to distinguish the wood from the trees.</P>
    <P>The first question I am asked is why I appointed Mr. Burke Minister for Foreign Affairs last June.  Mr. Burke was an experienced and capable Minister, who had participated in an earlier phase of the talks process and in the work of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  As Leader of the Opposition, I had worked very well with him on Northern Ireland and European matters, where his judgment was very good.  He was eminently qualified for the job of Minister for Foreign Affairs.  When we came into office, I remind Deputies that there was no renewed IRA ceasefire and the talks had been stalled and going nowhere for over 12 months.  Even in the short time that he was Minister he made his mark and, working well with the Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam, we had arrived at a situation by the end of September where both the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Féin were sitting around the same table with others within weeks of a new IRA ceasefire. His decision to resign shortly afterwards was sincerely regretted by most of the talks participants.</P>
    <P>To listen to Deputy Bruton and some outside comment, one could be forgiven for thinking that that type of qualification and competence was irrelevant to a ministerial appointment.  That was not my view.  In so far as my experience of Mr. Burke as a ministerial colleague was concerned, he was careful and responsible in his approach to decision-making.  From that perspective he was eminently suited for his job.</P>
    <P>I was aware before appointing him that there was ongoing controversy that sought to connect the acceptance of financial donations by him and decisions on rezoning vast tracts of land in north county Dublin by Dublin County Council.  To call a spade a spade, there were people insinuating that Mr. Burke was corrupt.  Specific allegations varying in detail were made in relation to developers JMSE and Bovale.  I sought to establish whether there was anything in them and made inquiries of my own in relation to this matter over quite a long period prior to the last election with senior people well placed to know.  These included the independent inquiry made by Deputy Dermot Ahern, now Minister for Social Welfare, Community and Family Affairs, on my behalf in London which failed to substantiate the claims being made, or indeed to elicit confirmation of any donation by the company itself. The array of allegations concerned differing <Col N="1161" /> amounts, £30,000, £40,000 and £80,000, alleged to have been made by differing companies or individuals, JMSE, Bovale or Gogarty.  The question was put by Deputy Ahern to Mr. Murphy, who I thought was in the best position to know the answer.  On more than one occasion prior to last June, when I questioned Mr. Burke, I was assured by him that there was nothing troubling him or that he could not stand over.</P>
    <P>I will freely admit with the benefit of hindsight that I seriously underestimated the degree to which this and other controversies would dog the Minister and eventually make it impossible for him to carry on, notwithstanding the good work that he was doing at Stormont.  It is almost forgotten now that the issue which precipitated his final resignation was a newspaper report relating to the issue of a passport under the special investment scheme.  Since then the Government has moved to close down the passports for sale scheme, despite the wish of some Members of the Opposition to retain it.  However, my view and the view of the Government is that political controversies caused by the doubtful ethics and equity of the whole scheme did more damage to this country's good name than is compensated for by the different investments.</P>
    <P>While we have established a planning inquiry which will go into a lot of matters stretching back over many years, I do not know what point the inquiry has reached.  From what is in the public domain we are no further forward on this matter than we were when this matter was debated here last September.  We are not aware if any actual wrongdoing by Mr. Burke in relation to his acceptance of £30,000 from Gogarty or JMSE has been established, but the Flood Tribunal will presumably make a definitive finding on this, having investigated it to a far greater depth than any of the rest of us could do, when its work is complete.</P>
    <P>The size of the single £30,000 donation from JMSE given to Mr. Burke in 1989, once it became public knowledge last September, caused considerable disquiet and unease.  He himself acknowledged that in hindsight it was imprudent of him to have accepted so large a sum, as the motives were likely to be misrepresented.  When he said this was the largest sum he received, it could have been reasonably assumed that there must have been a number of smaller sums, but not that he had accepted a further donation of an equivalent size.</P>
    <P>The argument against acceptance of these kinds of moneys, even if perfectly legal, is one of general principle, with which most if not all of us now agree.  It is that a politician should not put himself or herself under that degree of political and financial obligation to anyone, a point already made in the McCracken tribunal report in relation to Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey. While large financial donations were and are no doubt intended purely as a gesture of good will and support either for the party concerned or for the democratic system, donors probably entertain an expectation that should the need arise they <Col N="1162" /> will at least be guaranteed access to present their case.  That said, I have confidence in my colleagues past and present on all sides of the House that they would reject any attempts at bribing them or to establish any overt <i>quid pro quo</i> or inside track contrary to the principles of good administration and I would be very saddened if it were to be found otherwise in any specific instances.</P>
    <P>Justified criticisms have been made of the system as it applied until recently that the sums allowed to be given to individuals and parties were unlimited, that they did not have to be declared and that they allowed too cosy a relationship between business and politics, sometimes to the detriment of the more general public interest.  That is why in recent years, while being concerned about proper funding of the party system, we have all accepted the need for more stringent rules.  All parties, including Fianna Fáil, operated the same system, and I suggest none of them are entitled, without revealing the larger sums that they or their members accepted, to climb up on the high moral ground.  All of us, including Fianna Fáil, have found ourselves in politically embarrassing situations or controversies from which lessons have had to be learnt. I personally will resist the temptation to go over past controversies affecting other parties and other party leaders, but let only those whose conduct in relation to seeking party financial donations has been above all criticism continue to cast stones.</P>
    <P>It would appear, to put the most charitable interpretation on it, that Mr. Burke was embarrassingly good at political fund-raising and at building up a large personal political war chest. Only a certain portion of what he was able to raise or of what was given to him was remitted, it would appear, to party headquarters.  I discovered in late March that in 1989 he was given another election contribution of £30,000 from Rennicks. Like most members of the party, I am surprised and disappointed at the picture which is now emerging.  I deeply regret that Mr. Burke was not more open and frank with his colleagues and with this House about the extent of the difficulties he needed to address.  It seems to me as a general principle that those who have enjoyed the trust and support of ordinary party members, of the electorate and of this House, and who have achieved high office and positions of great trust over a number of years, owe a full and frank explanation to the country that should not have to be extracted from them by tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    <P>There have been attempts, so far unsubstantiated, to link the Rennicks contribution to decisions made by Mr. Burke as Minister.  There are demands that Mr. Burke's decisions should be investigated and trawled through to see whether, because of the large sums involved, he was influenced by financial considerations in his political decision-making, whether on IDA grants, MMDS or anything else.  There is to date no hard evidence for any of that.  Any questions raised by <Col N="1163" /> material available so far, on a preliminary trawl of files, will be for the tribunal, assuming that it takes on the task, to investigate.  They will establish if there is a cause for serious concern in relation to the distortion of specific decisions.  I will not prejudge that process.  That is the appropriate forum where every individual concerned has a right to a hearing to vindicate their good name.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will have full Government and departmental co-operation in its inquiries.  This Government, unlike some of its predecessors, will ensure that the direct sale of any State assets or franchises of any substantial consequence will be the subject of full Government decisions, which may not always have been the case in the past, and this applies of course to the telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked as to why I was not aware earlier of the Rennicks contribution to Ray Burke in 1989.  Ray Burke informed the Dáil that he gave £10,000 to party headquarters and £7,000 to his constituency organisation without explicitly specifying the source, leaving it to be assumed that this was principally from moneys which had been donated to him by Gogarty or JMSE.  Party headquarters confirmed that it had been paid £10,000, which was all that concerned me at the time.  More complete information would have been available in records going back to 1989 held at headquarters, but I regret that it was not brought to my attention until March.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that I should have paid more attention to an anonymous note Deputy Spring is supposed to have given me or informed me of, presumably in the margins of a meeting on 4 September about the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  I am now satisfied that I was not given any such note and that Rennicks was not mentioned to me, though some concern may have been expressed to me in more general terms on foot of anonymous information.  Deputy Quinn seriously misinformed the Dáil on this subject, suggesting that I was given specific details which I was not.  I look forward, when he has further checked the matter, to his correcting the record of the House at the first opportunity as his allegation was damaging to me and unfounded. In any event neither the Taoiseach nor any other Member of the House is obliged to pay great attention to or follow up anonymous letters, which have no legal standing and are frequently a vehicle for spreading gossip, rumour and factually incorrect or defamatory statements.  The main allegation contained in the note, that Ray Burke asked three company executives for a party donation in return for an IDA grant, is strenuously denied by all concerned, even if the amount of the donation appears to be correct.  A journalist who has an interest in these matters reminded me recently that he had spoken to me late at night last October and referred to the note, which he had investigated and found in many important respects to be untrue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> I accepted Deputy Burke's explanation in good faith, as did other Members of the House.  If my statement is to be construed as inadvertently misleading the House, then I regret that.  When it came to light, as a result of the request of a tribunal, that the documentation supported a different explanation, that information was referred by my party to the Flood tribunal, which had been charged by the Dáil with the follow-up investigation and which inquired specifically about what payments Ray Burke had made to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Discovery is the process by which either party to a civil action may inspect those documents held by the other party which are relevant to the claim. The party making discovery is required to list the relevant documents which they have or had in their possession.  It is not a discursive exercise.  In this case what was requested from us, apart from payments by James Gogarty, Michael Bailey or any connected person or company, was &ldquo;all statements of account, correspondence, receipts, deposit slips and any other records or documents of any description whatsoever relating to the payment of any sums of money by Raphael P. Burke to the Fianna Fáil National Organisation since the 1st of January 1989&rdquo;.  We complied fully with that order of discovery.  Party records only showed a receipt for £10,000 made out to Rennicks, a cash book entry for the same amount and a compliments slip from Rennicks with Ray Burke's name on it.  The affidavit was descriptive of the documents we furnished.  Further inquiries with Rennicks suggested that the total donation to Ray Burke amounted to £30,000.</P>
    <P>Since it has become a matter of some controversy, I wish to place on record an outline of the communications between Mr. Des Richardson, the party's fund-raiser, and representatives of Rennicks as he has given them to me and which he is prepared to give as sworn evidence to a tribunal. When I learned of the £10,000 receipt, in the latter part of March, I instructed Mr. Richardson, as a matter of courtesy, to inform Rennicks that this would form part of our affidavit.  On 2 April, the chairman of Rennicks conveyed his thanks to me for that courtesy.  The first reaction of the company's representative was to deny that any money had been given by Rennicks and threaten Fianna Fáil with an injunction if the affidavit were proceeded with.  By way of circumstantial corroboration I refer to an article by Jody Corcoran in the last weekend's <i>Sunday Independent</i> which stated: &ldquo;There is a consistency to the Company's initial denial.  Last September, Rennicks' wife Maureen, when contacted by the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> denied that the Company had given £30,000 to Burke&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>After his initial contact with Mr. David Byrne, who was acting on behalf of Robin Rennicks, in the next conversation a day later, Mr. Richardson was given a different version, this time involving a £30,000 contribution, but not routed through Ray Burke.  At a subsequent meeting a number of days later, the full story emerged that a cheque for £30,000 had been made out to cash and given <Col N="1165" /> to Ray Burke.  The receipt for £10,000, a copy of which is in the party's records, apparently cannot be traced by Rennicks.  In the account I gave to the House last week, I regret that l was mistaken in one particular aspect.  It was Mr. Byrne, not Mr. Rennicks, who corrected the original information that he had given us.  I wish to correct the record of the House in that respect and apologise to Mr. Byrne for any distress caused in that regard.  However, Mr. Richardson is quite adamant that the full information was only conveyed in a subsequent conversation.  Having been given more than one version of the situation, and having no independent verification, the party adhered to supplying the documentation it had been requested to provide and the information for which it could vouch.</P>
    <P>In response to the request for records of payment by Ray Burke, we brought the Rennicks payment to the attention of the tribunal.  This was new information of which the tribunal showed no prior knowledge or confirmation and the Rennicks payment was not the subject of any specific request by it, despite some impression given to the contrary.  This gave the tribunal the lead to follow up any further information, which I understand it did.  In early April Mr. Richardson was given a copy of the anonymous note, which we subsequently furnished to the tribunal when this controversy arose, as others may have done previously.</P>

At the end of March, my total attention and priority was given to the bringing of the peace talks to a successful conclusion.  I was informed about and approved of the steps taken by party officials to co-operate fully with the request of the tribunal.

I have shown that I will do this without fear or favour in co-operation with other Members of the House.

I am sure that ideal is widely shared across the floor of this House.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has made a number of statements to the Dáil and elsewhere which have proved subsequently to be factually incorrect. The statement last October that it was the JMSE donation of £10,000 which Mr. Ray Burke gave to Fianna Fáil was untrue.  The Taoiseach stated that he and the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, had carried out exhaustive investigations <Col N="1167" /> on Mr. Burke and the full array of allegations against him.  This is untrue.  He assured us that Fianna Fáil had volunteered all relevant information on the Rennicks donation to the Flood tribunal.  This was untrue.  A legal minimum requirement was furnished.  He claimed that Rennicks had denied the donation initially and has now apologised to Mr. Burke.  All these statements have been exposed as a shabby shifty series of untruths and, at worst, the systematic protection of the Taoiseach's former colleague Mr. Burke.</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach severed Mr. Burke's membership of Fianna Fáil?  If not, why not?  Is it not the case that a vengeful Mr. Burke poses the biggest political threat of all to the Taoiseach?</P>

      <P>One of the most vocal players in this controversy over the past week has been Independent Newspapers.  There have been repeated and blatant examples of the commercial interests of this group being articulated in front page stories and editorial comment.  This lacks credibility.  Attacks on Deputy John Bruton, Fine Gael and <i>The Irish Times</i> smack of panic.  Independent Newspapers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister of State does not like attacks on Independent Newspapers.  If he could look after the price of the pint it would be a help.  Independent Newspapers, through Princes Holdings, Independent Wireless Cable Limited, Westward Cable and Cork Communications, has 18 of 29 MMDS franchise licences.  If everything to do with the Fitzwilton donation and Mr. Burke's handling of the MMDS issues is exemplary from the perspective of Independent Newspapers, these newspapers should be in the vanguard calling for the most thorough, wide ranging tribunal to vindicate their position, yet no such call has been made.  They have been forthright in calling for tribunals on other issues and I challenge them to do so now.  It is not healthy that this dominant newspaper group should have such a strong in-house commercial agenda.  The <Col N="1168" /> sooner these non-media and media interests are disentangled the better for Irish journalism and political debate.</P>
      <P>I contend that the decisions relating to the MMDS licences made by the then Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, and the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government in 1989-92 were contrary to the public interest.  This public interest is twofold &mdash; first, the taxpayer and, second, residential householders seeking access to multichannel television services.  There are currently legal claims by the MMDS industry, including Princes Holdings and CMI Limited, before the courts, whereby the Government is being sued for the failure to implement the exclusivity given by Mr. Burke to MMDS operators.  These claims could amount to £100 million.  The statement of claim is awaited from Princes Holdings.  The licensing terms and subsequent ministerial assurances of 28 May 1990 to the Cable Association and the 4 February 1991 letter to Mr. Joe Hayes of Independent Newspapers are part of these compensation claims.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer is exposed because the Government of the day thought more about protecting the interests of MMDS investors than the taxpayer. I do not accept that MMDS investors were entitled to legal guarantees eliminating risk on their investments.  Many other franchise operators licensed by the same Department, for example, Century Radio and other radio stations, were not entitled to such protection on their investments.</P>
      <P>In effect, Mr. Burke issued licences for a 20-year period from 1989 to 2009.  The latter ten-year period covers the inevitable switch from analogue to digital signal broadcasting and retransmission. The enormity of this has not been grasped.  The exclusivity given to MMDS will form the basis of a further protracted series of legal compensation claims.  The Government should licence a digital terrestrial television system to provide universal access to households across the country.  RTE has submitted detailed proposals on digico for retransmission.  The Government is due to make decisions on this legal framework for digitisation later this month.  If the Government proceeds to licence digico or a variation of it, MMDS operators will sue a second time.  Thus, the taxpayer is vulnerable to a second compensation threat through the courts.  The then Minister, Mr. Burke, and Government provided all the ammunition for such an assault on the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter of public interest relates to the rights of each householder in the country to multichannel television access.  MMDS technology is inadequate.  It operates on the basis of line of sight signals whereby a signal is beamed from a mast to the receiver on the television set. Due to the topography of many rural areas there is no coverage there.  The quality of the service is not optimal and it is impossible to video record on one station while watching another.  Many households have been disconnected from community deflector services due to civil actions by <Col N="1169" /> MMDS representatives.  They find they are restricted to RTE services only because of the failure of MMDS to provide a service.</P>
    <P>There is a monopoly created by Mr. Burke without any service obligations.  There are tens of thousands of homes whose demand for multichannel reception has been ignored wilfully by the Government.  If and when the remaining community television deflector groups are closed down there may be in excess of 250,000 homes with no guarantee of a multichannel service. Incredibly, before embarking on this MMDS exclusivity no technical study was carried out by the Department to see if every household could get coverage.</P>
    <P>The decisions made in 1989-92 on MMDS are proving to be highly imprudent and may transpire to be disastrous.  The public wants to know whether it is a case of maladministration or the result of too cosy a relationship between business and political interests.  Only a tribunal of inquiry can ascertain the truth.</P>
    <P>There are terms of reference needed to guide such an inquiry and these should include full details of all moneys donated to Mr. Ray Burke, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats between 1989 and 1992 by MMDS franchise operators and their associated companies.  This should include payments made to Mr. Burke's agents, such as his solicitor if there was a client account.</P>
    <P>The validity of individual applications for MMDS licences should be fully checked out. Deputy Rabbitte alluded to this in terms of the common knowledge in Wexford of an allegation that the former Minister, Mr. Burke, canvassed Independent Newspapers to lodge an application. The story is that the applications were not received in time and they were handed into the Department by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The full series of communications and representations between the MMDS industry, Independent Newspapers and the then Department of Communications where Ray Burke was Minister between 1989 and 1992 should be checked.  There is a consistent pattern of the Minister being led by the nose in missives from Middle Abbey Street and elsewhere, which were dutifully copied and put into written guarantees that are now the basis of legal compensation claims.  There should be examination of the difference between official advice as offered departmentally to the then Minister and his subsequent actions, the reason no technical assessment was carried out as to the coverage of MMDS throughout the country, why there were no service obligations on MMDS licences to provide minimum levels of reception to householders and why it was necessary to provide a second ten year period of licence renewal on a virtually automatic basis &mdash; I quote from the regulations of 1989 &mdash; unless MMDS operators showed grave dissatisfaction, which was one of the key changes made by Mr. Burke from the technical advice in terms of the performance of those operators.  Was Mr. Burke compromised in relation to MMDS decisions not only by virtue of <Col N="1170" /> a political donation but because of the strong media power of Independent Newspapers?</P>
    <P>Today the Taoiseach expressed regret in a few areas, but he did not deal with the major issues. Confidence in him and his Government is shattered by his handling of this issue and the Opposition will not rest until the full truth emerges.</P>

      <P>The startling revelations in <i>Magill</i> magazine last week that Rennicks, a company closely associated with Princes Holdings which has numerous MMDS franchises throughout the country, had given a substantial financial donation to Ray Burke while Minister for Communications with responsibility for allocating licences sent alarm bells ringing throughout County Donegal at the weekend.  No other issue I can recall in the past 20 years has caused so much political convulsion in the county as has the MMDS issue.  The largest public meetings I attended in the county in the run-up to the last election were in opposition to the imposition of this system of television transmission.  It was seen as an ill-conceived system, unsuitable to the topography and needs of the west, a system rejected in many other countries and, in all probability, a system that will be obsolete in the near future.</P>
      <P>A valuable national asset was handed over to a number of companies over the heads of local communities who, through their endeavours and initiatives, provided a service at rock bottom prices on a non profit-making basis to thousands of isolated homesteads in Donegal and the west. The licences handed out by the then Minister, Mr. Burke, at £20,000 per franchise, were a lucrative commodity.  They carried the exclusive right of transmitting cross-channel television signals in their respective areas and a guarantee from the then Minister that all community-based deflectors were illegal and would be hounded off the air, backed by the full authority of his Department and the State.</P>
      <P>Some communities retreated by disbanding their own systems and accepting the MMDS supplied signals at a hugely increased cost.  Many groups in Donegal and the west, however, refused to disband their own community-financed deflector systems and are still holding firm in the belief that the MMDS companies cannot provide a matching quality signal at the same cost.  There are in excess of 50 deflector systems in Donegal, most of which are still transmitting in spite of legal threats and other intimidatory tactics by cable management companies.  In the light of last week's revelations of £30,000 being given privately to the then Minister, Mr. Burke, by a company within the Fitzwilton group while he had responsibility for allocating MMDS licences throws serious doubt on the legality of the entire process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the motion that the terms of reference of the Flood and Moriarty tribunals should be amended and extended to investigate the granting of MMDS licences while Ray Burke was Minister for Communications.  If it is discovered <Col N="1171" /> by the tribunal that there is an association between the granting of licences and donations made by companies that benefited, the legality and validity of such licences will be worthless. They would carry no more rights than the deflectors they were to replace.  Any decision made because of a bribe is corrupt and open to legal challenge.  It will be up to the tribunal to determine what exactly happened.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, until the tribunal reports, all actions against community-based deflectors should be terminated.  Legal action against landholders on whose land such deflectors are situated must be suspended.  No deflectors should be put off the air until the tribunal reports.  Until the legality or otherwise of the granting of these franchises by Ray Burke is determined, deflectors that have been closed down because of a threat of legal action by MMDS companies should be allowed recommence transmission.  I ask my Donegal colleagues to support this motion and stand by our rural communities until we have the tribunal's report on the validity of MMDS licences issued under dubious circumstances by Mr. Burke when Minister for Communications.</P>

      <P>In my contribution to the debate on this all-Opposition party motion, I will concentrate on the history of this murky affair.  It is a sad history of, at best, incompetence or, at worst, corruption.  On 11 September 1997 this House debated the terms of reference for the establishment of the Moriarty tribunal.  Among the amendments I pushed to a vote on behalf of the Labour Party was a proposal to ensure the Ansbacher accounts were fully included in the remit of the Moriarty tribunal and fully investigated. The Ansbacher accounts were the greatest focus of the people at the time, a point mentioned by speakers of all political persuasions.  That amendment was voted down by the Fianna FáilProgressive Democrats Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reasoning behind this decision was not given in response to the debate by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, who spoke on behalf of the Government.  We were later told, however, that a fear in Government circles that there would be a &ldquo;flight of capital&rdquo; from the country if the Ansbacher accounts were fully investigated caused the Government to take that course of action.  No spokesperson from the Government or the Central Bank was willing, at that time or since, to back up that exaggerated and overblown claim.  The Government has resisted any proposal to include the Ansbacher accounts in the remit of any tribunal of inquiry.  There has never been a satisfactory explanation for this apparent Government policy.  The story from September to today warrants examination and demands explanation from each of the parties in Government.  On the same day, 11 September last, the Government and its supporters in this House voted down combined Opposition attempts to have the Burke <Col N="1172" /> payments referred even for a preliminary sifting or examination by the new Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Magill</i> magazine published extracts of a letter from Mr. Bailey to Mr. Gogarty on 25 September last suggesting that he could procure planning permission for 726 acres in north County Dublin. The letter was written three days before Mr. Burke was given £30,000 in June 1989.  When that magazine article appeared on 25 September last, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste belatedly recognised that something had to be done.  Three days later, on 28 September last, the Taoiseach announced a separate tribunal of inquiry to investigate planning.  On 26 March 1998, the Government brought a Bill before the Dáil which sought a change in the law governing tribunals of inquiry.  At that time, my party colleague and spokesman on justice, Deputy Upton, said the Bill was unnecessary, unwarranted and an attack on the democratic powers of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Flood, who at the same time was running a tribunal about planning in North County Dublin, completely undermined the Government's line of argument by asking for a change in his terms of reference.  The Government had contended it was not possible to change the terms of reference of a tribunal when it had been established.  However, it had to agree to do so because of a request from a judge of the High Court.  It had to state, contrary to the opinion of all other parties and any legal advice we could get, that new legislation was required to allow the Dáil and Seanad pass a simple resolution to give Mr. Justice Flood the powers he sought.</P>
    <P>Quite extraordinary new legislation was produced. The new Bill, signed into law last month, specifies that there can be no change to the terms of reference of a judicial inquiry unless a judge requests such a change.  This was legislation that no Member of the House, except the Government, believed was necessary.  The legal advice available to us agreed it was unnecessary and a report in a Sunday paper stated that the official advice available to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was that it was unnecessary.</P>
    <P>As a result of last month's Act &mdash; purportedly a response to a request from Mr. Justice Flood, the Government went out of its way to limit the powers of Dáil Éireann and, by extension, the powers of every citizen of the country.  That course of action was an insult to the House, to our citizens and to the chairpersons and staff of the tribunals of inquiry currently under way.</P>
    <P>I will restate the course of events that led to that undemocratic and unnecessary legislation put before the House by the Government on 26 March.  The Government voted down a Labour Party amendment to the original terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  That amendment would have empowered the tribunal to fully investigate the Ansbacher accounts.  I would love to know what is in those accounts because the parties in Government are very fearful of them. The House was not given an adequate reason for <Col N="1173" /> the proposal's rejection.  The Government subsequently voted down an all-party Opposition motion which sought to extend the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal and attempted to justify this action by citing unspecified legal advice that has never been brought into the public domain and is unconvincing.  Despite the massive public concern about the Ansbacher accounts and the public demand that they should be fully and publicly investigated, the Government stoutly refused to accede to this request and its reasons for doing so remain unclear.  The buttonlip approach to the Ansbacher accounts, and to the wider question of how we should establish and conduct tribunals of inquiry in this House, is a disgrace and an affront to the democratic process. Finally, and most devastatingly of all, Mr. Justice Flood, who was chairing a separate tribunal, wrote to the Houses of the Oireachtas asking for a change to his terms of reference.  On 1 April last, the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, specifically asked the Taoiseach where the Office of the Attorney General turned to for external legal advice and the cost of such advice in respect of amendments to legislation on tribunals of inquiry.  The Taoiseach responded by stating: &ldquo;Since I do not have the information with me, I give an undertaking to supply it to the Deputy&rdquo;.  We are still awaiting the Taoiseach's delivery on that undertaking.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that when Mr. Justice Flood made his request to extend the terms of reference of the planning tribunal, he was expecting the necessary resolution of the House to be made under the terms of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  I do not believe Mr. Justice Flood requested new legislation to be drafted and neither do I believe he expected his reasonable request to be used by the Government to restrict the powers of the Oireachtas to set parameters for the conduct of all future tribunals of inquiry. His request was seized upon by the Government to restrict the authority of the House to fully investigate matters of public concern.  The Taoiseach and both parties in Government must answer for that.  If the Government had agreed to Mr. Justice Flood's request, without concocting the need for further legislation, it would have exposed its vulnerability on the relatively simple question of how to change the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal to include an investigation of the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet discussed the request from Mr. Justice Flood at a meeting on 3 March 1998 and the events that have followed since that meeting have given rise to extremely serious questions that go to the heart of our democratic process.  At best, the Government's attitude to this matter can be described as incompetent; at worst, it is downright dishonest.  The result is the legislation we are reconsidering today which was signed into law a month ago, but events have required the parties in Government to publish draft amending legislation that closely reflects the Bill moved on today's Order of Business by Deputy Quinn.  The <Col N="1174" /> terms of this legislation will return to haunt the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue.  In defence of this Bill on 26 March, he stated:</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton and others appeared to suggest that somebody should go to Mr. Justice Moriarty and ask him if he wants the terms of reference of his tribunal amended.  However, anybody who went to Mr. Justice Moriarty, or any other judge in charge of a tribunal, and asked him if he felt the terms of reference of his tribunal should be amended might be considered by many to be interfering with the judicial independence of the chairperson of the tribunal.  If any member of the Government did that, legitimate questions would be asked in the House.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the Attorney General was doing for the past few days.</P>
    <P>By accepting the need for this new legislation, the Government has woken up to the reality which has been patently obvious to the rest of us.  Three months ago it cynically published a Bill providing for the narrowest possible circumstances in which the remit of a tribunal could be amended and rammed it through both Houses of the Oireachtas, despite objections from the Labour Party and others.  Those objections have now proved to be comprehensively correct.  However, the Government has been found out and has been forced to revise Deputy O'Donoghue's Act.  The view expressed in the House on 11 December 1997 by the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, when she spoke passionately of the Moriarty tribunal being a final opportunity to restore public confidence in the operation of the political system, remains even more urgent today.  The Government and its constituent parties have blundered for the past nine months and politics has been the loser.</P>

      <P>We have seen two very different sides of Irish politics in the past two weeks.  A fortnight ago the people gave their overwhelming support to the British-Irish Agreement.  That was a vote for peace, but it was also a vote for politics and the political system, a recognition that politicians of all parties could work together to improve the lives of the people they represent. That was the acceptable face of Irish politics. However, a fortnight later, we are looking at an unacceptable side of Irish politics.  We are dealing with very serious allegations against Mr. Ray Burke, a person who has held senior ministerial <Col N="1175" /> office in a number of Governments.  Yet again we are facing into a crisis of public confidence in our political system.</P>
      <P>Strong and decisive action is required in order to restore that confidence.  All the allegations which have been made against Mr. Burke should be fully investigated by a tribunal of inquiry as deemed appropriate by this House.  That investigation will have to be comprehensive.  It will have to inquire into the financial contributions made to him during his political career and the decisions made by him in his various ministries to ascertain if any of them were influenced in any way by contributions received.</P>
      <P>The Government is taking the necessary steps to provide such an inquiry by extending the remit of the tribunal which is currently constituted under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Flood.  Facing such an inquiry is no doubt a daunting prospect for Mr. Burke, but if he had been more honest in his statement to the House on 11 September 1997 he might not now be facing the same fate as Mr. Haughey and Mr. Lowry.  Technically, Mr. Burke may argue that he did not mislead the Dáil on that occasion, but few could argue that the Dáil was not misled.  We now see Mr. Burke chose his words with extraordinary care in order to ensure maximum economy with the truth.  He stated in regard to the £30,000 contribution which he received from Mr. Gogarty of JMSE:</P>
      <P>As regards the contribution, £30,000 is the largest contribution I have received during any election campaign either before or since 1989.</P>
      <P>Most of us took that to mean that there was only one contribution of £30,000.  Mr. Burke knew that there was another in that same year, but he did not tell the House.  Weasel words have a habit of finding their way into personal statements in recent times.</P>
      <P>If what is now known in regard to payments to Mr. Burke was known to me last June I would not have been willing to participate in Government with him.  It is up to the various tribunals to do their job.  For my part, I hope the work of the Moriarty and Flood tribunals can help to cut out once and for all the taint of grubby dealings and corruption which has debased Irish politics for over a generation.  I assure the House also that, in the light of the controversy which has arisen around Rennicks, I will do everything I can to make the full facts available regarding all dealings between that company, the State development agencies and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is important that all the relevant information is put into the public domain as quickly as possible.  We published a preliminary report from the chief executive of Forbairt last Friday.</P>
      <P>My officials are currently working to assemble all the documentation in this area and I intend to make it public at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>I hope so.  Deputy Richard Bruton tabled a written question for tomorrow on the matter and I hope to make the information I have available to him.  In my capacity as Minister, I have instituted 11 separate inquiries into various suspected breaches of our company laws.  I did not lightly take this course of action and, in response to Deputy Howlin, the Ansbacher accounts are being investigated.  I do not want to make any comment that could prejudice the work of any of those inquiries, all of which are being carried out in a diligent and proper manner by dedicated professionals in whom I have every confidence.  As a result of these inquiries, new and disturbing information has come to light and this will have to be fully investigated.  I have not been afraid to establish such inquiries when I thought they were appropriate.  Equally, I have never been afraid to support the establishment of public inquiries where I thought they were appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is worth reminding the House that in December 1996 the Progressive Democrats Party moved a motion to establish a tribunal to inquire into payments to politicians by Dunnes Stores. When moving that motion Deputy Bobby Molloy spoke of the public's right to know and of the need to uphold the integrity of our democratic system.  He stated correctly that a tribunal of inquiry was essential if we were to get at the truth.  That motion ultimately led to the establishment of the McCracken tribunal, one which everyone agrees did an excellent job speedily and efficiently.</P>
      <P>Politicians must be consistent if they want to regain public respect.  It is no use calling for inquiries in Opposition but then resisting them in Government.  We should all have one interest &mdash; pursuing the truth.  Rebuilding trust between politicians and people will take more than tribunals of inquiry.  We must ensure Government goes about its business in a way that is entirely above suspicion.  Many of the political controversies of recent years stem from the way in which State assets were disposed of or the way in which lucrative State licences were awarded.  The current controversy, for instance, revolves to a large extent around the manner in which Mr. Ray Burke handled the granting of licences to MMDS operators.  Another controversy centred on the manner in which Mr. Michael Lowry handled the granting of mobile 'phone licences.  On neither occasion were memoranda brought before the Government.  I have no evidence that either man acted improperly.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, it is essential we have new arrangements in place at both governmental and administrative level so that all transactions involving the sale of State assets or the granting of State licences can be handled in a manner that is as transparent and accountable as possible.  I have already discussed these matters with the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>This Government has a privatising and liberalising agenda that is more ambitious than that of any of its predecessors.  I do not want any part of that agenda to become embroiled in future controversy.  I am a strong advocate of competition and I agree with comments made by Opposition Deputies about the need for competition in the media.  The people have certainly had their fill of political scandals in the last few years. People are bewildered, annoyed and angered at what they see and hear.  Indeed, the names Haughey, Lowry and Burke may be linked together as some form of unholy trinity when future generations come to write the history of Ireland in the late 1990s.</P>
      <P>For a growing number of people politics has become a world of brown envelopes and backhanders, shady deals and offshore accounts.  That is not the kind of politics I practise, nor are they the politics practised by the vast majority of Deputies.  As politicians we have a duty to ensure that the scandals of the past are fully and properly investigated and that such scandals never again blot the political landscape.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's political credo since he entered this House is that public service cannot be self-service.  A philosophy of self-service runs counter to everything he stands for in politics.  It debases politics and destroys the trust that should exist between the public and politicians. This Government and this party has no place for anyone who does not live up to the high standards set by the Taoiseach from the day he became party Leader.  The Opposition, which recognises the Taoiseach's political probity and the high esteem in which he is held by the public, has launched a politically motivated attack on the handling of the appointment of Mr. Burke to political office and the handling of the discovery by Fianna Fáil, in March this year, that Mr. Burke had received a second donation of £30,000 which he had not mentioned in his speech to this House.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has outlined the steps he took to make inquiries prior to the appointment of Mr. Burke.  Both last week and today, he has outlined fully &mdash; despite the way some Members have tried to twist it &mdash; the extent to which I was involved in those inquiries.  For the record, as Chief Whip in that period I was acutely aware as to how the persistent rumours regarding Mr. Burke had caused worry to Deputy Bertie Ahern.  He mentioned this to me on numerous occasions and indicated he had tried to find out to the best of his ability if there was any truth to the rumours, but to no avail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will quote from the contemporaneous notes which I took of the two meetings I had during my inquiries.  The full details of these contemporaneous accounts have been given to the tribunal by the Fianna Fáil legal team.  On 24 June, I travelled to London to meet Mr. Joseph Murphy junior.  This meeting had been arranged with Mr. Murphy at the request of Deputy Bertie Ahern through a third party.  I thanked him for taking the time to meet me and confirmed I was there at the request of my party Leader.  I informed him that Deputy Bertie Ahern was worried about persistent allegations which had surfaced in the media, particularly in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>, and rumours regarding Mr. Burke.  I informed him it was being alleged that different amounts, including £40,000, had been handed to Mr. Burke at a meeting attended by a leading builder, either <Col N="1179" /> his father or himself, and an employee of Murphys called Mr. Gogarty.  I said our party Leader had, during the election, been questioned about this and responded by stating he had spoken to Mr. Burke on a number of occasions regarding the persistent rumours and that Mr. Burke categorically denied there was any truth in them.  I informed Mr. Murphy that our party Leader wished to get to the bottom of this before he made his appointments to the Cabinet the following Thursday, 26 June.</P>
    <P>I asked Mr. Murphy the following questions. First, did either he or his father participate in a meeting attended by Mr. Burke, a leading builder and Mr. Gogarty during which a large sum of money, cash, cheque or both, was handed over to Mr. Burke?  Second, if such a sum was handed over, was any undertaking given by Mr. Burke? Third, was there any meeting between his company and Mr. Burke regarding the company's lands?</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy categorically answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to each of the three questions.  He immediately and vehemently denied these allegations, and stated that he and his company had been the recipients of constant innuendo and allegations from Mr. Gogarty mainly because Mr. Gogarty, a former employee, had fallen out with the company over financial arrangements.  He produced an extremely thick file with Mr. Gogarty's name on it and showed me numerous documents relating to his company's dispute with Mr. Gogarty, including copious court documents.</P>
    <P>Mr. Murphy stated that his father had retired from the business in 1982 and had lived in Guernsey ever since.  He stated his father could not have attended a meeting in 1989.  His father probably did not even know Mr. Burke or what constituency he represented.</P>
    <P>I left Mr. Murphy on the basis that, if necessary, either myself or Deputy Bertie Ahern could telephone him if we required to speak to him again and he readily agreed to this.  The meeting ended and immediately on my return to Dublin I informed my party Leader of the details.</P>
    <P>On 30 June 1997, the Monday immediately after the formation of the Government, I received a telephone call from Mr. Murphy, who said he was coming over the next day and wished to see me as a follow on from our previous meeting in London.  Again, he continuously maintained during this meeting that his company had nothing to do with any of these allegations.  He stated that since our last meeting he had again spoken to his father, who reiterated that neither he, the company nor Mr. Murphy senior had at any time had any dealings with Mr. Burke.  He confirmed that Mr. Gogarty was the signatory for all their cheques in Ireland but they always required a second signatory, with whom he had checked; he had also checked through the records for this period and there were no payments which indicated any of this.</P>
    <P>At the time I made written reports of these <Col N="1180" /> meetings.  On each occasion I reported to the Taoiseach, as he had then become.  I submitted these reports in full to the Flood tribunal.  It is for that tribunal to investigate this matter and to draw appropriate conclusions.  There are other issues in those reports which I do not care to put before the House because it is proper to put them before the tribunal rather than raising hares in this House.  I have no direct evidence of these things, given that all of what I was told was hearsay. Unlike others, I will not throw allegations across the floor of the House without evidence.  I do not intend to collude with the Opposition in turning this House into a star chamber which can judge people without due process.  Everyone is entitled to a fair hearing and that is the task of the tribunals we have established.</P>
    <P>To the best of my knowledge, at the time of the appointment of Mr. Burke the Taoiseach, having made all the inquiries he could reasonably have made, had discovered no proof that any payments, improper or otherwise, had been made to Mr. Burke.  I do not know what else the Taoiseach could have done at that time to check these rumours.  There is a need for the Deputies opposite and some outside this House to get a grasp on reality when they refer to the investigations carried out prior to the appointment of Mr. Burke.  We are talking about a number of public representatives elected to serve their constituents with no special powers or immunities to investigate their colleagues.  The Taoiseach, as I said, did everything he could reasonably have done to make the inquiries which were possible in the circumstances.  What investigations did Deputy Bruton make before he appointed Deputy Lowry as Minister?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to recent events, the Taoiseach has accepted that, with the benefit of hindsight, he might have handled the matter differently.  He might have come before the House, for example, to inform it directly of the information which had been given to the tribunal acting on its behalf.  Hindsight is a great thing.  We all remember that over the period in question the Taoiseach was not relaxing in his office with nothing much on his mind.  Rather he was, with others, working day and night to ensure that the tenuous peace which had been achieved in Northern Ireland could be copperfastened as it eventually was in the British-Irish Agreement and subsequently in the all-Ireland referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In both cases &mdash; the inquiries in 1997 and the handling of the matter from March this year &mdash; there is no allegation of any wrongdoing on the part of the Taoiseach or any member of the Government.  The Opposition has attempted to build allegations out of nothing in a malicious attack on the Government.  Bereft of policies, bereft of ideas, the combined Opposition is reduced to the politics of mudslinging.  Fine Gael, <Col N="1181" /> in particular, has proved itself good at that if at nothing else.</P>

      <P>This Government is built on integrity.  All allegations will be fully investigated &mdash; publicly and fairly &mdash; by the appropriate tribunals.</P>

      <P>The most ironic aspect of this controversy is the high moral tone adopted by the Opposition, in particular by Deputy John Bruton. I remind the House that Deputy Bruton supposedly espoused the values of openness, transparency and accountability.  Yet, on accession to office, he reneged on his promises to deliver openness, transparency and accountability.  In fact he trampled on those principles day in day out. That we did not ask the right questions was used as an excuse for evasion of the truth on more than one occasion in this House.  Deputy Bruton, far from running a Government, as promised, as if from behind a pane of glass, ran the most closed, evasive and the least transparent Government in these isles since the time of Charles II.</P>

Deputy Bruton must admit he promised shortly before becoming Taoiseach that he would compel those appointed to the Cabinet to publish their tax returns.  What happened to that promise?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was posed by Deputy Bruton and others earlier as to what Mr. Burke has got on the Taoiseach to cause such unwavering loyalty towards his former Cabinet colleague.  That the Taoiseach has been so unconvincing, misleading and forgetful in his recall of the events surrounding this controversy has done nothing to quell the speculation about the Taoiseach and Mr. Burke.  Deputy Gormley and myself have had information passed to our office, albeit anonymously, that if a tribunal, sufficiently empowered by this House, were to examine the list of companies which succeeded in getting on the tender list for a major public project in the <Col N="1186" /> Dublin Central constituency in 1991-2, and compare it with a list of companies which contributed sums of £5,000 and upwards to a particular political party in that constituency at the time, one would find a very high degree of overlap.  If, say, the degree of overlap between the two lists was greater than 75 per cent, there might be a case for drawing the tentative conclusion, subject to full and thorough investigation by a competent authority, that there was more involved than coincidence.</P>
      <P>In investigating this matter the tribunal might come to substantial conclusions, which it would be unwise to attempt to prejudge.  Equally, it might render the service of clearing the good names and reputations of those persons in public life who have been linked by innuendo and anecdote in the engineering and construction industries to the management, or alleged mismanagement, of that contract.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to north County Dublin in his contribution.  In 1993, when I was a member of Dublin County Council, I received through the post a cheque for £100 from a small developer.  This cheque was attached to a rezoning proposal seeking my support and that of my Green Party colleagues in a vote to rezone farmland for residentially zoned land.  I had never before or since received a donation in such circumstances but it is often alleged that donations of this sort are commonplace.</P>
      <P>To determine whether there was any substance to this viewpoint, I asked a straight question in the council chamber of the councillors from all parties at one of the many bizarre meetings during the 1993 development plan review, where a coalition of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil councillors consistently voted to rezone farmland against the advice of professional planning officials.  I asked whether any other councillor had received a payment of money or other gift as encouragement to vote in favour of a proposal to rezone land.  I did not get a clear answer.  Instead, I was treated to a tirade of abuse, told to resume my seat and then grabbed by the neck from behind and surrounded by councillors who strained to grab the cheque I had been asked to show.  The meeting had to be adjourned in disorder and I was escorted to the county manager's office for my own safety.</P>
      <P>The view of that meeting in <i>The Irish Times</i> subsequently was quite telling.  The report stated that senior county planners were convinced that more of the Liffey Valley area would have been lost if Trevor Sargent had not brandished his cheque at a meeting of Dublin County Council last February asking whether any other members had received similar donations.</P>
      <P>Most of the councillors who had grabbed me in such a violent way were from Fianna Fáil.  How much longer can Fianna Fáil continue to behave like some institutional party of the revolution, believing it is not subject to the same checks and balances that apply to everyone else?</P>

    <P>The payment to Ray Burke scandal is the latest we know of in a succession of such stories that go <Col N="1187" /> back to the foundation of the Irish Press Company in the early 1930s, brilliantly illuminated by the late Noel Browne some 30 years ago.  Fianna Fáil believes it is different, and it is more than just a question of &ldquo;is that a bank draft in your pocket or have you just come to realise how much Fianna Fáil can do for you?&ldquo; The Burke saga is important in what it reveals about the style of the Fianna Fáil institution and its way of doing business.  Does the Taoiseach accept that in his resignation statement Mr. Burke, far from defending the integrity of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government which Fianna Fáil leads and the honour of this House, misled the Taoiseach &mdash; apparently deliberately &mdash; and the House in a way that became apparent to the Taoiseach some weeks ago, and has created a fatal mistrust between the parties of this coalition?</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke expected that the facts presented in his statement of 10 September 1997 would not, as he said, in all cases satisfy everybody.  Did he have any indication that his statement, which concealed so much with such brilliant disingenuousness, was satisfactory in so far as the Taoiseach, who had made him a Minister, was concerned?</P>
    <P>This House remains unaware of, and the public remains uninformed about, the exact amount Tony O'Reilly, through Fitzwilton or through any of his other interests, pumped into Fianna Fáil in recent times before the <i>Irish Independent</i> declared that payback time had finally arrived.</P>
    <P>It is a shame, and no credit to this Government, that such donors and donations will have to be winkled out by the media and expensive tribunals of inquiry.  It would be far more appropriate if the committees of this House had sufficient powers of inquiry to summon Mr. O'Reilly, and his management executives, and require from them information and files on their payments to politicians over the years.</P>
    <P>Are we to go back to the ethos of the institutional party of the revolution currently in Fianna Fáil?  In other words, whatever benefits the party and the party leadership received must not be questioned too closely.  Is it the attitude that Fianna Fáil plays it fast and loose and that casualties are inevitable?  That is to say some will get caught but we will sacrifice those and carry on.  This Fianna Fáil culture, which is at the heart of this matter, must be thoroughly investigated.</P>

      <P>As the only Deputy elected on the issue of MMDS versus the voluntary community deflector system, it does not give me any pleasure to outline briefly the unacceptable manner in which the rural population was treated in the attempted imposition of MMDS.  In my constituency of south west Donegal, we became aware of the threatened imposition of MMDS in March 1988.  From March 1988 until March 1997, we pleaded with our political representatives to give some form of licensing, legal standing or recognition <Col N="1188" /> to our community deflectors, but to no avail. In March 1997, we had no option but to enter the political arena, which we did successfully.</P>
      <P>When Cable Management Ireland Limited bought its MMDS licence from the corrupt former Minister for Communications, we were disappointed because with the attempted imposition of MMDS came the greatest onslaught ever mounted against the rural population since setting up this State.  The voluntary community development that led to setting up the deflector systems over 20 years ago came under fierce and concentrated attack.  Even up to the present day, Cable Management Ireland Limited and its ruthless personnel, including Mr. Ray Doyle and Mr. Padraig White, chairman of the company's board of directors, are engaged in the most vicious campaign of harassment against the law abiding rural dwellers of Donegal.  That campaign is also supported by the dangerous monolith of the Irish media world, Independent Newspapers, which has shown its true colours over the past few days when, among other things, it questioned the right of the law abiding rural population to participate in the democratic process.</P>
      <P>In view of the manner in which the MMDS licences were awarded by the former Minister Burke to companies which are in many ways associated with Independent Newspapers, and to companies such as Cable Management Ireland Limited, I ask the Government to use its influence to put a stop to the vicious campaign of harassment being implemented by CMI and allow the voluntary deflector systems to continue until the matter of Mr. Burke's acceptance of vast sums of money, which no doubt influenced the granting of the MMDS licences, is fully investigated.</P>
      <P>The voluntary community system of television transmission should be allowed to continue where demand exists.  I ask the Government to license deflector systems at an affordable cost.  These will continue to make multichannel voluntary community television available to even the weakest sections of our rural communities.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I speak tonight because of the editorial in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i>, which asked why the Government should not take on the people who set up illegal deflector systems.  I helped to set up the illegal deflector system in the west for which we did not receive £30,000 or even 30p.  We set it up because no Government or anyone else was prepared to bring a television signal into the west. I remember when many people went to Kiltimagh and other areas on Monday nights to watch the BBC's &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo;&mdash; which the gaelgeoirs did not like us watching &mdash; because they could get a signal from Enniskillen.  We then set up a deflector system in Westport and other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One day I spoke on local radio at 1.40 p.m. live from the Dáil Chamber.  I questioned why the then Minister, Ray Burke, gave exclusive licences <Col N="1189" /> with letters of comfort to these companies.  I asked about Mr. White, to whom Deputy Gildea referred, who was one of Fianna Fáil's backroom boys planning and plotting before the election. He was a member of a company which was involved in the legalised signals.  I asked some very serious questions at 1.40 p.m. which probably bordered on libel.  There was a vote in the Dáil at 2 p.m. during which the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ray Burke, pulled me aside and said &ldquo;You went above and beyond the call of duty today&rdquo;.  I was worried for many days afterwards about whether I would get a solicitor's letter because of what I said on local radio, which was to ask why any Minister would give exclusive licences to anyone.  When we were in Government we could not change that policy or introduce legislation, as Deputy Gildea said, to give the deflector operators an opportunity to tender for the licences because the job has been so well done &mdash; and we now know why.</P>
    <P>I do not have any scriptwriters or spin doctors to spell out what must be spelled out.  However, I wish to put one simple question to the Government &mdash; why would someone give £30,000 to a person or go to his house and ask to whom he should make a cheque payable?  People are forgetting that £30,000 in 1989 would probably be worth £50,000 or £60,000 in today's prices. Nobody gives someone £30,000 unless he does something for him.  We now know what was done, which will be proved by the tribunal.  We know why people who tendered for the licences got them, although some of the applications were late.  Nobody does anything for nothing in this world and £30,000 is a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>The people of the west, Donegal, Cork and Waterford are very sore about this.  They could not understand why Governments could not give licences to deflector operators who were prepared to bring a television signal into their homes.  The people who received the licences were only prepared to bring a signal into large centres of population and wanted to forget about rural areas.  I agree with Deputies Gildea, McGinley and others that attacks on deflector operators should be suspended.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, attacked the people in Kiltimagh when the Department of Communications took all their equipment.  That equipment, which was paid for with honest, decent money, should be returned until the inquiry is over.</P>
    <P>It was a bad day's work by Ray Burke.  This all dates back to the Charlie Haughey era when people brought him hundreds of thousands of pounds to maintain his lavish lifestyle.  That culture lasted.  I was surprised by Deputy Mary Harney tonight.  That was not the Deputy Harney I used to see sitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I intend to vote in favour of the motion.  Unfortunately, none of the major issues arising from this affair of the payment of substantial amounts of money to Mr. Ray Burke have been adequately dealt with or explained by the Taoiseach, the Government or the Progressive Democrats.  That does not surprise me because the reality is that leading members of Fianna Fáil find it very difficult to work themselves up to an appearance of being shocked by revelations of substantial payments by big business to politicians and political parties. Is the Taoiseach embarrassed that leading politicians in his party are up to their oxters in sleazy relationships with big business, or does he regard this as &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; and no more harmless than the same politicians kissing unfortunate babies at election time?  That is how it seems.</P>
      <P>The reality is that Fianna Fáil has thrived in the murky culture which has festered for decades in this State at the interface of business and politics. That culture blossomed as land owners and developers slapped the backs of Fianna Fáil councillors in the corridors of Dublin County Council, as they drooled in anticipation of those councillors supporting vast rezonings of land which would make them rich beyond the dreams of ordinary people and, incidentally, play a major role in pushing house prices obscenely outside the reach of ordinary working people on average wages.  That culture thrived when wealthy businessmen, or their runners, came to Mr. Burke's house with bulging envelopes or cheques made out to cash.</P>
      <P>However, there is an underlying hypocrisy in this debate from many of the establishment parties participating in it because the swampy ground at the interface of business and politics has not been infested just by Fianna Fáil politicians and it was not just Fianna Fáil councillors whose backs were slapped by developers and speculators at county council meetings.  Fine Gael and Progressive Democrats councillors also found themselves at the butt of tremendous praise from that section as they rowed in behind the rezoning juggernaut on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the major difference between business people calling at the offices or homes of politicians with their gifts and prominent party leaders rolling up to the fancy mansions of big business tycoons and sipping tea with them as they solicited extensive funds for their political parties?  The reality is that across the board the relationship between business and politics in this State has been a sleazy one for decades, as was revealed by this most recent scandal.  Ordinary <Col N="1191" /> decent people who must work for, and pay tax on, every penny they get do not believe that when large donations are given by big business to politicians nothing is expected in return.  They understand quite clearly how it works and they are absolutely right.</P>
    <P>Fitzwilton stated that it gave donations to all the main political parties through their representatives. Last Thursday in this House I called on all the parties concerned to state if they had received any moneys from Fitzwilton or any related individual or companies, and, if so, how much.  So far I have been greeted with deafening silence.  I call again on all parties to outline the moneys, if any, they have received from Fitzwilton and in what circumstances.</P>
    <P>What is meant by the phrase &ldquo;through their representatives&ldquo;?  Surely moneys or cheques would usually be sent to the head offices of the political parties?  In recent days, Independent Newspapers has grossly abused its power to criticise those who have asked hard questions about the granting of MMDS licences after 1989.  The group is loud in its denunciation of anybody, any institution or organisation which it believes do not adhere to standards it requires.  Given this, it is time to turn the fire back on the group, especially on the millionaires who are its main string pullers.  It should publish full details on the contributions it, Fitzwilton or related companies made to politicians or political parties over the past two decades.  Let us have the names, the amounts and the circumstances.  Perhaps then the group will appear more convincing in demanding higher standards.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people are disgusted with the type of sleaze that has come to light in recent times.  The bluff of the Progressive Democrats has been more than called.  Virtually its entire parliamentary party appeared for a few minutes during the debate, presumably to give token succour to the Government.  If the party continues to stand over these activities the taxi that brought its members here can be replaced by a motor bike and side car after the next general election because they will have no credibility in going back to the people.</P>

      <P>It is with regret that I support this motion.  We all had the right to expect that the tribunals already established would provide the means to investigate fully the <Col N="1192" /> serious allegations concerning the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, and others.  We also had the right to expect that the Government would live up to the promise of openness and transparency. However, while our assertion of our right to know has been vindicated in the light of these revelations, those expectations have proven to be naive.</P>
      <P>We have seen the unfolding saga of payments to Mr. Ray Burke, the astonishing generosity of Mr. Ben Dunne, which benefited both of the two larger parties, the Ansbacher account debacle and the protection of some of the wealthiest people in this country who were assisted in salting away their money and evading tax.  We have also seen the reluctance of Governments to allow full exposure of all these scandals.  Instead of the free flow of information, we have had to squeeze every fact out of those with privileged access to the relevant information.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to engage in the shadow boxing between the two major parties so frequently seen in this House, nor do I intend to unpick the details of this latest fiasco, important though they are.  Rather, I wish to reflect the view of the vast majority of citizens who observe this debate and rightly conclude that politics and politicians have been tarnished and debased, not just by the scandals of recent years, but by the ethos adopted by key players in the larger parties in this House for decades.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that many people dismiss politicians as corrupt.  What other conclusion can they draw as they see the succession of scandals that have emerged in recent years?  Those of us who are political opponents of the two major parties must battle daily against the justifiable apathy and cynicism about politics, which the decades of domination has induced in so many people.</P>
      <P>The central issue here is not the ethics of one individual or the credibility of one Taoiseach; it is the corrupt relationship between big business and the big political parties in the State.  The people are not fools.  Everybody knows that money does not flow from the coffers of big business to those major political parties without a flow of favouritism in the opposite direction.  The best illustration of that was the Government's first budget, which reduced wealth tax and corporation tax and spurned the best opportunity in years to harness wealth and combat economic inequality.</P>
      <P>The latest scandal has at last brought A.J.F. O'Reilly into the picture.  The economic empire of this man and his many companies in this country and abroad is unprecedented.  The latest revelations have touched only the tip of the iceberg of influence of the O'Reilly empire in Irish politics. An inquiry which could be usefully established by this House would consider Mr. O'Reilly's influence and role in Irish politics.  We know the many companies and newspapers controlled by this media mogul.  However, how many politicians does he also control?</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Caoláin and Deputy Jim Higgins allege that politicians are controlled by big business. A debate like this gives people the opportunity to grind their political axes, as they have been doing for many years.  Deputy Higgins, at least, has been consistent in his love of capitalism during the years.  I presume he was funded by Militant Tendency for a number of years before being elected to the House and funded by the taxpayer.

    <P>The letter went on to make further allegations regarding the Bovale controversy. Deputy Spring met the Taoiseach around this time to discuss his general concerns relating to the then unfolding Burke controversy.  He conveyed the contents of this letter to the Taoiseach <Col N="1196" /> and said that, as the letter was unsigned, he would take no further action on the issue.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach disputes this unreservedly.  The contents of the letter were not conveyed to the Taoiseach.  Deputy Quinn said that we should be careful not to mislead the House.  Where the Taoiseach has inadvertently done so he has always apologised, where necessary.  That is the manly thing to do.  I expect the politically correct to say that that is not a correct recollection of events.  Deputy Spring can assist us in the matter. The leader of the Labour Party does not appear to have checked with his former leader in relation to what he said last week, while the deputy leader of the Labour Party does not seem to be aware of the contents of the letter received by his leader today.</P>

      <P>I will make my contribution on my terms only.  I do not require the assistance of Deputy Higgins.  I have been a Member for much longer and know how to make my point.  The tactics employed might work with the Communist Party of Ireland but they will not work here.  We do not operate that way.  The Deputy should go and have a cup of tea with Derek Hatton or someone.</P>
      <P>The motion before us congratulates the tribunal on the work it is doing.  As a practising politician it is in my interest that everything should be cleared up in these matters.  We should leave it to the tribunal to deal with these issues.  That is what we set it up to do.  There were political opportunities for the Opposition to raise the heat on this matter, which it is now taking and fair dues to it.  When this House takes upon itself the right, by way of resolution, to seek to extend the terms of reference of this or future tribunals, subject to the consent of the then chairman of such tribunals, there is a responsibility on this House, despite the political attractions of not abiding by it, to allow the tribunal to deal with the issues of concern in the substance of any motion before the House.  Allegations have been made in relation to facts which are emerging and a certain interpretation has been put on those allegations.</P>

      <P>When this House sought to impose an extension of the terms of reference of a tribunal without referring that matter to its chairman, he quite rightly made it clear he would close down the tribunal if the Oireachtas unduly interfered in what are quasi judicial matters.  Members who talk about extending the terms of reference of the tribunal in the interests of transparency and accountability should be consistent.  They should respect the fact that the tribunal is independent and that the chairman has been delegated by this Parliament to deal with these issues in full.  No Member on any side of the House should try to delimit those issues which the Chairman wishes to enter into because it is in the public interest that they be dealt with.  Members will not hear me in Government or Opposition attempt to prejudge or seek to suggest wrongdoing has occurred before evidence has been properly adduced.</P>
      <P>People have constitutional rights, not too often taken into consideration here in the less than charitable comments made by Members during the course of this debate.  It is important that anything that is said here, albeit in a privileged assembly, does not in any way compromise the present or future activities of these tribunals or prevent them getting at the truth.  It is in all our interests that the full facts emerge.  Those who climb the high moral ground and seek to suggest, in a politically opportunistic fashion, that this constituency is theirs alone are going over the top.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a case to be made for extending the terms of reference.  The Government published a Bill this morning and incorporated in its notice, which amends the Opposition parties' notice, a provision that will allow that to happen, but it will be done in a measured way based on the best legal advice.  I reiterate to Deputy Howlin, a former Minister, and to any other Member that if it is suggested that the highest constitutional law officer in the land is not the appropriate person to liaise between this House and the chairman of a tribunal independently set up by the House at its request, who is?  To suggest that the Attorney General is a political animal or any previous holders of that office were is to do a grave disservice and injustice to his or their guardianship of the public interest.  I say that in support of all those who were Attorneys General during my time in this House.  It has become politically <Col N="1198" /> popular to use the Attorney General's office as a donkey that can be kicked around.</P>

Let the evidence show it has come from the Opposition on this occasion that the Attorney General's liaising with these two tribunals was said to constitute political interference, was unwarranted and wrong.

      <P>Now the racket has died down it might be no harm to return to the substance of what we are discussing.  It is about trust in politics, confidence in partnership and judgment in the appointment of members of Government.  To be constructive, I want to state unequivocally that when the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, spoke earlier he spoke in a way that is consistent with our investigation and construction of events.  He did not mislead the Dáil and what he said is on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the atmosphere in which this discussion is taking place.  Last weekend there was an extraordinary demonstration of bad temper by some of those who have been drawn into the conflict as to the fact that has arisen.  There will be another occasion to comment on that, but it rings somewhat hollow to be hearing lectures for some time about the egalitarian democracy we have and the constitutional rights of everyone to his or her good name.  I accept that, but no matter what wealth one possesses it does not remove one from the right to be questioned and answers sought on matters of great importance. A matter of great importance is what political culture prevailed when State assets were being allocated? That is important not only in respect of the past because these are matters of fact that must be investigated.  It is even more important for the immediate future when further decisions <Col N="1199" /> will be taken on the question of establishing competition.</P>
    <P>For some time I have been interested in hearing lectures about how the State has to get out of the way to create a free market and when I entered politics a long time ago certain churchmen used to object to being mentioned by politicians. Now there is a new kind of untouchable, those who are building a monopoly outside the State.  What we heard this afternoon about a position of dominance by an individual company is of utmost significance.  We can debate that on another day, but it was evident over the weekend that one is not supposed to raise questions about that fact.  Perhaps, because some of us come from different backgrounds, it is supposed to be irrelevant that one company controls 95 per cent of the Sunday newsprint, 66 per cent of the daily newsprint, ten regionals, had aspirations in the 1980s to add radio on to that and in the future will probably want a whack of digitalisation and services.</P>
    <P>In the heading of an editorial in the newspaper is the message that anyone who raises these questions is begrudging.  I would like to think the lectures we got on democracy and on the egalitarian republic in which we live regarded all our rights as equal and that any citizen is entitled to ask a question about the abuses of monopoly, the abuses of power and the appalling abuse of a dominant position, which the Tánaiste, in her speech, agreed exists.</P>
    <P>We as politicians hear comments about, for example, the payments to politicians tribunal.  It would have been much better if the politicians had been named because most behave honourably in every matter including the financing of their campaigns.</P>
    <P>When all the huffing and puffing dies down, the issues boil down to the Taoiseach's judgment in relation to appointing somebody to whom none of these controversies were new.  They also boil down to how quickly the facts, when they were discovered, were communicated to the partners in Government and the House and the forthrightness with which the matter was dealt.</P>
    <P>The response has been winkled out of the Government rather than being offered.  It reflects badly on those who state we have been making a great fuss about nothing.  If the Government had offered what the Opposition is now seeking, this debate would not be necessary.  However, it did not offer it.  Information has been knocked out of it.  A point with which perhaps all Deputies will agree is that politics has been damaged.  It is time to give serious consideration to this aspect.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to suggest that anybody on this side has anything but confidence in tribunals. However, revisionism will not manage to twist history to the suggestions some people are making now.  They are raising questions about whether Mr. Haughey was ever a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He was a member of that party as was Mr. Burke.  This matter should be put <Col N="1200" /> behind us but the Government has not offered anything.  The Opposition was forced to seek information which has been knocked out of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The crux of the debate is whether the Taoiseach is able to do his job properly. I am puzzled at his reaction when he was told in March that his ministerial colleague had been handed a second £30,000 donation.  I am puzzled by the Taoiseach's explanation that he had a two minute discussion about the matter, did not ask any questions and told nobody about it.  I am puzzled that the Taoiseach was not shocked.</P>
      <P>I do not believe he was not shocked and, therefore, I do not believe his explanation to the effect that perhaps he should have informed the Dáil and he did not take the matter seriously.  I believe the Taoiseach took the matter seriously and consciously decided to do nothing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is incredible, given all the Taoiseach had gone through over the original £30,000 donation to Mr. Ray Burke, that he would not have been shocked to the core when he heard that a second £30,000 had been paid over and that Mr. Burke had retained £45,000, not just a mere £13,000.  I cannot believe that the Taoiseach was not horrified when he heard it.</P>
      <P>I believe the Taoiseach did not tell his ministerial colleagues about the second donation.  The Fianna Fáil Ministers must ask themselves about the character of their Taoiseach if he did not tell them the explanations he gave the House were wrong and that a further £30,000 belonging to their party had been diverted into the pocket of an individual former ministerial colleague.  I do not believe the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, was told by the Taoiseach in March that he knew an extra £30,000 had been received.  I do not believe the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, was told in March as he should have been that a further £30,000 of his party's money had been diverted into the pocket of former Deputy Ray Burke.  I do not believe the Taoiseach told any of his colleagues, including the Tánaiste, about it. This is deeply serious.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the Taoiseach's explanation that he was busy with the peace process.  He has plenty of time to appear at three or four social events every night in this city and I do not accept that he did not have time to examine whether there was something wrong with a further £30,000 having been pocketed by a man he appointed to ministerial office less than a year previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the explanations given by the Taoiseach as to why that information was not passed on to the tribunal.  It has been suggested that the £10,000 was disclosed in response to an order for discovery and that in relation to such <Col N="1201" /> orders one can only swear what one knows as a swearable fact.  That is the case.</P>

      <P>Are you aware of any act or omission by any public representative which could involve corruption or involve attempts by threats, deception or otherwise to compromise the disinterested performance of public duties?</P>
      <P>This open ended question was addressed to the Taoiseach.  Yet, having found out that £20,000 had been given to Mr. Ray Burke, he did not answer that question.  He did not tell the tribunal what he had known since March about the £20,000.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that Deputy Bertie Ahern is fit to hold the office of Taoiseach in light of his gross failure to undertake proper inquiries when he first found out that a further £20,000 had been received by Mr. Ray Burke.</P>
      <P>I also draw the House's attention to the comments of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, which touch on the suitability of the Taoiseach's decision in originally appointing Mr. Ray Burke as a Minister.  The House was told that at the time Mr. Burke was appointed as a Minister by the Taoiseach he knew Mr. Burke had received the first £30,000.  He was satisfied it was fine and that there was nothing wrong.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach's judgment on that matter, but that is what the House was told.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has revealed that prior to that, Mr. Burke had been lying to Fianna Fáil.  Regarding his conversation with Mr. Murphy, the Minister said:</P>
      <P>I informed him that it was being alleged that different amounts including £40,000 was handed to Mr. Burke at a meeting which was attended by a leading builder.  I informed him that our party leader had during the election been questioned about this situation and that he had responded stating that he had spoken to Mr. Burke on a number of occasions regarding the persistent rumours and that Mr. Burke categorically denied any truth in them.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach when he appointed Mr. Ray Burke as a Minister knew that denial of those rumours by Mr. Burke was a lie.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Donal de Róiste or Donal Roche was a lieutenant in the Irish Army until 1969 when he was forcibly retired.  He entered the Army in 1963 dedicated to a career in the Army, his family proud that he was following such a career.  I am assured by him that he had no political affiliations and that is still the position.  I am also assured by him that he was at no stage a supporter of militant republicanism nor did he involve himself with any subversive organisation. He was in 1969 a lieutenant based in Athlone looking forward to a long career in the Army.</P>
      <P>From what is publicly known to date it seems as a young man Donal Roche made one mistake in the eyes of the intelligence section of the Army.  He enjoyed traditional Irish music and visited traditional music pubs.  He believes that this resulted in his being interrogated for several days by the intelligence wing of the Army concerning his opinions and the type of people he met at music sessions. He was never tried, charged or accused of any crime nor was he ever court martialled.  To his total shock and surprise he was simply told one day that he was being forcibly retired from the Army under Rule 47.2 of the Defence Forces Regulations, 1954.  He was never told why he was so retired nor was he given any opportunity to clear his name.  His treatment in the Ireland of 1969 could provide a storyline for a Franz Kafka novel.</P>
      <P>As everyone in this House knows, Donal Roche is the brother of Adi Roche who ran as a candidate in the presidential election.  Rumours about Donal Roche's background emerged during the course of the presidential election without the full story ever being known.  Donal Roche suffered greatly as a result of what happened to him in 1969.  The passage of time has not diminished that suffering.  The stories that emerged during the course of the presidential election rekindled the hurt and stress experienced by him.  He says that to this day he does not know why he was dismissed from the Army.  He wants to know what allegations were made against him and to be given an opportunity to refute them.  He wants the record set straight and to be given an honourable discharge.</P>
      <P>I have in my possession a letter from him dated 22 May 1998 in which he states &ldquo;I am granting you full permission to access and make public all the files on Ex-Lieutenant Donal de Róiste No. 08159 (1963-1969) and help clear my name&rdquo;.  I am asking the Minister for Defence to grant to me and to Donal Roche access to all information and files detailing each and every allegation made against him and the reasons the Government in 1969 recommended to the then President, Eamon de Valera, that he be dismissed from the Army.  I am asking that a person independent of Government and the Defence Forces be appointed to conduct an inquiry into this matter and that Donal Roche be given a full opportunity to refute all allegations made against him and vindicate his good name.</P>
      <P>Utimately an independent report should be published detailing the full background to what occurred, the manner in which Donal Roche was treated when interrogated by the Army and clarifying whether existing records prove misbehaviour by him which justified his dismissal and whether those records stand up to critical examination and to any response that can be furnished by Donal Roche or any other person prepared to give information about what occurred.</P>
      <P>From what I have been told, the treatment of Donal Roche by the State in 1969 was a flagrant injustice.  I am calling on the Minister for Defence to provide for Donal Roche a just mechanism which allows this issue once and for all to be properly addressed in a fair manner consistent with constitutional justice.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me I repeat the plea made by Deputy Shatter in support of this man's case.  The man's life was ruined by a number of faceless people who worked in what is lower than a kangaroo court.</P>
      <P>In a question dated 21 October 1997 to the Minister for Defence I asked the number of people who were retired from the Army between 1966 and 1997 and the answer I was given was three.  I asked the reasons for which an officer of the Defence Forces may be retired in accordance with the Defence Act, 1954, and a list of conditions were supplied, none of which fitted Donal De Róiste's case, apart from one which I question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donal De Róiste was dismissed in the interest of the service.  What was the interest of the service and what interest was at risk because of Donal De Róiste's presence in the Army?  He received 12 hours' notice to leave the barracks and, therefore, section 2 of the Act was not fulfilled. He had no opportunity whatsoever to defend his position.  He was asked to leave without an explanation and without a court martial. <Col N="1209" /> To answer those questions would not cost anybody in the Army their career, their reputation or their pension.  In a sense of generosity and openness the Minister should open the files to Deputy Shatter or to an independent investigator to establish the innocence of Donal De Róiste. His life has been ruined and he has been left with a question mark over his character by faceless people operating in what is lower than a kangaroo court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith) Michael Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the case raised by Deputies Shatter and Allen, it is appropriate to state our appreciation for the very fine manner in which members of the Defence Forces have carried out their duties through the years, often in very trying and difficult times.  For that reason I reject Deputy Allen's assertion of faceless people and kangaroo courts.  That allegation is far removed from reality.  All too often we fall into the trap of judging an event which took place many years ago by the situation and circumstances pertaining today. To do so is both unrealistic and unfair to the people who made the decision at the time given the circumstances which then existed.</P>
      <P>Ex-Lieutenant de Róiste was retired by the President acting on the advice of the Government with effect from 27 June 1969.  This was in accordance with section 47(2) of the Defence Act, 1954, which provides that an officer of the Permanent Defence Force may for any prescribed reason be retired by the President and subparagraph 18(1)(f) of Defence Force Regulation A.15 which prescribes that an officer of the Permanent Defence Force may be retired pursuant to section 47(2) of the Act, &ldquo;in the interests of the service&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the papers in this case and am satisfied that the matter was handled in an appropriate manner and that the decision was taken only after very detailed consideration.  A decision of this type is only ever taken for the most compelling reasons.  Given that this is a matter involving military security on which a decision was made by the President, I am not in a position to discuss it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for selecting this item and the Minister of State for coming to reply.  I commend Deputy McCormack on his work in this area to date.  It gives an indication of what could be done to alleviate the flooding <Col N="1210" /> problem in south Galway if the determination existed to do so.</P>
      <P>The report into the flooding in south Galway has already been dubbed the £1 million failure. Volumes of technical data and Office of Public Works jargon proved that nothing can or will be done by this Government.  A figure of £40 million as the final price tag indicates that nothing will be done during the lifetime of the Government. Will the Minister of State justify the costings that have been put on the suggested works to alleviate the flooding?  In so doing, he should bear in mind that the report puts a price tag of £350,000 on remedial works from Tarmon to Rathope.  These works were costed locally at £20,000.  The Minister of State may think that figure is not realistic. The Office of Public Works costed flood alleviation works from Kiltiernan to the sea at more than £2.5 million whereas the works were successfully carried out at a cost of £220,000.  That indicates the difference between Office of Public Works costings and the actual costs necessary to carry out these works.</P>
      <P>I deplore the Minister's failure to honour his commitment to provide the local action committee with the report prior to its publication.  He then added insult to injury by publishing the report by the unusual means of a press release.  I call on him tonight to name the date on which he will hold the public meeting in Gort to discuss with the local committee his proposals for the drainage works.  Furthermore, I call on him to declare that he will reintroduce the farmyard and farm house relocation grant scheme to assist the people of south Galway who have waited a long time for the publication of this report.  The Government must commit funding urgently, as promised in the run-up to the election last year, to provide remedial schemes to alleviate flooding and not condemn the people of south Galway to the fear of flooding for the remainder of their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed, but not surprised, at the findings in the report.  This study failed to find a solution to the flooding problem in south Galway.  It took two and a half years to compile a report at a cost of £1 million that represents the worst value for money spent in County Galway in my lifetime as a public representative. The only element of value in this huge report is the paper on which it is written because that can be recycled.  The report will not alleviate the flooding problem in south Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that £1 million had been made available to competent contractors, a flood relief scheme to solve the problem could have been undertaken. The English consultants, Southern Water Global Limited from West Sussex, will rest easily in their beds while the people of south Galway are condemned to ongoing flooding.  The report acknowledges that flooding will recur.  It makes only six recommendations, two of which are positive.  It proposes the implementation of planning controls within the 1995 flooded area and the protection <Col N="1211" /> of essential vehicle or access routes to the 1995 flood levels.  A ten year old child could have come up with those two positive recommendations.</P>
    <P>The report was deliberately negative and the cost of solutions greatly inflated to ensure nothing could be done.  It costed works from Caherglissane to Kinvara at £22.5 million and suggested another £1 million for a cost benefit study. That is similar in length to a scheme from Kiltiernan to Ballindereen and on to the sea at Killeen Aran which was completed at a cost of £225,000. That scheme involved five road crossings, 22 bridges and a channel taking the excess flood water five miles to the sea.  It relieved flooding from a number of roads, a national school, nine houses, a nursing home and the main Galway to Gort road.  It did not damage the environment because ecological control levels were maintained which ensured that only excess flood water was drained off and the winter turloughs were maintained.</P>
    <P>The scheme will prevent future flooding in the area and I challenge anybody from Southern Water Global or the Office of Public Works to find fault with it, but its success was not referred to in the £1 million report.  It is time we had action instead of costly excessive reports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McCormack and Burke for giving me the opportunity to explain to the House the exact details on the release of the report into the flooding in south Galway.</P>
      <P>The report was first commissioned in August 1995 and was expected to take approximately 20 months to complete.  Because the winter of 1996 was particularly dry, hydrological-hydrogeological monitoring had to be extended to May 1997 and the study was correspondingly prolonged. The objectives of the study were to quantitatively define the current flooding problem; to define the hydrological-hydrogeological processes; to assess the effects of climate change; to quantify and rank the environmental importance and economic value of the various turloughs, streams, land areas, wetlands etc; to propose engineering and other possible solutions and evaluate their economic costs, social, environmental and archaeological implications.</P>
      <P>The report has now been finalised and a copy is available for inspection in the Oireachtas Library and the branch library in Gort.  It is an extremely complex and extensive publication containing an enormous amount of technical data.  This is thought to be the largest interdisciplinary research study of a karstic environment undertaken anywhere in the world.  I reject the Deputies' comments about the report's value.  It will be of great benefit to future generations.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies have not taken the time to read it, they should do so.</P>
      <P>An executive summary of the report has also been produced and this document has been widely circulated.  Further copies are available if anybody is interested in acquiring them.  This document explains the principal conclusions of the main report.</P>
      <P>The commitment to hold a public meeting to discuss the report still stands, if that is what the people of south Galway want.  Rather than try to get everybody connected with the production of the report together &mdash; which would be very difficult as many of them are now working in different areas &mdash; I decided to issue the report and hold the public meeting when everybody was aware of its contents.  Officials from the Office of Public Works are currently trying to arrange a date that is acceptable to the consultants and all concerned. The earliest date on which most of the relevant people are available appears to be Thursday, 16 July and we are aiming to arrange a public meeting for that date.</P>
      <P>This is an independent report prepared by the consultants and all its findings, including the various costings, have been prepared by people with competence in the various fields.  The figure of £40 million is an estimated figure of the order of costs prepared by the engineering consultants for those civil engineering works identified by them and described in the text and drawings contained in the final report.  Without the benefit of further more detailed examination and preparation of separate designs for each solution proposed, it is not possible to give more definitive costings for these works.</P>
      <P>During the preparation of the report the consultants consulted widely with all relevant local interests, including the drainage committee and, indeed, have expressed their gratitude for the help and assistance received during the study. The information and data gathered in the report is likely to be of major benefit to many bodies. The wetlands of the study area consist of a range of turloughs, marshes and lakes unmatched anywhere else in Ireland or the world.  They include a remarkable selection of plant species and communities, many of them specialised to the habitat and rare elsewhere in Ireland.</P>
      <P>From the data collected it is also possible to take steps to minimise future flood damage costs. The worst affected properties have already been abandoned under the home relocation scheme. Road flooding can be greatly reduced by limited road protection works.  Any future applications for planning permission in the study area can be referred by the relevant planning authority to the Office of Public Works so that their proposed locations can be checked against the wealth of flooding data which has been accumulated as a result of the study.  This will ensure future dwellings and other buildings are not located in areas susceptible to flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report is a very complex document containing an enormous amount of technical data. <Col N="1213" /> Regarding its launch, I am satisfied the best course of action was to release it, allow people to digest its contents and then hold a public meeting where all the experts from the consultants can explain their respective aspects of the report.  I wish to acknowledge the extensive amount of good work which went into the various elements of the South Galway Flood Study.  This knowledge has not been lost, but has led to a greater understanding and appreciation of the complex geological, hydrogeological, and environmental nature of the area which comprises south Galway.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the Kiltiernan-Ballaghaderreen flood relief schemes.  The £225,000 scheme is a local flood scheme.  The Office of Public Works estimate of £2.5 million was for a more extensive arterial drainage scheme.</P>

      <P>The question I tabled to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands dealt with an issue that has arisen in RTE. She agrees the requirement in the 1993 legislation for commissioning from the independent sector has been good.  However, my question dealt with concerns about section 4(7) regarding circumstances which might arise which would give the Minister scope for response.  Specifically, the intention was always that the independent sector and the independent unit within RTE were two sources of creativity and both would benefit from interaction.  Section 4(7) enabled the Minister to take account of developments within RTE, particularly as they might affect employment. This is referred to in section 4 (7)(a)(ii)(1) &mdash; the employment or recruitment of staff by the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A figure of 20 per cent of £15 million was specified in the legislation.  In my question I sought the Minister's undertaking that she would exercise her powers under section 4(7) to establish a figure of £15 million for 1999 for two reasons.  Talks are ongoing between Film Makers Ireland and the RTE authority about the methodology of calculating the 20 per cent while a root and branch review of employment in RTE is being carried out and I was very anxious that the requirement to commission from the independent sector would not be used as a scapegoat for decisions <Col N="1214" /> that might be taken on employment.  For example, the situation arose where in order to cut costs RTE, having originally been reluctant to welcome independent film making, was now turning around to use the existence of the independent film making conduit as a means of eroding its staff, particularly short-term contract staff.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise it is that the Minister quoted three factors in her reply on 7 May.  She stated that to exercise her powers under section 4(7) would require an interpretation of section 4(8). Section 4(8) deals entirely with the authority's functions and its definition while section 4(7) deals with the Minister's powers.  Therefore, that does not stand up.  Her second point was it would be time consuming to make an intervention. Unfortunately, there is again a straight answer. The current and prospective financial liabilities of the authority are available in its published annual report.  The effect of the operations of the provisions of this section on the employment or recruitment of staff by the authority could be calculated easily.  It is a matter that would be clarified anyway by the root and branch review.  I simply sought a breathing space to allow an agreement on the methodology and until the review was over.</P>
    <P>The performance by the authority of its functions generally under the Broadcasting Authority Acts, 1969 to 1993, is included in the annual report.  The last reports on how the film commission worked are in the report that must be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas annually in accordance with the 1993 legislation. Again, the information is available from that source.  The employment of persons in the making of independent television programmes is also available in the report.</P>
    <P>The argument that section 4(8) is to be construed in terms of section 4(7) misses the point of the legislation.  Section 4(7) refers to the Minister's powers.  It does not ask, nor do I, nor did I ever ask, the Minister to interfere in the matter for the authority.  The matters of fact described as tedious or time wasting are available in the annual report and that of the independent production unit.  It was in an attempt to be constructive that I offered this so that the arrangement between the independent film making sector and the national broadcaster, which have an invaluable partnership, would not be damaged by the other in terms of, for example, the requirements under different legislation being made a scapegoat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  The Broadcasting Authority Act, 1993, places certain obligations on RTE with regard to commissioning programmes from the independent production sector.  Section 4 sets out the mechanism which RTE is required to operate with regard to independent commissions under the terms of the Act.  It is required to keep a special account and pay specific sums of money <Col N="1215" /> into it each year.  The funds in it must be used only for specific purposes which are commissioning the making of independent programmes as defined in the Act, procuring the formulation of proposals for commissioning of programmes and assisting the commissioning of programmes.</P>
      <P>Section 4(8) stipulates the amounts to be paid into the account each year.  Up to and including this year, specific monetary amounts are provided &mdash; this year the amount is £8.5 million.  From 1999 onwards £12.5 million or 20 per cent of television programme expenditure must be provided, whichever is the greater.  &ldquo;Television programme expenditure&rdquo; is defined in the subsection and it is a matter for the RTE Authority in the first place to interpret this definition.  Under the terms of section 4(7), the Minister has power, subject to certain matters, to vary the amount or percentage provided in section 4(8).</P>
      <P>In his question on 7 May 1998, the Deputy asked if I would use the powers in section 4(7) to respond to what he termed &ldquo;the employment consequences mentioned in the legislation&rdquo;, and went on to suggest that I set the level to be made available by RTE in 1999 at £15 million and that this level should prevail during the cost review being undertaken by RTE and while talks continue between RTE and Film Makers Ireland.  As I indicated in my reply on 7 May, invocation of the powers in section 4(7) is not as simple as implied by the Deputy in his question.  The subsection provides that in making an order, the Minister must have regard to each of the following matters: the current and prospective financial liabilities of the authority; the effect if any for the time being of the operation of the provisions of section 4 on, first, the employment or recruitment of staff by the authority, second, the performance of the Authority generally of its functions under the Broadcasting Authority Acts, and third, the employment of persons in the making of independent television programmes.  I am obliged, therefore, to give proper and objective consideration to each of the above elements if I am to contemplate invoking the power under section 4(7).  I cannot simply consider the effects of the section on RTE alone.  The work involved would be detailed and time consuming.  Each of the above elements would have to be assessed in a way which is and could clearly be seen to be even-handed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in the reply, I am concerned that, in the context of continuing disagreement between RTE and Film Makers Ireland, to exercise the powers in section 4(7) could be construed as an attempt on my part to interpret the provisions of section 4(8).  If I was to give any indication that I am prepared to act in the manner suggested by the Deputy, it could remove any prospect of agreement between RTE and Film Makers Ireland.  It is my preference that the interested parties should reach agreement themselves <Col N="1216" /> on the way the legislation should be applied in the circumstances obtaining today.</P>
    <P>In the present circumstances, while there is disagreement over the appropriate amount to be made available under the terms of the Act, l cannot see how I can meet the obligations placed on me under the terms of section 4(7) without appearing to usurp the functions of the Courts.  If I were to consider the effects of the operation of the section on the various matters set down in the legislation, I would need to start with an interpretation agreed between the disputing parties of the elements of expenditure that should be taken into account in determining the amount to be made available for independent commissions under the terms of the Act.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, could pass on to the Minister, Deputy Martin, an invitation to visit Rathcormac national school, which he passes frequently &mdash; it is situated about 50 yards from the Dublin-Cork road.  It would be worth his while to stop to see at first hand the poor physical state of the school and the urgent need for new permanent accommodation. The school manager, principal, staff, pupils and parents are at their wits' end to secure proper accommodation.  There is great and growing anger that the pupils have been dependent for so many years on prefabricated accommodation. The school structure is more than 50 years old and for 30 of those years many pupils have been accommodated in prefabs.  That is not acceptable, especially in 1998.</P>
      <P>The request from the parents, pupils and manager of Rathcormac school is for a permanent structure, including at least one classroom and a general purpose room and I hope the Minister of State will respond favourably.  When one considers that vast amounts have been spent over the years on prefabricated accommodation, which needs to be replaced every five years, we should have recognised by now that permanent structures, grant aided by the Department, are not only a better job but are just as economic in the long-term.  In 1998 we should put in place in Rathcormac what should have been provided years ago &mdash; permanent classroom extensions.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Bradford for sharing his time on this important issue.  As he explained, the prefab has been there for more than 30 years and is in atrocious condition.  There are holes in the floor, one of the internal walls fell down recently and, as one of the children said, &ldquo;the stuffing is coming out of the walls&rdquo;.  It <Col N="1217" /> is a health hazard on top of everything else.  I understand improvements are to be announced in the next few weeks and I hope this school is included because its inclusion is long overdue.  A 30 year old prefab is not up to scratch today.</P>
      <P>It is even more important to provide a proper extension because the population of Rathcormac is growing.  Contrary to the demographic trends some years ago, the population in our area is increasing.  That is likely to continue, because the tunnel and other improved facilities will persuade people to move out of the city.  That will mean an increased school population in years to come.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State communicate to the Minister, Deputy Martin, the urgent need to provide this new structure?  As Deputy Bradford said, he should visit the school some day when passing through the town, as it is just beside the main road.  He cannot miss it.  I am sure he has seen it often.  I hope this will jog his conscience and that he will have good news in the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputies have given me the opportunity to outline to this House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the provision of a permanent school building extension at Rathcormac national school, County Cork.  The school currently has a staffing level of principal, three assistants and one shared remedial teacher not based in the school.  There are ninety pupils enrolled in the school as of September 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school's existing accommodation consists <Col N="1218" /> of three permanent classrooms and two prefabricated classrooms which are reported to be in poor condition.  One prefab is used full-time as a classroom, the other as a remedial room.  It is predicted that the school's long-term accommodation need should cater for a staffing level of four teachers.</P>
    <P>The school management applied to the Department for grant assistance towards one additional classroom and a general purposes room.  A building project at Rathcormac is one of a number of urgent projects currently under consideration by the Department.  We expect the process will be completed shortly.  The Department will be in contact with the school management as soon as the matter is finalised.</P>
    <P>I will convey to the Minister the Deputies' representations and their invitation to visit the school.  If an official invitation is sent to the Minister by the school manager or the principal, who is also secretary of the board of management, the Minister will be only too delighted to consider it, as he is anxious to visit all schools throughout the country in the limited time available to him.</P>

      <P>I met Prime Minister Blair in Government Buildings to discuss a wide range of European issues in the run up to the European Summit in Cardiff on June 15-16.  Prime Minister Blair came to Dublin in his capacity as President of the European Council.  His visit forms part of his tour of EU capitals in advance of the summit.  I took the opportunity to welcome Mr. Blair on his first visit as Prime Minister to Dublin and I indicated my intention to ask the Dáil and Seanad to extend an invitation to Mr. Blair to come to Ireland in the autumn to address a joint sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Prime Minister said that he would be happy to accept.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister and I had a brief discussion before dinner when we took the opportunity to review the outcome of the referendums, both North and South, and looked forward to the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in a balanced and comprehensive way.  At the meeting which took place over dinner, the key items on the Cardiff agenda were discussed.  These included the Agenda 2000 negotiations, the broad economic guidelines for the Union and the national employment action plans.  Other issues covered were the progress being made in relation to the Union's policies on drugs and organised crime.  We also discussed EU enlargement and the shape of the Union, including the European institutions, in the new millennium.</P>
      <P>As regards the likely discussions at Cardiff in relation to the Agenda 2000 negotiations, I outlined Ireland's position on the Commission's current proposals on Structural and Cohesion Funds. I emphasised the need for generous transitional arrangements for Ireland under the Structural Funds.  I also restated Ireland's opposition to the current Commission proposals for CAP reform and the Government's intention to pursue real improvements on the terms on offer.  Finally, Prime Minister Blair and I exchanged views on a number of key international issues including the Middle East and Kosovo.</P>

      <P>The management and development of CIE's property holdings is a matter for the company and I have no statutory function in this regard.  It is my understanding that CIE does not propose to dispose of its property at the North Wall. Instead it is seeking to enter into partnership arrangements for the redevelopment of those lands which would enable CIE to retain ownership and generate an income from the redevelopment.</P>
      <P>Last November the Government agreed to the principle that lands in the docklands area owned by statutory bodies which were not required by those bodies for the purpose of performing of their statutory functions should, in general, be offered for sale at full market value to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  It was further agreed that alternatively the body concerned and the Docklands Authority could negotiate the terms of an approach under which they would become jointly involved in the redevelopment of the lands.  Discussions between CIE and the Docklands Authority are continuing in compliance with the Government decision.  The assessment of the market value of its property and of appropriate measures to maximise the income from it are matters for the CIE board.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware from the recent media coverage and my comprehensive response to a parliamentary question on 2 April 1998, following my success in having duty free sales placed on the agenda of the Transport Council of 17 March last, Ireland received a strong level of support at the Council.  As a result of this support, the President of the Transport Council sent a formal letter to the ECOFIN highlighting the concerns of the Transport Council and requesting that urgent action be taken in the matter.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, raised the issue at ECOFIN last week. He succeeded in bringing the French, German and Spanish Finance Ministers on side for the first time.  This is an important step forward and the message I wish to give is that the fight is not over yet.</P>
      <P>The House may be interested to learn that French Prime Minister, Mr. Jospin, has recently charged Mr. Andre Capet, transport Deputy of the Calais region, with the task of examining the implications of the scheduled abolition of duty free sales for France.  I am happy to add that I will be meeting with Mr. Capet on 24 June next to discuss the issue.  I firmly believe the campaign will gain more momentum as we approach the countdown to June 1999 and neither myself nor the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will be found wanting in our efforts to pursue the case at every possible opportunity, particularly in our endeavours to convince the larger member states to take up the running.</P>

      <P>I am aware that CIE has informed the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport that an investment of £650 million is required over the next eight years in the mainline and suburban rail networks.  CIE has recently submitted a review of mainline rail investment needs in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period.

The Forfás report entitled Broadband Telecommunications Investment in Ireland, published on 18 March 1998, called for &ldquo;an early sell-off of Cablelink to a company that would invest significantly in its development for the provision of broadband&rdquo;. The prime consideration in the sale of Cablelink is to ensure the upgrading of its network to enable it to become an important provider of a range of advanced multi-media services including digital television, internet, telephony and value added services such as data service, messaging, video on demand, video conferencing and interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.  Accordingly, the intention is that the sale should entail a commitment by the purchaser to upgrade the Cablelink network to a state of the art multi-media platform.</P>
      <P>A steering group has been established representing all the interests involved to manange the sale process.  This group is chaired by my Department and also comprised representatives from the Department of Finance, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, KPN/Telia &mdash; the strategic partners in Telecom Éireann &mdash; Telecom Éireann and RTE.  This Group is arranging for the full disposal of Telecom Éireann's and RTE's shareholdings in Cablelink through a trade sale process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale of Cablelink Ltd.  requires expert consultants to advise and assist in relation to the sale <Col N="1224" /> and EU public procurement procedures are being followed in this regard.  A notice inviting advisers to tender for this consultancy work appeared in the national newspapers on 20 May and in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 27 May.  Only a preliminary desk assessment has been made by my Department in relation to a valuation of Cablelink but a detailed valuation will be carried out by the advisers over the coming months.  It is planned to have advisers appointed by end July, 1998 and to have the sale process completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>While I have had no discussions with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation in relation to the decision to sell Cablelink, a number of licensing issues require clarification and are being addressed by my officials with the director's office in advance of the sale.  In addition, the policy with regard to the options for the transmission of digital TV services will require clarification in advance of any sale.  The Director of Telecommunications Regulation commissioned National Economic Research Associates in August 1997 to carry out a study on future options for the delivery of television services.  The report was completed in March of this year and the director initiated a public consultation process so as to inform her views on the key issues involved. Comments from interested parties were requested by 21 April 1998 and I understand the director plans to consult with me in the matter in the coming weeks.  I will then be in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who has a specific responsibility for digital terrestrial television.</P>

      <P>A proposal to extend the natural gas transmission network to the midlands and west of Ireland, serving Trim, Mullingar, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Galway, Ennis and Shannon, was drawn up in the early months of 1997. The economics of the proposal are such that it would not satisfy BGE's investment criteria.  In the circumstances BGE is not prepared to undertake the extension without the assistance of Exchequer funding of the order of £60 million. In May 1997 the then Government decided that further inquiries should be made in respect of the State aid aspect of the proposal before proceeding further with the project.  The necessary formal notification of the proposal was submitted to the European Commission last September.  The commission <Col N="1225" /> has recently indicated that it will not raise any objections to the proposal.  I am having a further look at the details of the project, in consultation with BGE, having regard to the current study of gas demand to the year 2025.  No provision has been made for Exchequer funding in 1998 for this project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, I recently announced that there will be an initial public offering &mdash; IPO &mdash; for the sale to the public market of a tranche of the State's shares in Telecom Éireann next year.  KPN/Telia, who acquired a 20 per cent stake in Telecom Éireann in 1996 for an initial payment of £183 million, have an option under the shareholder's agreement to acquire a further 15 per cent shareholding for £200 million by end 1999.  The final price to be paid for the initial 20 per cent and for the further shareholding of 15 per cent will be settled in the context of an IPO price.  IF KPN exercise its full option, the level of State ownership in Telecom Éireann would then stand at 50.1 per cent with the balance split between KPN/Teila &mdash; 35 per cent &mdash; and the employees ESOP &mdash; 14.9 per cent.  The planned IPO of a further tranche of State shares in the company will result in a minority shareholding position for the State.</P>
      <P>Preparing for, organising and executing an IPO is a major undertaking which will require expert consultants to advise on financial and other matters in relation to the share sale.  My Department has already advertised in the Official Journal for financial and legal advisers and it is expected that those advisers will be appointed by the end of July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of the advisers will clear the way for in-depth consideration to be given to the details of the IPO such as the number of shares to be covered by the offer, the structure of the offer and its precise timing.  At this stage, it is anticipated that the IPO will take place around mid-1999.  Preparatory work on the necessary legislative changes, including revision of the regulatory framework and corporate governance <Col N="1226" /> arrangement necessary to effect the IPO, are already under way in my Department and it would be my intention to bring proposals to Government for amending legislation in the autumn and, if possible, introduce such legislation in the Oireachtas before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I had extensive discussions with the unions in relation to the ESOP in Telecom Éireann.  In keping with the spirit of social partnership, it is my intention that the unions in Telecom Éireann will also be consulted on this matter.  The Telecom Éireann share offer next year will be the first offering of shares in a major public utility and I am confident that it will prove to be a great success for all the parties involved including the company itself, the employees as shareholders, the customers and the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 2 of April last, in reply to a priority question from Deputy Stagg, I set out the background to the EU Electricity Directive which must be implemented here by February 2000.  I would like to emphasise that my primary objective in implementing the new industry structure is to achieve lower prices while maintaining quality standards.  Above all, I want to ensure fair competition for all participants in the industry, including ESB.  The Directive requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition initially, increasing to about 32 per cent by 2003.  This will allow independent electricity generators to contract directly with eligible customers for the supply of electricity. Eligible customers will be those who will be free to choose their electricity supplier in the competitive market, and remaining customers will continue to be supplied by ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a widely representative electricity forum held in January last, my Department indicated its view that the holding of open tendering competitions for future large scale electricity generation might not be the best way forward.  The authorisation procedure is consistent with the approach being taken generally by member states in implementing the EU Directive.  It is also considered to be more consistent with the operation of normal market conditions.  No system is perfect <Col N="1229" /> and that is why we have engaged in such extensive public consultation on the subject.  On 15 May last, I published a consultation paper containing the legislative proposals for comment as a final form of public consultation before seeking Government approval for drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>These proposals are in the form of over 120 draft proposals, and it would not be practical to go into them in detail here.  Briefly, the new arrangements proposed include the establishment of an independent regulatory authority; separating the operation and development of the transmission system from ESB and placing it in a public limited company in State ownership; licensing the distribution system operation within ESB; licensing for ESB's generating stations and independent power producers; licensing of independent power suppliers to supply customers who will be eligible to choose their supplier, and establishing a licensed public electricity supplier within ESB to serve all other electricity consumers.</P>
    <P>Domestic consumers, while not eligible to &ldquo;shop around&rdquo; for their electricity, will benefit from the liberalisation of the market in two ways. First, the public electricity supplier will be under an obligation to purchase electricity in the most economical manner.  In this way, the benefits of competitive pressure on prices which I expect will result from new players in the market will be passed on to domestic consumers.</P>
    <P>Second, independent regulation of transmission and distribution charges, in addition to regulation of the final price for domestic consumers holds the prospect of increased efficiency in these sectors leading ultimately to lower prices. I have allowed until the end of this month for comment on the consultation paper and I expect to be in a position to seek Government approval for the drafting of a Bill in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995 provides a framework for the introduction of third party access to the Bord Gáis gas network. The Act provides that disputes arising between a person seeking third party access and Bord Gáis in relation to the reasonableness of terms on which the board has made an offer, shall be referred to the Minister for Public Enterprise is, therefore, in effect the regulator for the purposes of third party access to the BGE network.</P>
      <P>An EU Directive on common rules for the internal rules in natural gas was recently adopted by the Council of Energy Ministers.  One of the major effects of the directive will be the introduction of further competition for the gas industry in the form of third party access to gas networks throughout the European Union.  Member states are required to adopt the necessary implementation measures within a period of two years.  In the context of preparing legislation to implement the EU Directive, it is my intention to extend to the gas sector the remit of the regulatory authority being proposed for electricity.  The 1995 Act empowers the Minister for Public Enterprise to give Bord Gáis general directives concerning the transmission and pricing aspects of third party access.  In March 1998 I published two such draft directives and invited comments thereon.  Comments were received from a number of persons and bodies.  On 28 May 1998 officials of my Department met with those persons and bodies to discuss the various comments that had been submitted.  My officials are now examining the various comments and I will finalise the directives as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The proposed formula for calculating access charges in relation to third party access and the depreciation policy were published in the draft directives.  The principal features of the price formula are as follows: postalised capacity and volume charges, ten year cash flow model to determine revenue requirements, opening asset value, computed on the basis of historic costs, adjusted for changes in the consumer price index since acquisition and net of cumulative straight line depreciation and a real rate of return of 7.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>With regard to transparency, I propose to appoint consultants to carry out an audit of BGE's relevant assets and cash flow projections to verify the validity of BGE's computations of proposed access charges for third party access.  In addition I am considering to what extent details of the basis of BGE's proposed charges can be published having regard to commercial confidentiality constraints.  Charges will be subject to an annual review initially, pending the introduction of the provisions of the EU gas directive.</P>

That appointment will continue until such time as a new chief executive is appointed.  While the appointment of a new chief executive to Aer Lingus is a matter for the board of that company, I have been assured by the executive chairman that the selection of a suitable person to succeed to that position will be pursued as quickly as possible. I am not in a position to say how long that process will take.</P>
      <P>With regard to the future of TEAM Aer Lingus, I refer the Deputy to my replies to Priority Questions Nos. 17 and 18 today.</P>

      <P>In my role as Minister responsible for the communications sector, I have regular meetings with companies and organisations with an interest in the development of the sector.  In this regard, I have met with Mr. Denis O'Brien on three occasions in my office when I was accompanied by senior officials.  The liberalisation of the sector and the regulatory framework for competition would have formed part of the discussion on these occasions.  I have met formally with the board of Telecom Éireann on two occasions in the context of my role as shareholder and have met the chairman and other directors a number of times and again the derogation issue has been touched on in the discussions.  I have also discussed with both companies the need for Eircell and Esat Digifone to provide full information and opportunities for consultation to local communities about the roll-out of mobile telecommunications infrastructure.  I decided to bring forward the timescale for implementation of full competition in the telecommunications sector to later this year because this is transparently necessary to meet the needs of business for high quality cost effective telecommunications services.  The early implementation of liberalisation has been separately and repeatedly called for by IBEC, Forfás and the National Competitiveness Council.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that, on 25 March 1998, the Government announced its decision on the recommendations contained in Report No. 37 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  In so far as the pay of chief executives is concerned, the Government decided that the revised pay arrangements recommended by the review body in relation to the basic salary of chief executives of commercial State bodies should be modified. It was felt that, in the interests of greater co-ordination, any revised arrangements should apply to all such bodies and not to individual bodies on a piecemeal basis.  Accordingly, independent consultants were appointed by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to carry out an in depth review of the chief executive positions of all commercial State bodies.  The position in relation to the remuneration of the chief executive of Aer Lingus is included in that review.  When that work has been completed, the conclusions arrived at will be examined by the Government and decisions will be taken as to the appropriate rate for each such body.  I understand that the consultants are expected to conclude their work in the near future.</P>

      <P>As outlined in my reply to Question No. 21 of 2 April 1998, amending schemes were drafted to give effect to the necessary restructuring of CIE's salaried staff superannuation schemes.  However, during the course of the examination of the draft amending schemes by the Attorney General's office, legal technicalities were identified which necessitated considerable detailed attention.</P>
      <P>This process was almost complete when further legal complications arose.  These issues are being addressed by my Department and CIE as a matter of urgency.  I am not, therefore, in a position to approve the scheme until these legal issues have been resolved.  However, I can confirm that, irrespective of the length of time it takes to complete the arrangements for approval, the agreed terms of the new scheme include a provision for an effective date of 1 January 1994.  I fully appreciate the concerns of CIE staff and pensioners and I would like to reassure them that my Department will make every effort to resolve the matter as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Many new services, both passenger and freight, have been announced for Shannon this year and I am optimistic as to the future prospects of the airport and of the region which it serves.  The plans for the future development of Shannon Airport are well known.  Earlier this year, to cater for increasing passenger growth, I announced an increase from £23 million to £28 million in the five year capital expenditure plan.  This includes a new passenger terminal as well as additional developments to the airfield, including new runway lighting systems.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I have not been in contact with the British authorities on this matter nor has any request been made by my Department to the British authorities to make available their files.  I would like to reiterate the main points of the comprehensive reply I made to questions on this subject on 2 April 1998.  My Department carried out a thorough investigation into this tragic accident, the report of which was published in 1970 and a copy of which is in the Dáil library.  The final conclusion of the report was that there is not enough evidence available on which to reach a conclusion of reasonable probability as to the initial cause of this accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer my sympathy to the families of the victims of this tragedy and to the colleagues of the Aer Lingus crew.  It is always unsatisfactory when <Col N="1235" /> an accident investigation fails to establish clearly the cause of the accident.  I appreciate that it is particularly difficult for the families and friends of the victims of such an accident to come to terms with their loss.</P>
    <P>My Department has consistently done all that was possible to establish the cause of the loss of the Aer Lingus Viscount and more importantly the loss of 61 lives so tragically 30 years ago.  My Department has always examined any new information as it became available.  It did so on several occasions since 1970, including the examination of parts of target aircraft dredged up in 1974 and 1978.  However there was nothing found which could positively be linked to the loss of the Aer Lingus Viscount.  I am willing to republish the report of the investigation and its appendices and to make copies of these documents available in the Dáil library.  However, in the absence of significant new evidence, I am not persuaded to reopen the investigation.  Should such new evidence become available, I, like all my predecessors, would be more than willing to have such evidence examined.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for US and Irish airlines to decide whether to operate air services between the US and Ireland based on their own commercial judgment.  Of course both I and my Department avail of every opportunity to encourage airlines to extend existing services and commence new services to Ireland and indeed one of the priorities in the joint programme for Government is the opening up of a new air links with the US.</P>
      <P>Aer Lingus translantic services have increased considerably in recent years with the addition of new gateways &mdash; Newark and Chicago &mdash; as well as increases in capacity at existing gateways.  This year Aer Lingus is increasing its capacity on its transatlantic services by 13 per cent over 1997. For the first time ever, Aer Lingus will be providing over one million seats on its transatlantic services this year.  Currently Ireland has scheduled services to and from New York, Newark, Boston and Chicago provided by Aer Lingus and from Atlanta by Delta Airlines.  From mid June Continental Airlines will operate services from Newark.  This is a particularly welcome development.</P>
      <P>I understand from Aer Lingus that the airline has not yet completed its schedule plans for summer 1999 and has no plans at this stage to offer services to the US west coast.  This position is kept under review by Aer Lingus on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1239" /> I am aware that concerns have been expressed in the past about the lack of direct scheduled services from the west or south west of the US.  It should be recognised, however, that growth in airline alliances and code-share agreements, the increasing concentration on hubbing operations and in particular increasing capacity through existing hubs improves access to &mdash; from all US points.  Both Delta at Atlanta and Continental at Newark have extensive route networks in the US while Aer Lingus services to Ireland also benefit from interline traffic at the hubs of other major US airlines.</P>
    <P>I will continue to keep the situation under review in consultation with my colleague, Deputy McDaid, Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to have provision for funding made in the context of my Department's 1998 Estimates submission.  As part of the framing of the 1998 Estimates, discussions and correspondence did take place with the Department of Finance on a radon grant scheme. However, in the light of Exchequer commitments and overall budgetary constraints, it was not possible to make provision for such a scheme this year.</P>
      <P>While the Government is not in a position to provide direct financial assistance to householders in the current year, every effort is being made to address the problem of high radon concentrations in dwellings.  The Government is taking action on a number of fronts.  First, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; is continuing to concentrate considerable resources on its national radon survey which is aimed at identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels.  The institute's survey, which has been carried out in respect of 19 counties to date, is due for completion early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has recently published revised technical guidance documents relating to the consolidated National Building Regulations, 1997. The guidance calls for radon protection measures to be taken in the building of all new houses commencing on or after 1 July 1998.  More elaborate radon protection is specified for new houses situated in &ldquo;high radon areas&rdquo; ie., where the RPII <Col N="1240" /> surveys indicate that more than 10 per cent of houses exceed the national reference level of 200 becquerals per cubic metre.</P>
    <P>Third, the Minister for Education and Science has asked the RPII to carry out a comprehensive survey of schools to ensure that problems with radon gas are identified.  I understand the Minister will also assist schools in carrying out remediation measures which may be necessary as a result of the RPII survey.</P>
    <P>All of the above mentioned measures are indicative of the Government's efforts to tackle the problem of high indoor radon levels in dwellings.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Current requirements in relation to electricity generation are being adequately met.  As the Deputy may be aware, I have recently published a consultation document on legislative proposals for the implementation of the EU Electricity Directive 96/92/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity which must be implemented in Ireland by 19 February 2000. These proposals provide, <i>inter alia</i>, for the publication by the Transmission System Company of an annual statement estimating for a seven year period the generating capacity which is likely to be connected to the transmission system.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the new legislation and, as announced by me at the public discussion forum on the electricity directive held last January, I have asked ESB to prepare a statement of estimated future capacity requirements for electricity in consultation with my Department.  I understand that work on this is well advanced and I expect to be in a position to publish the statement during this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that there is strong interest in meeting future capacity needs in this country. ESB has recently sought my approval for capital expenditure to build a 350-400 megawatt combined cycle gas turbine power station.  In addition, both Marathon and Northern Ireland Electricity have expressed publicly their intention of building <Col N="1241" /> similar plant.  Other independent power producers have also expressed interest.</P>

      <P>As I outlined in my reply to Question No. 179 on 26 May, the Community Support Framework monitoring committee is the body with responsibility for making decisions on the reallocation of Structural Fund assistance decommitted from the light rail project.  I understand that the committee will consider this matter later this month.  My primary concern has always been to ensure that Ireland does not lose the EU funding involved and that objective will now be achieved through the timely transfer of this money to other suitable projects.</P>
      <P>Consultations have begun on the reallocation of the EU funds decommitted from the light rail project.  I will be working hard to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the EU funding decommitted from the light rail project will be used to address public transport requirements.</P>

On the basis of this work, separate meetings have recently taken place at official level between my Department and the Department of Finance and the European Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 101, 102 and 103 together.</P>
      <P>While the provision of services is an operational matter for CIE in which I have no statutory function, I am very much aware of the investment requirements on the Maynooth line.  Earlier this year I met representatives of the Dublin 15 Community Council who presented a very well researched case for investment in the line.</P>
      <P>The investment requirements of the line have been examined by CIE and by my Department in the context of EU funding.  From work done to date it is clear that there are three principal components to the upgrading of this service.  The first and most important is an upgrading of signalling in the city centre area to facilitate increased levels of service.  The other elements are an upgrading of trackwork, including the doubling of the line from Clonsilla to Maynooth, and the provision of additional rolling stock.</P>
      <P>Consultations have begun on the reallocation of the EU funds decommitted from the light rail project.  As I have previously indicated in this House, my Department has been working with CIE for some time to identify potentially suitable projects on the Dublin suburban rail network which could avail of the EU funding.  To avail of EU aid the projects must be capable of being contractually committed by end 1999 and work must be completed by 2001 at the latest.  The Maynooth project is among those which have been submitted for consideration in respect of the reallocation of EU aid.</P>

      <P>I have not had any formal discussions <Col N="1243" /> with the ESB group of unions about proposed price increases.  However, when I met the board of ESB on 22 April 1998 the matter was raised and I indicated that this was clearly a matter to be considered and decided by the Government.  I am satisfied that the spirit of partnership embodied by the CCR is alive and well in ESB.</P>
      <P>The previous Government, early in 1996 as part of the CCR, approved electricity price increases of an average of 2 per cent in 1996, 1.5 per cent in 1997 and 3 per cent in 1998.  The first two phases have been implemented.  These price increases were presented as a recommendation in the CCR Agreement.  They were accepted by the Government on the basis of certain projections supplied at the time by ESB which anticipated profits of about £30 million per annum over the period 1996 to 1998.  Based on actual results to date, ESB profits over the same period are expected to average over £150 million per annum.</P>

      <P>My Department commissioned an independent study on airport charges in 1995. The findings of this report undertaken by the Transport Studies Group of the University of Westminster, were in real terms, Aer Rianta's charges remained constant over the period 1985-87 and then declined by 19 per cent between 1987-95 due to the pegging of the charges at absolute 1987 levels.  The report compared charging regimes at some 50 European airports over the period 1990-95 and found that Aer Rianta's basic charges were significantly below the European average rates.  The recent Cranfield report, commissioned by the Association of European Airlines, also indicated that charges at Dublin Airport were below average.</P>
      <P>I should point out in respect of the growth incentive discount schemes introduced by Aer Rianta since 1994 that these discounts apply not only to new routes but equally to new traffic on existing routes and are available to all airlines.</P>

      <P>The Irish implementation of the Horizon strand of the EU employment initiative was independently reviewed through a mid-term evaluation conducted for my Department in 1997 by Fitzpatrick Associates Economic Consultants.  The initiative is used in this and in all other EU countries to support innovative projects aimed at finding new ways of upgrading the employment potential of several specific social groups at risk of mariginalization or exclusion.  The initial 1994 focus of the Horizon strand was divided between the disabled and socially disadvantaged. From 1997 the latter group was addressed through a separate Integra strand leaving the Horizon one focused totally on the disabled.  The projects supported <Col N="1246" /> under the initial call in 1995 which have now ended and those chosen for funding over the 1998 and 1999 period have involved a wide range of activities including training.  The implementation of the recommendations arising from the Fitzpatrick Associates report is continuing in conjunction with the various technical support units contracted to my Department to deliver the administration of the various initiative strands including Horizon.</P>

      <P>My Department is represented on the establishment group for the new National Disability Authority, set up by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in November 1997.  This group is considering, among other issues, the transfer of responsibility for appropriate training and employment services for disabled people from the Department of Health and Children to my Department.  The establishment group is expected to report to the Government during the summer, following which I anticipate that appropriate functions will transfer to my Department and to FÁS early in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later this year, FÁS will develop and implement an action programme for people with disabilities.  Targets will be set up and the implementation of the programme will be monitored. The programme will be supported by a pilot project &mdash; action for disability.  The aim of the project is to test and develop mechanisms to ensure <Col N="1247" /> greater numbers of people with disabilities enter FÁS programmes.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I requested IDA Ireland to submit proposals to me for encouraging the employment of greater numbers of disabled people in companies locating in this country.  I understand that the IDA already operates a voluntary code among its overseas sponsored companies by the inclusion of an exhortatory clause in a formal letter which accompanies letter of grant offers to companies.  This clause requests companies to give consideration where possible and appropriate, to the employment of people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, IDA Ireland is currently having in-depth discussions with a small number of overseas clients companies with a view to introducing a pilot programme to bring people with disabilities into the workplace.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to have the buildings of the Department accessible to people with disabilities.  In this regard, planning permission has been obtained and exploratory work has been carried out on the Kildare Street building, to make it accessible.  The actual construction work will commence without undue delay.</P>

      <P>Community Employment is an active labour market programme designed primarily to prevent marginalisation among long-term unemployed people whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or certain other means tested social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>The present eligibility criteria for community employment came into effect only in 1996 following a detailed review of the programme and have become much more targeted on the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Persons in receipt of a widow's pension can opt for a social assistance payment on the basis of which, as jobseekers, they could establish eligibility to participate in community employment. The balance of advantage, however, usually lies with retention of the widow's pension.  Widowed persons who wish to re-enter the labour force can apply to FÁS for an appropriate training course. A wide array of courses are available.</P>
      <P>The community employment programme is currently being reviewed independently, by Deloitte and Touche, and it is my intention to consider closely the recommendations contained in this review from the perspective of eligibility criteria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer Deputies to replies I gave to questions in the House on 26 and 28 May 1998 where I outlined the level of funding made available to the National Research Support Fund Board (NRSFB) over the period 1996 to 1998.  A <Col N="1249" /> detailed breakdown of the allocations is set out in the following table.  The overall allocation for research for 1998 represents a real increase while the amount of £2 million allocated for basic research is sufficient to cover existing commitments. As I have already outlined in the replies referred to above, £0.5 million has now been allocated to fund new basic research projects in 1998.</P>
    <P>The budget allocation for funding the programmes in advanced technologies has not been reduced to provide funds to support the basic research scheme.  The 1998 allocation of £11.2 million is an increase of £1.1 million on the original 1997 budget of £10.1 million.  During 1997, the programmes in advanced technologies received additional funding for capital expenditure, which brought forward funding which would have been required in 1998.  No single programme in advanced technology has received a £0.5 million cut in its budget.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the conservation, protection and development of eels in the Shannon region is primarily a matter for the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board.  The ESB is the owner of the fishing rights.  I have had inquiries made on the matter and I am advised by the ESB that no elvers have been stocked in Lough Key and Lough Gara since the mid-1980s.  The ESB has advised that its policy has been to allow natural upstream migration.  The ESB pointed out that a Europe-wide shortage of elvers affected <Col N="1250" /> recruitment in the Lower Shannon and the best scientific advice was the basis for its policy.</P>
      <P>The ESB also advises that an improvement in the recruitment of young eels was noted in 1997 and stocking will be extended to the upper lakes in 1998 if this improvement continues.  The ESB states that initial plantings will be in Lough Allen to be followed by other smaller upper lakes such as Loughs Key and Gara.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Water quality is a critical element in the protection of fisheries and the fisheries boards, under my direction, give a very high priority to ensuring its quality.  The fisheries boards undertake intensive water quality monitoring and actively pursue polluters.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Environment and Local Government also has specific statutory responsibilities for water quality.  He is currently spearheading a water quality management programme, which is being co-financed by the EU Cohesion Fund, for the River Shannon and all its tributaries from its source, north of Lough Allen to Killaloe south of Lough Derg.  Significant investment, amounting to more than £39 million, has been allocated to upgrade sewerage networks and waste water treatment plants, including phosphate removal at the main population centres. The local management of the projects under the programme are being carried out by operational management groups on which all of the local authorities in the catchment areas are represented, together with the central and regional fisheries boards, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Under this programme, a catchment monitoring and management system is being established for Lough Derg and Lough Ree.  Consultants were appointed for this work in 1997 and it is expected that approximately £2.3 million will be expended over three years in setting up the monitoring and management system.  The fisheries boards, local authorities, EPA, ESB and Teagasc are also supplementing this monitoring programme.</P>
      <P>In regard to the suggestion of a decline in the variety of fish species, I am satisified from inquiries with the Central Fisheries Board that there is no evidence of such a situation.  The Deputy may wish to note that as recently as nine months ago University College Galway, published the Lough Derg Coarse Fish report.  This report concludes, <i>inter alia</i> that the stocks of coarse fish in the lake had not declined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the ASEM vision group was established at the ASEM II summit held in London on 2-4 April this year following an initiative taken by the President of the Republic of Korea at the first ASEM summit in Bangkok two years ago.  The ASEM process is aimed at developing a comprehensive partnership between Asia and Europe.  In order to promote more fully the potential for enhanced co-operation, it was considered that it would be beneficial to pool the wisdom of those outside immediate government circles who could offer forward-looking and constructive ideas for the future progress of the process.  In this way, it is intended that a medium to long-term vision of future activities will emerge which will help guide ASEM into the 21st century.  This vision group which was established in London two months ago will review the present state of Asia-Europe relations and will make recommendations on measures that can advance a comprehensive Asia-Europe Partnership.</P>
      <P>The document entitled A Peoples's Vision to which the question refers offers suggestions and recommendations for the future development of the ASEM process.  I have no doubt this document will be considered with great interest by all members of the vision group, including the Irish representative on that body who is the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds has been appointed in his personal capacity as the Government's representative on the ASEM vision group.  It is accordingly a matter for his judgment how the important task with which he has been entrusted should best be carried out.  I have every confidence, however, that Deputy Reynolds will take into account the <Col N="1253" /> views of all relevant Irish organisations in contributing to the deliberations of the group.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>As we face into another marching season, and in the context of the resounding support for the British-Irish Agreement shown by the outcome of the recent referendum, I would urge those on all sides who are most directly involved in contentious parades to listen to the demand of the people for peace and mutual accommodation.</P>
      <P>The two Governments and the political parties reached agreement on 10 April last.  The people strongly endorsed that Agreement on 22 May.  It is now the responsibility of those involved in contentious parades to make their contribution to peace and reconciliation by reaching agreements through dialogue and mutual accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Parades Commission, now operating with full statutory powers, can play a valuable role in the search for a peaceful resolution to contentious parades.  As I stated in my reply to Parliamentary Question Nos. 21 and 53 on 28 May, the commission must approach its task in an even-handed way and its decisions must be seen to be impartial, fair and consistent with the principles of dialogue and agreement which <Col N="1254" /> underpin its approach.  The Parades Commission recently met the Taoiseach and had valuable discussions with Government officials.  I also understand the Commission met the representatives of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body on 29 May.  The Government welcomes all such dialogue and engagement as a significant contribution to a greater understanding of the issues underlying contentious parades.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will recall, last year &mdash; and in the wake of the traumatic events on the Garvaghy Road &mdash; the Orange Order voluntarily rerouted Twelfth parades away from key contentious areas.  Their restraint, and that of others, was welcomed by the Government.  I hope this year we can build on that achievement in relation to all contentious parades in Nationalist areas.</P>
    <P>The Government will do everything it can to encourage agreement and accommodation during this marching season.  We will continue our discussions with the British Government.  The Taoiseach and I recently met representatives of the resident groups from the Garvaghy Road in Portadown and the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast. In representations on these, as on all contentious parades, we will continue to emphasise the importance of local dialogue in the search for agreement.</P>
    <P>As we approach the most contentious parades in July, I anticipate that meetings and consultations among all sides will intensify as we search for a peaceful outcome to this year's marching season.  The Government will explore and exploit all opportunities to that end, including of course with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>A consortium of consultants led by International Risk Management Services, a UK firm specialising in safety and risk management were appointed on 27 March last to carry out a strategic review of rail safety.  I hope to receive their report at the end of September and I will then examine its recommendations as a matter of urgency.  The terms of reference for the study require the consultants to bring to my attention without delay any matter which, in their professional judgment, gives rise to such an unreasonable and serious risk that it requires immediate attention.  They have not made any such report to date.  In the light of this provision it was not necessary to incorporate any requirement for the presentation of an interim report in the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to this House I intend to publish the report when it is completed.</P>
      <P>In so far as investment in the railway network is concerned, CIE has recently submitted a review of mainline rail investment needs in the context of securing EU or other funding in the post-1999 period.  The paper identifies a requirement for further evaluation work, particularly an economic and financial appraisal of the proposed investment.

      <P>This will enable me to make recommendations to Government on overall railway investment needs taking account of the investment review and of the findings of the safety study.</P>

      <P>I will be working hard to ensure that a reasonable proportion of the EU aid decommitted will be used to address public transport requirements. My Department has been working with CIE for some time to identify a range of potentially suitable public transport projects which can be contractually committed by end 1999 and where work could be completed by 2001.</P>

      <P>In answer to the Deputy's question a copy of a chapter from my Department's recently published strategy statement which outlines current thinking on the issue of regulation follows.  As highlighted in this chapter the Department intends to complete a review of all regulatory issues identified therein.  Upon completion of this review proposals will then be developed for consideration by the Minister in 1998.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a regulator for telecommunications has already been established. The current EU Directive on Common Rules for the Development of the Internal Market of Community Postal Services and the improvement of quality of service requires member states to establish a national regulatory authority for the postal sector.  The framework within which the national regulatory authority will operate is set out in the directive.  The deadline for the transposition of this directive into Irish law is February, 1999.</P>
      <P>A consultation document detailing legislative proposals for the implementation of the EU electricity directive was issued by my Department last month.  The new arrangements provided for in the proposed legislation include the establishment of a independent regulatory authority for the electricity industry.  In due course the remit of this authority may be extended to include the regulation of the gas sector when the gas directive comes to be implemented.  The logic for having both industries regulated by the same body stems from the desire to have a coherent view taken of the regulation of the energy sector as a whole as a well as the relationship between the use of gas and electricity generation.</P>
      <P>The long-term requirements for regulation of the transport sector are not yet fully apparent. However, developments such as emerging regulatory legislation at European level on airport ground handling services and airport charges and the possibility of further initiatives for public transport liberalisation may bring additional regulatory requirements.  The question of regulation in these areas will be examined as necessary.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Introduction</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since the last Statement of Strategy was issued in February 1997, the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation (ODTR) has been established.  While the establishment of the ODTR is a major milestone in the regulation of a specific industry in Ireland, regulation for all the other sectors coming within the Ministerial ambit still remains with the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" />
      <i>Regulatory Objectives</i>
    </P>
    <P>Whether regulation is carried out by arms-length independent regulation such as the ODTR or, indeed, by the Department, there must be a coherent regulatory policy framework established by the Department.  Such a policy framework must be based on the following principles:</P>
    <P>&mdash; protection of consumers</P>
    <P>&mdash; promotion of competition and market efficiency</P>
    <P>&mdash; equality of opportunity for market entry for all operators</P>
    <P>&mdash; price control</P>
    <P>&mdash; maintenance of service standards</P>
    <P>&mdash; consistency and predictability</P>
    <P>&mdash; enforceability.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Immeanna Rialacháin</i>
    </P>
    <P>&mdash; cosaint an tomhaltóra</P>
    <P>&mdash; íomáocht agus margadh éifeachtach a chur chun cinn</P>
    <P>&mdash; comhionannas i ndeaseanna tosú sa mhargadh</P>
    <P>&mdash; srian ar phraghasanna</P>
    <P>&mdash; caighdeáin sheirbhíse a chóimead</P>
    <P>&mdash; comhsheasmhachta agus inphreideacháide</P>
    <P>&mdash; Inchurtha i bhfeidhm</P>
    <P>
      <i>Protection of Consumers</i>
    </P>
    <P>As long as markets are supplied by monopolistic or dominant suppliers, there is an imbalance of power between the service suppliers and that of their customers.  While any regulator must recognise the underlying economic realities faced by operators, it will not be credible or acceptable unless it is seen as the defender of consumers, particularly small consumers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Promotion of Competition and Market Efficiency</i>
    </P>
    <P>In open modern economies, regulatory issues tend to be more prevalent in those markets that are not fully open to competition. Regulatory frameworks developed to cater for newly liberalised markets should be equipped to promote competition and remove unnecessary barriers to market entry.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which a regulatory framework can promote competition.  Policing markets is an intrinsic part of the comprehensive competition legislation already in place and which will continue to apply to the transport, energy and communications sectors.  For example, competition legislation already provides guidelines on horizontal concentration in the market place and abuse by dominant players.</P>
    <P>Regulatory policy should facilitate the entry of new players into the market place.  Such entry will reduce concentration and lessens the need for competition by regulation.  Indeed, once effective competition takes hold of a sector, regulation may be reduced to a lighter touch, as the dynamic of the market place provides the best guarantee of choice for consumers and market efficiency.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equality of Opportunity for all Operators</i>
    </P>
    <P>A key consideration for sectors where enterprises have ownership and control over basic infrastructure is how regulation can cater for a new market entrants and potential competitors. For those sectors for which the Department has responsibility, access by new market entrants to backbone infrastructure at reasonable and cost-related prices will be a key criterion in assessing the effectiveness of regulation. Drawing up and enforcing fair and equitable rules is a major task for any regulator.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Price Control</i>
    </P>
    <P>Price control is a straight admission that the market is not sufficiently developed to place confidence in its ability to price goods and services in the most effective way.  Whilst price control is a less attractive option, it is necessary where natural monopolies have to be regulated.  There is, for instance, no practical or ready alternative to a high voltage electricity grid; the development of a parallel high voltage transmission grid would inevitably lead to a higher cost burden being placed on the whole economy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" />In the absence of competition, prices have to be determined by regulation.  The basic ways of effecting price control are price caps, rate of return controls or a hybrid of these two. The empirical evidence worldwide is not decisive in opting for any one method.  Price caps can put a premium on short to medium-term efficiency but could do so as the expense of long-term investment and therefore effectiveness.  Rate of return formulate may guarantee long-term capacity but put a lower premium on efficiency incentives for the operators in the field.  The Department will continue its own research on the most appropriate policies that will yield price control mechanisms best suited to the Irish market place.</P>
    <P>Where effective competition takes hold, there will be less and less need for price control.  The sooner the market place reaches the level where formal price control can be dropped, the better.  Experience in other countries has shown that price control tends to become a &ldquo;cat and mouse game&rdquo; between the regulator and the regulated.  The latter has a far better knowledge of the market place both present and future while the regulator, knowing that this is the case sometimes over compensates by setting the bar too high for the dominant player in the sector.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Maintenance of Service Standards</i>
    </P>
    <P>The interaction between regulation and standards of service to be provided by a regulated industry is vital.  In certain sectors poor service quality by a State monopoly might have arisen because, in the allocation of scarce resources, it might not have been possible for Government to provide sufficient investment.</P>
    <P>The first recourse in regulation where there is a former monopoly utility or a dominant company is price control.  If service quality is not given sufficient weighting by a regulatory process, there is a real danger that regulated companies subject to price controls may seek to make more profits by reducing the quality of their service.</P>
    <P>Regulators must set demanding and achievable service standards whilst, in response, industry players should focus on standards of service and customer relationships.  The temptation to set targets that are too ambitious should be avoided. Standards should not be set in stone but should be evolutionary so that changes in technology and customer demands can be met.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Consistency and Predictability</i>
    </P>
    <P>The consistency and predictability of the regulatory system is essential for the effective development of competitive sectors.</P>
    <P>Regulatory decisions and acts must be predictable so that industry players can plan for the future with confidence.  So called &ldquo;regulatory roulette&rdquo; should be avoided at all costs since it introduces uncertainty and presents a barrier to further investment and entrance into the industry.  Such uncertainty is unlikely to be consistent with the regulator's role in promoting Government's sectoral and national economic objectives.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Enforceability</i>
    </P>
    <P>Regulatory regimes will only be effective if they are enforceable. This means that the regulator must have the power to ensure that existing directives and rules, together with regulatory decisions, are complied with by industry players.  In addition, the regulatory must be empowered to impose appropriate penalties where this does not happen.  Such penalties must reflect the financial scale of the industry, the players concerned and the specific issues at hand.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the Department intends reviewing existing legislation governing the penalties which may be imposed on industry players who fall to comply with EU Directives.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Regulatory Structures</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Structúir Rialacháin</i>
    </P>
    <P>As indicated earlier, an independent regulatory function has now been established for the telecommunications industry. Where it is decided to establish an independent regulatory structure for other industries, the following three options will fall to be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industry Specific Regulation</i>
    </P>
    <P>This involves establishing separate regulators for each industry, such as electricity, gas etc.  The argument in favour of industry specific regulators are that the regulator should have <Col N="1260" /> specialised industry knowledge and that creative diversity allows different regulators to experiment with different approaches.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sector Specific Regulation</i>
    </P>
    <P>This option involves the establishment of a single regulator for the sector, such as energy.  The proponents of this model argue that it would reduce the likelihood or regulatory capture, facilitate cross comparisons and take account of natural relationships between industries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Multi-Sectoral Regulation</i>
    </P>
    <P>There can be economies of scale in combining the regulatory functions for a number of sectors such that this can be a more cost effective structure.  The learning curve is reduced as more sectors are added.  In addition, there is greater scope for cross industry and sectoral comparisons and for consistency in dealing with different industries and sectors.</P>
    <P>If the sector specific or multi-sectoral options are chosen, the implications of the decision for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation (ODTR) will have to be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Department will also assess whether the appointment of individuals as regulators is the most effective regulatory structure.  There are other options including the establishment of regulatory commissions or boards where decisions are taken on a collective basis.</P>
    <P>Whatever structures are selected, the Department will ensure that the regulation of each industry and sector will also recognise the overall role and responsibilities of the Competition Authority.  In addition, there are instances where specific industries are subject to control by a number of regulatory authorities.  The Department will work with other Departments and agencies to streamline these arrangements in the near future.</P>
    <P>In the medium term, the emergence of global operators in some of the industries/sectors will increasingly constrain the remit of national regulators, so that the roles of EU regulatory authorities and those of other large trading blocs will become more important.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Accountability of Regulatory System</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Freagracht as Córas Rialacháin</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because of the impact that regulation has on vital areas of the economy and the effect it has in many instances on every household and citizen in the country, proper accountability for regulatory decisions and regulatory policies is essential.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the regulatory framework rests with the Minister and its implementation is a responsibility of the Department or independent regulation where this is provided for by law.  The Minister and the Department are accountable to the Oireachtas and this has been a feature of regulation in Ireland until very recently.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the ODTR has ushered in a new regulatory paradigm.  While the legislation provides for the accountability of the ODTR through the Minister to the Oireachtas, the accountability arrangements provided for in statute law may be such as to give rise to the perception of a &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;.  This issue will be carefully examined in the Department. Any further extension of independent regulation will be framed in such a way as to provide clear-cut avenues of accountability that will meet exacting standards without compromising the essential nature of regulatory independence.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options for avoiding a &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;.  For instance, regulators could be appointed by Government but be removed only by the Oireachtas.  Regulators could be required to present annual reports to the Oireachtas.  These accounts could be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General who would also have the power to carry out value for money and similar examinations.</P>
    <P>In addition, regulators could be legally accountable to the most relevant Oireachtas Committee and could be brought within the remit of the Ombudsman.  Regulators could be required to give written reasons for their decisions and a consumer council could be empowered to produce reports on the impact of regulation.</P>
    <P>Regulators could and probably should be brought within the ambit of the Freedom of Information Act.  In any event, decisions by regulators may be appealed to the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" />
      <i>Public Service Obligations</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>Oibleagaidaí Sheirbhisí Poiblí</i>
    </P>
    <P>A public service obligation is an obligation imposed by Government to provide a defined level of service which the commercial operator would not choose to provide.  The funding burden of such obligations can either be met by Government directly or by all operators collectively, which ultimately means either all taxpayers or all consumers.  Quantifying and funding this obligation is a major challenge for regulatory policy.</P>
    <P>In the past the concept of public service obligation was associated with public ownership.  Because public service obligations were, historically, met by monopoly utilities in State ownership, it was natural to equate the two.  Public service obligations may also be provided for by operators not in State ownership.</P>
    <P>Public service obligations often suffer from a bad press. They are seen as burdens on the former monopoly incumbent rather than a market opportunity to be exploited.  In some cases, only the incumbent company has the scale and capacity to continue to meet the public service obligations.  Where this is not the case, the obligations could be put out to tender.  The market could then put an accurate price on the obligations inherent in delivering such services.  Public service obligations arise where Governments decide that they are necessary in the maintenance of regional equality and social equity.  They are not, however, absolute standards set in stone.  Changes in technology will inevitably, require standards to be adjusted. The Department will attempt to anticipate and plan for changed standards within public service obligations.  It is, of course, for the Minister to propose when changes are required and to lay down the new standards.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Department intends to complete a review of all regulatory issues identified in this chapter.  Proposals will be developed for consideration by the Minister in 1998.</P>

      <P>My fundamental concern is that competition in the Irish market work to the benefit of all consumers, be they residential or business, large or small.</P>
      <P>Activity in the telecommunications sector in Ireland has risen very sharply in recent years driven by the twin forces of liberalisation of the sector and strong underlying growth in the economy generally.</P>
      <P>The telecommunications market in Ireland comprises a series of different areas of service and infrastructure provision each of which is subject to varying levels of competition.</P>
      <P>Some areas, such as value added services have been subject to competition for many years. Others such as mobile public services and telecommunications infrastructure have been liberalised more recently.  In addition, certain areas of the sector are subject to constraints on the number of competitors imposed by radio spectrum constraints and others are not.</P>
      <P>Only voice telephony and the provision of the underlying public network are still subject to a monopoly.  My recent announcement of the ending of the derogation on voice telephony and public network infrastructure by the end of this year will accelerate competition in the provision of telecommunications services and infrastructure in the Irish market.</P>
      <P>Over the past year I have focused on ensuring the transposition into Irish law of the EU framework for competition in telecommunications.  The transposition of these measures has been a prerequisite for the development of a clear and level playing field for competition in Irish telecommunications.</P>
      <P>I intend, in consultation with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, to review the development of competition in the Irish market on an ongoing basis with a view to ensuring that all legislative and policy initiatives taken by me are aimed at ensuring the best possible deal for Irish consumers in the liberalised market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement released by Greenpeace last week highlighted the existence of elevated concentrations of the radionuclides americium-241, caesium-137 and cobalt-60 in seabed sediment in the vicinity of Sellafield's discharge pipe.  I have consulted with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland who have advised me that their marine monitoring results for 1997 indicate that comparatively small levels of caseium-137 and americium-241 have been detected in sediments in Irish coastal waters.  No cobalt-60 was detected.  While the levels of these radionuclides are significantly lower on this side of the Irish Sea, it is highly objectionable that the contamination of our marine environment should result from the operation of nuclear installations in another State.  The findings have value as added evidence in support of Ireland's opposition to these discharges.</P>
      <P>The RPII have advised me that the Greenpeace findings, while of considerable interest in themselves, do not have direct bearing on the risk to people in Ireland from the Sellafield discharges. This risk is determined by data from our own coastal waters and from fish landed at Irish ports.  On the basis of such data, derived from their own measurements, the RPII consider that levels of radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea, do not justify misgivings on health grounds about eating fish from the Irish Sea, or about swimming or engaging in any other activity in or near the sea along the east coast of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that I met with Greenpeace on 28 May, last to discuss our shared concerns about discharges from Sellafield.  At that meeting I explained that I would be pressing the Irish Government's case for the ultimate elimination of these discharges at a meeting of the OSPAR Commission next July.  Ireland, supported by Denmark, Norway and Iceland has been to the forefront of discussions relating to the formulation of an appropriate strategy to guide the future work of the OSPAR Commission. Indeed, we have tabled a number of amendments to the strategy aimed at strengthening the text.  I wish to assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to play an active role within OSPAR and other international fora, pressing for our ultimate aim of eliminating the discharge of radioactive substances into the marine environment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111, 112, 126, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>My responsibility for such animals relates to the animal-health conditions governing their importation, which are fully enforced.  From an animal welfare viewpoint, the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, govern the welfare of all animals, domestic or wild, and the Garda Síochána are responsible for their enforcement. The question of legislation specifically covering exotic or dangerous wild animals involves a number of different Departments as the issue is basically one of public nuisance and danger to humans.  My Department has already proposed and will pursue the setting up of an interdepartmental committee to agree future policy.  Officials of my Department met representatives of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recently in relation to exotic and dangerous wild animals.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 14 animals under the deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme in April 1998.  One of the animals applied for, tagnumber YRA499108, was not paid special beef premium and, therefore, cannot be paid deseasonalisation slaughter premium.  The remaining 13 animals have been processed and payment will issue over the coming week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named applied for the following <Col N="1268" /> special beef premium applications: ten animals on the ten month special beef premium scheme on 3 December 1997, and 15 animals on the 22 month special beef premium scheme on 3 December 1997.  Under EU Regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density of two livestock units per hectare applies based on forage area declared in an applicant's area aid application.  The person named declared 42.22 forage hectares on his area aid application and, therefore, was entitled to payment on a maximum of 84.44 reckonable livestock units.  Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by the applicant for special beef premium, suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes coupled with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held.  The milk quota declared on the area aid application represents the following livestock units: 77,574 divided by 897 gallons, which equals 86.48 livestock units.  Therefore, as the full amount of livestick units has been utilised by the person's milk quota, unfortunately no payments can issue under the special beef premium schemes.</P>

Under EU Regulations governing the special beef premium scheme, a stocking density limit of two livestock units per hectare applies based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application.  The person named declared 14.02 forage hectares on his area aid application and, therefore, was entitled to payment on a maximum of 28.04 reckonable livestock units.  Reckonable livestock units consist of animals submitted by the applicant for special beef premium, suckler cow premium and ewe premium schemes coupled with notional livestock units derived from any milk quota held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named applied for premium on 120 ewes &mdash; 18 livestock units &mdash; under the ewe premium scheme.  The balance of the livestock units available was 10.04 units, because 28.04 minus 18 equals 10.04. These were utilised under the Special Beef Premium scheme as follows: 14 animals multiplied by 0.6 equals 8.4 livestock units, and 2.733 animals, multiplied by 0.6 equals 1.64 livestock units.  The EU Regulations governing this scheme specifically provide that animals applied upon in excess of the individual farmers permitted stocking rate of two livestock units per hectare are deemed to have been paid the instalment <Col N="1269" /> applied for and specifically precluded from qualifying for that instalment of the premium at a future date.  Therefore, there is no discretion in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 123, 124, 125 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>Each of these questions is related to different aspects of a particular application under the REP scheme.  The applicant in question, having applied for a second year payment, was selected at random for a pre-payment inspection control check my Department is required to carry out under the scheme.  As a result it was evident that the applicant was, under lease, farming seven hectares of land previously farmed by her spouse and located some ten miles away from her residence together with 33 hectares of leased commonage, to be stocked with a maximum of four horses, located some 56 miles away from her fenced land.</P>
      <P>Under REPS there is a 40 hectare limit on payments to farmers.  There are appropriate provisions to ensure compliance with this limit, to avoid the creation of split holdings and to ensure that farmers, in particular family members, are farming separately.  To this end, under the terms and conditions of REPS the term &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; means a person or group of persons or body corporate deemed by the Minister to be engaged in the practice of farming and the term &ldquo;farm&rdquo; means the total area of land whether owned, leased jointly or singly, or otherwise worked in one or more parcels for the purposes of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> It is further provided in the terms and conditions of REPS that, applicants may be deemed to be farming as a single unit where they share some or all of the following characteristics &mdash; farm ownership, management, farm dwellings, herd numbers, IACS returns, farm accounts or tax returns.</P>
    <P>The applicant in this case was asked for evidence of her claim to be farming separately from her spouse.  In response she provided joint farm accounts and joint assessment tax returns in support of her claim to be farming separately from her husband.  An examination of these showed that in the year 1994, prior to her spouse joining REPS, her farm enterprise generated some £188 towards the overall farm profit of £13,402 including some £9,209 in EU related payments.  That year the applicant's spouse included in his area aid application to my Department the seven hectares of land which the following year was leased by the applicant for inclusion in her REPS application.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the following year, the applicant's spouse joined REPS and her farm was constituted. That year her farm enterprise contributed some £301 to the overall farm profit of £13,356 including £13,561 in EU related payments of which REPS made up £6,053.84.</P>
    <P>In 1996, when the applicant joined REPS, her sole income seems to have comprised REPS payments of £6,054.  That year the overall farm profit was £15,547.  However, EU related payments for the year amounted to some £20,315 including the REPS payments.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances my Department concluded that the applicant and her spouse were farming jointly and were involved in the splitting of a farm previously worked as a unit.</P>
    <P>Applicants for REPS may submit any relevant information in order to substantiate their applications. The question of having accounts jointly assessed is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The REPS appeal board examines all appeals on the basis of compliance with the Department's agri-environmental specifications.  The chairman is completely independent of the day-to-day operation of REPS and the inspection process. The two other members, one administrative and one professional must, of necessity, be very familiar with the detail of the agri-environmental specifications to enable the committee operate effectively.  I am satisfied that the board operates an even-handed approach to appeals.  Of the 228 appeals heard to date, 81 have been upheld, 24 significantly reduced and 123 rejected.  I have no plans to make changes in its operation.</P>
    <P>The REPS conditions do not set specific income or trading levels for eligibility.  However, the Minister has discretion to accept or reject plans and in so doing he takes into account such matters as non-stocked or minimally stocked-cultivated farms, income or volumes of trading. Stocking density figures are not available in a way that would enable them to be extracted other <Col N="1272" /> than on a file by file basis which would not be feasible.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for departmental schemes does not require the applicant to have a bank account. However, many participants have requested that payments be made directly to their bank account.</P>

      <P>I fully recognise the importance of the live cattle export trade to Irish farmers.  I am engaged in an ongoing way in assisting the development of this trade by maintaining existing outlets, seeking to ensure the resumption of supply to traditional markets and encouraging the opening of new markets.  I have recently visited the Lebanon, which has emerged as a new market for Irish cattle.  In this connection I am in regular contact with various bodies representing those having an interest in developing the live trade.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of the transport of live animals to the continent, the Deputy will be aware that, following the declared withdrawal by Pandoro in 1997 from the carriage of livestock, I sought and obtained Government approval for a once-off State aid of £1 million to assist in the start-up of a ferry service between Cork and Cherbourg to facilitate animal exports to continental European markets.  This service was of great value during the critical winter months last year.  This State aid is now the subject of an examination by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The provision of a further ferry operation over and above the existing services and which would be committed to the carriage of livestock to export markets is, in the first instance, a matter for commercial interests to evaluate.  I understand that such interests are now examining the options available in that regard.  I will continue to give every appropriate encouragement and assistance to them in their deliberations.</P>

      <P>The current number of staff &mdash; full-time equivalents &mdash; assigned to the brucellosis laboratory in Cork and on blood testing duties in the regional veterinary laboratory in Sligo is 65.  This represents an increase of 25 above the normal complement due to the engagement of additional temporary staff and the transfer of staff for short periods from other areas to cope with the huge volume of blood samples being received as a result of the implementation of this year's intensive regime of testing.</P>
      <P>The blood testing work undertaken at the regional veterinary laboratory in Sligo is designed to facilitate a quick turnaround of results for those engaged in the export of female cattle. While the Department has no proposals to upgrade the blood testing facilities in the Sligo laboratory, it is proposed to maintain the current arrangements and replacement staff are being assigned to fill temporary vacancies arising there.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct information which I gave in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 119 on 12 May last in relation to the number of blood tests being processed in the Sligo laboratory.  That information was based on statistics for the early part of this year but did not reflect the significant increase in throughput during March and April and which continued into May.  The actual number of tests processed each month this year in this laboratory is as follows:</P>

      <P>The scheme of assistance for weather related crop losses in 1997 was targeted at a small number of cereal and other crop growers whose main source of income was from arable crops, potatoes, horticultural crops and grass seed, and whose crop losses arising from the severe weather conditions in 1997 seriously threatened the viability of their farms.  Because of the limited funds available only those farmers who had no other significant source of income were eligible for assistance.  Fodder crop losses incurred by the <Col N="1275" /> person referred to did not come within the primary scope of the scheme and danger to the viability of the holding arising from the losses was not adequately demonstrated.</P>

      <P>In view of the delay in completing the final report of the South Galway flood study and the fact that there are no economically viable flood relief schemes being recommended for implementation arising from this major investigation, it has been agreed to extend the closing date for receipt of applications under the Government's Humanitarian Aid for the Victims of Flooding in 1995 &mdash; home relocation scheme from 1 June 1988 to 1 October 1998.  This time extension should provide ample opportunity for those who meet the qualifying criteria to submit their applications for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In relation to the farmyard relocation relief scheme I am advised by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, that in 1995 the Government allocated some £600,000 towards farmyard relocation in areas affected by severe flooding in early 1995.  The scheme was confined to farmers whose farm buildings and farmyards were subjected to substantial flooding for a minimum of 21 consecutive days in the period January-March 1995.  Only farmyards and buildings which were rendered totally inoperative due to high levels of flood water were considered; 135 applications were received but only 18 farmers qualified for aid under the scheme.  To date two farmers have been paid £57,954.</P>

      <P>The Memorandum of Understanding, to which the Deputy refers, relates to exchanges between the UK Civil Service and the Irish Civil Service. Under the terms of the memorandum, which was signed by representatives of Ireland and the UK on 19 October 1984, civil servants from Ireland may be seconded to the UK Civil Service for six months or more, with a reciprocal arrangement for civil servants from the UK to be seconded to the Irish Civil Service.  It was envisaged that there would be a maximum of about three exchanges each way at any one time.  Since the scheme began it has evolved over time as mutually agreed between the Irish Department of Finance, formerly by the Department of the Public Service, and the UK Cabinet Office.</P>
      <P>As discussed with the Cabinet Office, a limited number of Departments were targeted and approached in the initial years of the scheme.  In 1992, following further discussions with the Cabinet Office, it was decided to broaden the trawl to encompass all Departments and to trawl approximately every two years.</P>
      <P>Participation in the scheme, both on the part of Departments and of individuals in those Departments, is voluntary.  In general, staff who are nominated under the scheme have been offered placements.  On occasion, those offers have been declined due to changes in personal circumstances.</P>
      <P>The applications of ten Irish civil servants have recently been forwarded to the UK Cabinet Office, with a view to placement in 1998.  Discussions are taking place with the Cabinet Office as to ways in which the scheme could be given a fresh impetus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle income earned on community employment schemes is liable to income tax in the normal way.  Treating such <Col N="1281" /> income as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>The personal tax burden is of particular concern to the Government.  Consequently in the 1998 budget relief was focused towards lowering the tax burden.  This was achieved through significant improvements in the income tax and PRSI areas.  Measures announced in the budget include increasing the personal allowances by £250 for single persons to £3,150 and by £500 for married persons to £6,300 and widening the standard band by £100 single &mdash; £200 married.  In addition, the standard and top rates of income tax were reduced by 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>The general income exemption limits were increased by £100 single &mdash; £200 married to £4,100 single &mdash; £8,200 married.  Furthermore, the income exemption limits for the elderly were increased significantly from the new tax year by £400 single &mdash; £800 married for those aged 65 to 74 to £5,000 single &mdash; £10,000 married and by £300 single &mdash; £600 married for those aged 75 and over to £5,500 single &mdash; £11,000 married.  Further significant gains have accrued to those in employment, especially the low paid, from the increase in the PRSI-free allowance by £20 to £100 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.  These measures will not only improve take-home pay for those in employment but also contribute to the maintenance and creation of employment.</P>
      <P>The tax improvements introduced in the 1998 budget have, as in the case of other taxpayers, reduced the tax liability of people in community employment schemes who are liable to tax.  In the case of a person earning £85 per week, the combined income tax and PRSI liability in the last tax year was an average of £3.83 per week.  Following the changes in this year's budget the average weekly income tax liability for a single person on these earnings is £2.17, there is now no PRSI liability on weekly earnings below £100, a reduction in the combined income tax and PRSI liability of £1.66 per week.</P>

      <P>There are no Government charges levied in relation to opening a bank account.  However, there are a number of stamp duty charges on financial instruments.</P>
      <P>Section 17 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1981 imposes a stamp duty charge in respect of credit cards and charge cards.  Duty at £15 per annum is charged on these cards and the yield from this charge in 1997 was £9.1 milllion.</P>
      <P>Section 203 of the Finance Act, 1992, introduced a stamp duty charge on ATM cards.  Duty at £5 per annum, per ATM card is charged and the yield from this charge in 1997 was £7.5 million. ATM cards which have not been used during the taxable period or ATM cards issued in respect of a deposit account where the average daily balance did not exceed £10, do not attract the £5 annual charge.</P>
      <P>The charge to stamp duty on credit cards, charge cards and ATM cards is levied on financial institutions.  However, these institutions are entitled to, and usually do, pass on this stamp duty charge to their customers.</P>
      <P>The holders of chequing accounts pay a seven pence stamp duty charge in respect of every cheque drawn on an account within the State. These stamp duty charges were introduced to allow greater scope for reducing overall levels of direct taxation on employment and the revenue received makes an important contribution towards funding the Government's policies. Consequently, I do not have any plans at this stage to broaden the existing exemptions from these stamp duty charges.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has been charged to tax in accordance with returns of income which he submitted.  There is no provision in the Tax Acts which would enable the Commissioners to waive payment of tax returned as due or to reduce the amount payable. However, the inspector of taxes understands that the taxpayer purchased land in 1992 and financed the purchase by means of a bank loan. The interest on such a loan would be allowable as a tax deduction.  No loan interest figures have been included in the farm accounts for either of the two tax years for which there is an outstanding tax liability.  The taxpayer is, therefore, advised to contact his inspector of taxes with details of interest paid on the loan.  On receipt of this information and supporting documentation the inspector will amend the assessments as appropriate.</P>

      <Quest>if, under capital gains tax legislation, a farmer over 55 years who has owned the property for ten years or more is exempt from capital against tax if he disposes of a portion of his farm for development purposes and the remainder for agricultural use where the combined price is less than £250,000; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Capital gains tax retirement relief is a relief given to an individual on the disposal of all or part of the qualifying business assets, provided that the individual is aged 55 years or more at the date of disposal and the other conditions are satisfied. Where all the conditions are met, the relief takes the form of a relief on the tax, CGT, payable on gains accruing on the disposal of the qualifying assets.  If the disposal is made to a child of the individual owner, then there is no limit on the proceeds of the disposal, or gain, which may qualify for full relief.  Where the disposal is made to a person other than a child of the individual owner, then full relief is available where the aggregate sale proceeds of the disposal does not exceed £250,000.  For the purpose of the relief, qualifying assets include chargeable business assets, which are assets used for the purpose of farming as well as other business activities.</P>
      <P>Given that all the relevant conditions are met, the individual would be able to avail of the retirement relief provisions contained in the capital gains tax code for the disposal of his farm, regardless of the subsequent use made of the land.</P>

      <P>The Mulkear River (Cappamore) certified drainage scheme is now at works stage. However, the discovery of a significant archaeological feature in Gortnascarry townland during a routine archaeological test excavation along the proposed route of the bypass channel for Cappamore has meant that alternative routes for the bypass channel are currently under consideration. While the discovery has delayed the planned start of works on the Cappamore scheme by a matter of weeks, it is expected that works will recommence within the next two months.  It is not envisaged that the initial delay will impact significantly on the scheme completion date at the end of the year 2000.</P>

The estimated costs for engineering solutions in the report are orders of cost, prepared by the Irish firm of engineering consultants to the team, for those civil engineering works identified by the consultants and described in the text and drawings in the final report as means of alleviating flooding in the South Galway area.  Without the benefit of further more detailed examination and preparation of separate designs for each solution proposed, it is not possible to give more definitive costings for these works.

      <P>Section 6 (2) requires the provision of reasonable assistance to persons with a disability to facilitate the exercise of their rights under the Act and section 28 addresses the question of records of a medical, psychiatric or social work nature. On the application of these sections, officials in my Department are engaged in discussions at an interdepartmental working group chaired by the Department of Finance.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to supports available for people with disabilities introduced and operated by my Department.</P>
      <P>Infectious Diseases Maintenance Allowance (IDMA): this allowance is payable to people who are unable to make reasonable provision for their own maintenance or that of their dependants because they are undergoing treatment for an infectious disease specified in the regulations.  It was introduced under the 1947 Health Act and Regulations, these are updated annually.  The current personal rate is £70.50 per week.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary Care Allowance (DCA): the DCA applies to severely disabled children between the ages of two and 16 who are living at home and who need a level of care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age.  It was introduced by a departmental circular in 1973 under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970.  The current rate is £106.70 per month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Blind Welfare Allowance (BWA): this is a supplementary allowance for unemployed blind-visually <Col N="1292" /> impaired people who are also recipients of blind pension, disability allowance or an old age pension.  The BWA was introduced under the Blind Persons Act, 1920, and criteria for eligibility were set out in a departmental circular in March 1979.  The maximum personal rate is now £21.90 per week.</P>
    <P>Mobility Allowance: this is a monthly payment to severely disabled people who satisfy a means test and who are unable to walk or use public transport.  Its purpose is to finance occasional taxi journeys for people in this category.  The allowance came into effect following a departmental circular in August 1979 and the statutory basis is section 61 of the Health Act, 1970.  The maximum rate is £41.40 per month.</P>
    <P>Motorised Transport Grant: this grant is payable, subject to a means test to people with disabilities who need a car in order to gain or retain employment.  However, people living in an isolated area may also qualify under this scheme. The motorised transport grant came into operation in 1968 and guidelines are contained in departmental circulars issued in 1968 and 1974. The maximum grant payable is £2,884.</P>
    <P>Rehabilitation Allowance (Top Up): this allowance is payable to people with disabilities who are over 16 years of age, engaged in full-time rehabilitation training approved by the relevant health board and living away from home.  Criteria for eligibility on means and medical grounds are similar to those which apply to disability allowance. The disabled person's rehabilitation allowance was originally established under regulations in 1963 which were amended in 1973.  The rate of payment is £15 per week.</P>
    <P>Capitation Allowances for Disabled Persons in Training Centres and Community Workshops: these allowances are intended to meet the cost of providing vocational training and make a small payment to the trainee.  The statutory basis is section 68 of the Health Act, 1970, and the current rates are £1,284 per annum for rehabilitation training centres and £1,167 per annum for community workshops.</P>

      <P>Official data on the nationality of mothers presenting in maternity hospitals is not routinely collected by the hospitals concerned.  However, I have been made aware by the hospitals that an increasing number of non-nationals are presenting at the three Dublin maternity hospitals for service.  For example, at the Coombe Hospital, a total of 51 non-EU nationals were booked for ante-natal care in 1997 with a further 17 booked for the first quarter of 1998.  This figure is in respect of those who have booked for ante-natal care and does not include patients who present but have not booked.  The other Dublin maternity hospitals have also indicated that significant numbers of non-nationals are presenting for service.</P>
      <P>My Department is working with the maternity hospitals to quantify the volume of activity and costs associated with this group.  I will include this matter in forthcoming discussions on the financial estimates for the health services for 1999 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of <Col N="1295" /> children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are different timescales for the completion of the assessment process in the different health boards.  This difference arises principally from the greater volume of applications in some areas, particularly in the Eastern Health Board.  I met senior management of the Eastern Health Board last year to discuss delays in carrying out assessments of couples who wished to adopt children from abroad and had a further meeting with the board last month at which the issue was also discussed.</P>
      <P>As I have previously informed the House, arising from the additional funding approved to the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998, the board has proposed, in its 1998 Service Plan, the appointment of three new social workers to its adoption service; 2.5 of these posts have so far been filled.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of couples who wish to adopt children abroad.</P>
      <P>I understand that the current time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board is 12 months: a reduction of two months on 1997.  This reduction can be accounted for by the allocation of additional resources and to greater efficiencies in the overall process of application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical <Col N="1296" /> cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines have been drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, he/she may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</P>
      <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, as a general rule, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependents wihtout hardship.</P>
      <P>Under the long-term illness scheme operated by health boards, children and adults suffering from a number of conditions including mental handicap can obtain, without charge, the prescribed drugs and medicines necessary for the treatment of that condition.  In addition, children receiving treatment for mental handicap are exempt from public hospital statutory charges.</P>

      <P>In March 1997 the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy.  Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme for women aged 50-64. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and the importance of ensuring that the Irish programme meets the necessary <Col N="1297" /> quality assurance criteria.  As Minister for Health and Children, I am very much aware of the unnecessary trauma and anguish that could be caused to women and their families as a result of mistakes in an organised screening programme. It is for this reason that the Irish national breast screening programme must be driven by international quality assurance standards and best practice.</P>
    <P>Specifically the phasing will take account of the following critical success factors: the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population, ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the lead-in time involved in the development of IT systems, the establishment of a population register and the recruitment of consultant and support staff, I am advised that we should be in a position to start the programme by autumn 1998.  I am committed to making the necessary resources available to the programme to facilitate the commencement of screening and substantial funding has already been made available in 1998 to meet the start up costs for the programme.</P>
    <P>Decisions taken in relation to subsequent phases, including the Western Health Board area, will be guided by the experience gained from putting phase I of the programme in place.  The steering committee has recommended that phase II of the programme should follow phase I as soon as is practicable.</P>

      <P>In the case of such persons, the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, provides statutory entitlement to a range of primary health care services. The services in place include general practitioner services, home nursing, dental and ophthalmic services, home help and counselling support as well as drugs and medicines.  Each health board has appointed a liaison officer to ensure the smooth operation of the delivery of services under the Act, and to act as a contact point for individuals and for the various interest groups whose members avail of services under the Act.  My Department maintains contact with the representative organisations and the health board liaison officers to ensure that any issues which arise in relation to services provision can be tackled quickly and effectively.</P>
      <P>In relation to secondary care services, treatment for those who contracted hepatitis C from the receipt of blood or blood products is being provided at special consultant staffed clinics at six designated hospitals: Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital in Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>These services, provided under the Health Act, 1970, are free of charge and include access to both in-patient and out-patient treatment, as required.  Special funding has been, and will continue to be, provided by my Department for these services to ensure that the needs of hepatitis C patients are met.</P>

Persons in category 2, non-medical card holders, have limited eligibility for health services, including an entitlement to public hospital and public consultant treatment subject only to modest statutory charges and out-patient services free of charge.</P>
    <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a person is liable for a statutory charge, unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  This charge is currently set at £25 per night, subject to a maximum of £250 in any 12 month period.  Persons who attend the accident and emergency department directly without having a referral note from their GP are liable for a charge of £20 which applies only to the first visit of any episode of care.</P>
    <P>Public hospital statutory charges are based on the principle that those who can afford to do so are required to make a contribution towards the cost of providing hospital services.  There are a number of exemptions to the charges, including medical card holders, women receiving maternity services, children up to six weeks of age, children receiving treatment for mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia or cerebral palsy, children referred from child health clinics and school health examinations and persons receiving services in respect of prescribed infectious diseases.  Furthermore, the charge may be waived in respect of an individual if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</P>

      <P>Figures collected by my Department relate to the number of people on the in-patient waiting lists of a particular hospital rather than to a patient's place of residence.  It would not, therefore, be possible to give details of the number of people waiting on a county by county basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of people on the waiting list for hip and other replacement treatments at 31 December 1997 at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, were: total hip replacements, 185; total knee <Col N="1300" /> replacements, 27; other elective orthopaedic procedures, 375; the total was 587.</P>
    <P>Since the waiting list initiative commenced in 1993, it has focused upon those areas of hospital treatment where long waiting times have caused the greatest difficulty, including orthopaedics.</P>
    <P>I have provided a total of £12 million to address hospital waiting lists in 1998.  This brings to £70 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initiative commenced in 1993.  It represents a 50 per cent increase over the funding made available last year for waiting list work.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have recently established a review group to advise on how best to maximise the effectiveness of the current waiting list initiative. The group has been asked to conclude its work by the end of June.</P>

      <P>Consumption of tobacco increases the risk of morbidity from a wide range of illnesses.  These include cancers, diseases of the heart and circulatory system, and respiratory conditions.  Data on hospital discharges are collected through the hospital in-patient inquiry, HIPE system which covers all publicly funded acute hospitals. Returns for 1997 are 80 per cent complete, and the following table sets out statistics showing the numbers of hospital discharges for conditions regarded as smoking related.  A total of 54,158 hospitalisations fall into this category, representing 14 per cent of all hospital discharges and accounting for an estimated 20 per cent of hospital inpatient costs.  Caution should be exercised <Col N="1301" /> in the interpretation of these figures since they include all hospitalisations from the specified illnesses, irrespective of whether or not they were due to smoking.</P>
      <P>International studies indicate that 19 per cent of all deaths in Ireland can be attributed to smoking. This figure derives from the publication Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries, 1950-2000 by Richard Peto and others, who used the results of epidemiological studies of mortality in smokers versus non-smokers in the United States to assign proportions of total mortality due to tobacco for each relevant cause of death.  Similar proportions are not available for morbidity and it is, therefore not possible to estimate with any precision the share of hospitalisations for smoking related illnesses which are due either directly or indirectly to smoking.  For the same reasons, it is not possible to state what proportion of hospital costs are due to the effects of smoking.</P>

    <P>My Department had recent detailed discussions with the Western Health Board on the operation of the regional orthodontic unit.  There has been a steady rise in the number undergoing treatment, rising from about 600 in 1994 to 3,300 by the end of 1997.  The quality of clinical care being provided is up to the highest international standards. It is expected that the waiting period for treatment, which is currently two years, will be reduced progressively over 1999.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 163 of 29 January 1998.</P>
      <P>The green route, which has been partly constructed, originates from a long-standing local authority proposal to cater for internal suburban traffic in the areas concerned.  As such it has not been designated, nor is it proposed for designation, as a national road.  Responsibility for the financing of the green route, accordingly, rests with the local authorities concerned on the basis of their own resources, including discretionary grants from my Department and the proceeds of relevant development levies.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is in principle limited to the development, including the financing, of the national road network.  The authority may occasionally, however, cater for limited works on non-national roads necessitated by specific national road improvements.  In this connection, I understand that Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is in consultation with the authority with a view to determining the extent, if any, to which a limited section of the green route in the vicinity of the proposed Ballinteer interchange might be financed from national road grants.</P>

    <P>The scheme is an effective response to the housing needs of certain approved applicants for local authority housing and a valuable element in the range of measures available to meet social housing need.  Since its introduction, the terms and conditions of the scheme have been modified a number of times to make it more attractive and to encourage its use by local authorities.  In November 1997, as part of a package of improvements to various social housing schemes, the threshold above which prior departmental approval for work under the scheme is required was increased to £20,000 generally and to £25,000 in the case of offshore islands.  To further boost the effectiveness of the scheme, I recently allocated an extra £1 million to authorities, bringing the total available to fund work under this scheme in 1998 to £3.6 million.</P>

      <P>The Road Traffic (Public Services <Col N="1305" /> Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, terminated the transferability of hackney licences, with the exception that a hackney licence may devolve on the personal representative upon the death of a holder.</P>
      <P>This provision was adopted against the background that hackney licences, unlike taxi licences, are not subject to numerical quotas; that hackney licences wherever issued may be used countrywide; and that it was desirable to avoid the creation of a private market in hackney licences, such as exists in some areas for taxi licences.</P>
      <P>In the light of experience to date of the 1995 regulations and of submissions from local authorities and other interested parties, I will be prepared to consider the case for any necessary regulatory improvements.</P>

      <P>Notification of a proposed framework for a new urban renewal scheme, which issued to each city and county manager on 14 May 1997, indicated that the selection and prioritisation of areas for integrated area plans and the preparation of plans for priority areas would be the responsibility of the relevant city corporation or county council.  It was not indicated that such selection and prioritisation of areas and preparation of plans was to be a reserved function and, accordingly, it was a matter for each authority involved to decide on their own arrangements in this regard.  However, guidelines issued by my Department provided, <i>inter alia</i>, that wide, cross-sectoral consultation and involvement should form an essential element in the preparation of each integrated area plan.</P>
      <P>The statutory basis for integrated area plans is contained in the Urban Renewal Bill, 1998, which was published on 28 May 1998.  The Bill, as published, does not make the function a reserved one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years, my Department has enacted the following measures relating to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Electoral Act, 1992; the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1996, and the Electoral Act, 1997, contain provisions designed to facilitate voting by people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979; the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993; and the Housing (New House Grants etc.) Regulations, 1990, as amended most recently by the Housing (New House Grants etc.) Regulations, 1990 (Amendment) Regulations, 1996, provide for the payment of grants in respect of accommodation for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>Under the Housing Act, 1988, local authorities are required, in making an assessment of housing needs, to have regard to the need for housing of certain categories of persons, including persons who are disabled or handicapped.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1995 (S.  I. No. 69 of 1995) amended Part 1 of the Second Schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, to provide that planning permission is not required for the conversion of a house to a residential care facility accommodating up to six people with disabilities. Furthermore, where it is necessary to seek planning permission, no fee is payable to the planning authority for facilities, mainly non-profitmaking, for the disabled.</P>
      <P>The Building Regulations, 1991, place a duty on persons providing or reconstructing buildings to cater for the needs of the disabled.  Technical Guidance Document M-Access for Disabled Persons &mdash; provides technical guidance on how these requirements can be complied with.  In December 1997, an updated building control package, comprising consolidated Building Regulations, 1997, and revised Technical Guidance Documents (1997 edition) was published.</P>
      <P>Section 57(2) of the Roads Act, 1993, requires that road authorities and the National Roads Authority give special consideration, when drawing up toll schemes, to exempting from toll charges vehicles specially adapted for use by physically handicapped persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1992, empowered local authorities to provide disabled persons parking bays.  The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, <Col N="1308" /> provide for disabled persons parking permits to be issued.  The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1992, and the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1995, 1997 and 1998, include provisions relating to wheelchair accessible taxis.</P>

      <Quest>if, in regard to the allocation of the rate support grant to local authorities in 1998, the equalisation provisions of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, were used to ensure a fair allocation between all authorities; if not, the criteria or mechanism used to determine the grant for each authority; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, did not include any equalisation provisions with regard to the allocation of rate support grant equalisation funding.</P>
      <P>The 1997 equalisation fund allocations replaced income lost from the rate support grant and domestic water and sewerage charges, together with revenue losses arising from a change in the treatment of the proceeds from the pre-1993 house sales scheme.  Initial 1997 allocations to local authorities consisted of a combination of rate support grant, retained motor tax income and payments from the equalisation fund.</P>
      <P>These allocations were calculated on the following basis:</P>
      <P Just="Center">BASIS FOR ALLOCATION</P>
      <P>1.  1996 base Rate Support Grant increased by 2 per cent.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Plus</P>
      <P>2.  (a) 1996 Domestic Water and Sewerage Charges Warrant (including arrears but excluding waivers) increased by 2 per cent.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Multiplied by</P>
      <P>(b) the greater of:</P>
      <P>(i) 1996 percentage collection rate of domestic Water and Sewerage Charges Warrant</P>

      <P>(ii) Average percentage Collection Rate 1993-96 inclusive</P>
      <P Just="Center">Increased by</P>
      <P>(c) Percentage increase in combined rate of domestic water and sewerage charge for 1997 over 1996.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Plus</P>
      <P>3.  Revenue forgone as a result of changes in treatment of pre-1993 House Sales Schemes proceeds in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> Given that the main purpose in 1997 in allocating funds was to replace income lost, this has been achieved as fairly as possible through using this formula.</P>
    <P>As a result of motor tax buoyancy during 1997, an additional £8 million became available for allocation to local authorities.  These additional allocations which related to 1997 were notified to authorities in March this year.  After allocating an extra 1.75 per cent of initial allocations across the board to all local authorities, a model using the following five criteria was used for allocation of the balance: (1) penny produce; (2) net effective valuation, NEV, <i>per capita</i>; (3) non-State assisted expenditure related to NEV; (4) water and sewerage expenditure related to NEV; and, (5) size of road network related to NEV.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been notified that 1998 allocations are 2 per cent above the revised 1997 allocations.</P>
    <P>My Department is sponsoring a Needs and Resources pilot study which is currently being conducted by Galway County Council.  It is my intention that this will facilitate the development of an equalisation model that can be applied nationally.  The needs and resources of the various local authorities need to be measured so that funding can be distributed in a fair manner.  The model will need to be flexible enough to take account of factors that may apply to any authority.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998, is to put in place a legal framework within which accommodation for travellers can be provided within a reasonable <Col N="1312" /> period of time.  Section 7 provides that the adoption, amendment or replacement of a traveller accommodation programme is a reserved function, that is, it is to be adopted by resolution of the members of the authority.  It is only in the event that the members of an authority fail to perform their duty by the date specified by the Minister that the manager is required to adopt the programme by order within one month of that date.  The manager may make such amendments to the draft programme as are, in the opinion of the manager, considered appropriate which allows the manager to take account of views expressed by members of the authority in the course of the debate on the adoption of the programme. I consider that this measure is not out of line with the principle of subsidiarity and is justified to ensure that necessary progress is made by local authorities with the provision of accommodation for travellers.</P>

      <P>A ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal has operated in Dublin since 1990 and in Cork since 1995.  In fulfilment of the Government commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, I recently announced the extension of the ban to Arklow, Drogheda, Dundalk, Limerick and Wexford to take effect from 1 October, 1998.  In selecting these additional areas, I assessed air quality data in all monitored areas, including Waterford City. Although preventive measures are not proposed outside the selected areas at present, the data and the need for further action will be kept under ongoing review.</P>
      <P>International experience and independent Irish research have shown that excessive levels of smoke pollution are associated with increased hospital admissions, increased morbidity and a peak in mortality.  Excessive smoke pollution has both acute and chronic health effects, in particular for high-risk groups, such as the elderly and people with asthma or diseases of the lungs.</P>

      <P>Under the regulations governing the disabled persons grant scheme, my Department recoups to housing authorities 50 per cent of the cost of each disabled persons grant paid by them, subject to a maximum of £4,000.  The regulations do not specify a maximum limit on the amount of grant a local authority may pay.  However, as housing authorities generally limit the grant they pay to twice the maximum recoupment available from my Department, the effective ceiling generally for the grant is £8,000.  The scheme does not provide for the making of contributions by my Department to households to supplement disabled persons grants paid by local authorities nor <Col N="1314" /> are there funds available to me from which I could make a contribution.</P>
      <P>I am, in the context of the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, examining possible options to extend the range of measures currently available to assist low income households in securing necessary improvement works to their housing, including the disabled persons grants scheme.

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community by providing once-off funding for certain types of security equipment. Under the scheme grants are made available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tire, Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, which have undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the assistance provided under the scheme.  Under the scheme once-off grants can be made towards the cost of: smallscale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security equipment; and socially-monitored alarm systems. Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder/burglar alarms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  However the actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which <Col N="1315" /> must be met.  In general, grants cover 50 per cent of the total costs involved.</P>
    <P>As the closing date for receipt of applications under the 1998 scheme was only 22 May last, all of the applications received in the Regional Offices of my Department are still being processed. It is not, therefore, possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy at this stage. My Department will contact all organisations which have submitted applications under the scheme as soon as a decision has been made.  It is anticipated that the first grants will be paid under the scheme from late autumn onwards.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of people in receipt of old age pensions and expenditure on these pensions is contained in the following Table 1.</P>
      <P>This Government, in its action programme, is committed to increasing the maximum personal rate of old age contributory and retirement pensions to £100 per week over a five year period. Significant progress towards achieving this aim was made in the 1998 budget which provided for a special increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments for pensioners aged 66 and over.  Payment of these increases comes into effect this week.  These increases, which are significantly ahead of inflation, will apply not only to people receiving old age (contributory and non-contributory) and retirement pensions but also to people over 66 in receipt of widow's and widower's pensions, blind pensions, carer's allowances and people over 65 in receipt of invalidity pensions.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of further increasing the maximum rate of old age (contributory) pension and retirement pension to £100 per week along with appropriate increases in other pension rates is shown in Table 2.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the number of measures which his Department has enacted referring to people with disabilities; the date of their passing; the benefits accruing to them; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  In this context, the Government is ensuring that disability is placed on the agenda of every Department and public body.  The budget allocation for my Department, for example, provides for the introduction of a range of measures, costing some £10 million in 1998 and £17.5 million in a full year, for people with disabilities and carers which will further enhance their position and will make significant progress in implementing the commitments in the Action Programme for the Millennium in this area.</P>
      <P>From this week, people with disabilities aged 66 and over will receive an increase of £5 a week in their personal payments, while those aged under 66 will receive an increase of £3.  These increases represent real increases of between 2.3 per cent and 5.3 per cent.  As a result of these increases, payments to some 91,000 people with disabilities will be brought above the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, ranging between 101 per cent and 118 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has recommended that incentives to take up employment and educational opportunities should be available to people on disability payments.  My Department has made progress in this regard in recent years.  For example, the back-to-work allowance scheme, under which unemployed people can take up employment and continue to retain a portion of their social welfare payment and the related secondary benefits was extended to people with disabilities in 1997.  This measure complements the existing employment supports which are available through the NRB and which are of particular importance to people with disabilities in gaining access in the open labour market.</P>
      <P>However, it is accepted that many people with disabilities are not in a position to engage in such employment.  Accordingly, additional measures are required to facilitate these people so that they can engage in other forms of employment and training, such as sheltered or rehabilitative employment.  This year's budget provides for a significant increase, from £36.30 to £50 per week, in the amount of earnings from rehabilitative employment which can be disregarded for means test purposes in the case of the disability allowance and blind person's pension schemes.  This measure is coming into force from this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to education allowance (formerly second and third level allowance) is also being extended to people in receipt of disability allowance and blind person's pension from September, 1998.  Under the back to education allowance, a participant who is receiving a reduced rate of payment <Col N="1319" /> will have their payment topped up to the maximum rate.  In addition, participants receive a cost of education allowance of £150 towards the cost of books and related expenses.</P>
    <P>Arising from savings in my Department's Vote, the Government was able to provide a substantial investment of cash to assist people with disabilities towards the end of last year.  A total of £4.825 million extra was made available to assist community and voluntary organisations working with people with disabilities and older people to cover a range of equipment necessary to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities, including accessible buses, motorised wheelchairs, training equipment, information systems, deafness aids, computers and special beds and hoists.  A further £50,000 was made available to the Irish Council for People with Disabilities for computer equipment for their 30 county networks.</P>
    <P>A range of other measures provided for in this year's budget and which will improve the position of people with disabilities are described briefly as follows.  From April 1998, people transferring from invalidity pension, disability allowance and blind person's pension to another social welfare pension, e.g. widow/er's (contributory) pension can retain entitlement to the &ldquo;free&rdquo; schemes; the companion travel pass is being extended to all pensioners aged 75 and over who are unfit to travel alone from September 1998; free travel is being extended to all recipients of carer's allowance from September 1998; from April 1998, foreign disability pensions, up to the level of the old age (contributory) pension, are disregarded for means test purposes under the carer's allowance scheme; from April 1998, the full-time care and attention condition for carer's allowance purposes has been relaxed to allow the carer to attend education or training courses or participate in voluntary or community activities for around ten hours a week; and from April 1998, the carer's allowance continues to be paid from 6 weeks after the death of a spouse being cared for, where that spouse was not getting a social welfare payment.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists certain householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks yearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week is payable during the heating season to fuel recipients in Dublin and Cork to help meet <Col N="1320" /> the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal.  This allowance will be extended to Limerick, Wexford, Arklow, Dundalk and Drogheda from October 1998.  In recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, the scheme is not confined to the winter months but runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April.  Any extension of the duration of the scheme would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  It is estimated that to extend the scheme from six to 12 months would cost an additional £45 million.  The estimated cost of extending the fuel season to 52 weeks for the elderly is an extra £15.3 million each year.</P>
    <P>There is a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  This operates in addition to the national fuel scheme.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a person who has exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating supplement. This can be paid as a weekly supplement in addition to other social welfare payments.  An application for a heating supplement may be made by contacting the community welfare officer at the local health centre.</P>
    <P>Where a person would not normally qualify for a heating supplement there is provision under the SWA scheme to pay an exceptional needs payment. The purpose of ENPs is to help prevent hardship by providing for essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which applicants could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  ENPs are payable at the discretion of the health board taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case.  These facilities under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are already in place and are considered by me to be a more appropriate mechanism to meet the needs of those who are experiencing financial difficulties due to exceptional heating needs.</P>

      <P>The free TV licence scheme is available to people aged 66 or over who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy this condition.  Certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments also qualify.  In addition, widows-widowers between the ages of 60 and 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free TV licence scheme retain that entitlement.  More than 200,000 people qualified for free television licences in 1997 at an annual cost of over £14 million.</P>
      <P>The range of the free schemes currently available does not include assistance towards the cost of cable television or other forms of deflected television systems.

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides entitlement to any persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department.  SWA provides the lowest rates of weekly payment within the social welfare system. Payment may continue as long as the asylum seeker is resident in the State.</P>
      <P>SWA payments are currently being made to some 3,000 households in respect of 3,800 adults and some 1,200 children.  About three quarters of asylum seekers are single people, mostly males, without dependants and are paid £68.40 per week.  In addition, if they are living in rented accommodation, they may qualify for a rent supplement. There are 316 families in receipt of child benefit in respect of 533 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total expenditure by my Department on asylum seekers in 1998 will depend on a number of factors, including the numbers arriving during the <Col N="1322" /> year and the length of time it takes to finalise asylum applications.  The current provision in the Estimates for expenditure by my Department on asylum seekers, including payments in respect of children, is £32 million in 1998.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed, however, that this estimate depends on a wide range of factors, including for example, the rate of arrival of asylum seekers and the length of stay in temporary accommodation.  The Deputy will therefore appreciate that it is not possible to provide a very precise estimate.</P>

      <P>Dúchas, my Department's Heritage Service, is aware that areas of dune in the Banna region which are within a proposed Natural Heritage Area (NHA) have recently been worked on.  The work in question <Col N="1323" /> appears to be subject to planning permission and it is therefore a matter in the first instance for Kerry County Council.  The council has contacted my Department for advice on how the ecology of the site can best be restored and the relevant officials of Dúchas have made themselves available to the council in this context.</P>

      <P>Generally speaking, the offices, visitor centres, cultural institutions and other public buildings under the direct control of my Department are accessible to people with disabilities. In a number of cases where this is not possible, investigations are ongoing with a view to taking steps to improve the situation.  My Department is also committed to ensuring that the design of any new offices and visitor centres will mean that such facilities will be fully accessible.</P>
      <P>Not all national monuments in State care are accessible to people with disabilities and those that are accessible to persons with one category of disability would not necessary be accessible to those with a different disability.  Where specialist visitor facilities are provided, every effort is made to provide access for such people consistent with the overriding need not to interfere with the integrity of the monument.  Where there are restrictions, these are generally adverted to in the free booklet, entitled Heritage Sites &mdash; Opening Hours and Admission Charges which is published each year for the information of intending visitors by the Education and Visitor Service of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been undertaken by my Department to improve the service to those with disabilities.  For instance, training in disability awareness is ongoing throughout the Department.  National Museum attendants in Collins Barracks receive extensive training in dealing with people with disabilities in association with the National Rehabilitation Board.  The National Museum's exhibitions at Collins Barracks feature several reproduction artefacts which are tactile and directional information outside lifts is in braille.  In the National Gallery all staff are trained in disability awareness and a member of its Education Department is in charge of Disability Services and is available to provide assistance and answer queries.  Also in the National Gallery an induction-loop has been installed in the lecture threatre gallery for people with impaired hearing.  A bi-lingual access guide to the services and facilities in the National Gallery <Col N="1324" /> is also available in braille.  It lists general services available to people with disabilities and also lists services for specific disabilities.  Public tours of the gallery for people with impaired sight using Tactile Picture Sets and for people with impaired hearing using an interpreter take place monthly.</P>
    <P>One of the conditions which my Department has attached to the 39 projects which have been approved for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-9 is that the end product be fully accessible to people with disabilities. This means that a whole range of arts and culture facilities being developed or refurbished under the scheme will be fully accessible to people with disabilities.</P>

      <Quest>if she will provide additional compensation for a small number of farmers surrounding Ballinturley lake, Athleague, County Roscommon in view of the fact that these farmers have over 70 per cent of their farms designated as an SAC thereby making farms uneconomical; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I do not accept that the inclusion of a large proportion of a farm in a proposed SAC can make previously viable farms unviable.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has now agreed that under the REP scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, payments of £80 an acre up to 100 acres, £8 an acre from 101-200 acres and £6 an acre from 201-300 acres will be available in respect of land proposed for inclusion within natural heritage areas NHAs. SAC lands are included within the proposed NHA network.  Those who are already in REPS can avail of these higher payment levels, the previous rate for proposed NHA land was £62 an acre, and in general they will have to make little change to their farming methods, provided they are already complying with their REPS plans. Those who decide, for whatever reason, that REPS does not meet their needs can have an agri-environmental plan arranged for their farm by my Department, which will specify any conditions that must be observed to protect the ecology of the designated areas.  The farmers can then quantify any losses arising for him as a result of compliance, and can make a claim to my Department for this amount.  Where agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available.  There is, therefore, no reason why farmers in proposed SAC areas should have any fears for the viability of their farms as a result of their inclusion.</P>

      <P>Planning permission was refused by An Bord Pleanála on appeal by third parties for a major extension to the National Gallery.  Following the decision by An Bord Pleanála a revised scheme for the Gallery extension has been prepared and submitted to Dublin Corporation for planning permission.</P>
      <P>On the assumption that planning permission will be forthcoming in accordance with the Planning Acts, it is envisaged that all contracts and commitments to suppliers and contractors on the project will have been entered into during 1999 and that the drawdown of European Regional Development Fund funds will be within the timeframe of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9.</P>
      <P>Construction of the extension in accordance with the revised scheme that has been submitted for planning permission will represent a major landmark development for the gallery and for the city of Dublin.  It is also a significant and high profile infrastructural addition to one of our most important national cultural institutions and will provide a new and invigorating attraction for visitors, both domestic and international.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Heritage Gaeltacht and the Islands, 30 film projects have received certification under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, and a further seven applications are being processed by my Department giving a total of 37 applications.</P>
      <P>A film policy area in my Department is staffed by one principal officer who also has other responsibilities, one assistant principal officer, one higher executive officer and one executive officer.</P>

    <P>The deadline for transposition of the Directive <Col N="1329" /> into national law is 3 June 1998, but there is provision for a maximum additional period of one year in case of &ldquo;special difficulties&rdquo;.  On 13 February 1998 my Department contacted the EU Commission seeking an additional six months in which to transpose the directive.  This approach was made by my Department because of its assessment of the likely time frame for finalisation of the legislation.  The Commission acceded to this request on 31 March, confirming that such a deferment would be in full compliance with the directive.  The social partners were informed of this request at a meeting on 21 May within the framework of Partnership 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following publication of the report A Strategy for Equality, an interdepartmental task force was established to draft a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities, based on the report.  I expect to receive the plan of action shortly and to submit it to Government for consideration as soon as possible thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to the work of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities and recognises the need for a permanent independent voice which would highlight issues of concern to people with disabilities.  I provided £700,000 in the Estimates to fund the work of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities in 1998. This more than doubled the 1997 Estimates provision of £300,000.  It will enable the interim council to expedite the work involved in establishing <Col N="1330" /> an agreed permanent council with a constitution, structure and membership that empowers and gives cohesion to its county networks, which are at the heart of this process.  It is expected that the permanent council will be established in 1999.</P>
    <P>In order to address the problem of access on information for people with disabilities, my Department has established a number of pilot community development projects in Ennis, Cork city, Tallaght-Clondalkin and south Kerry.  The projects commenced in the latter part of 1997 and it is intended, by means of these projects, to facilitate access at local level by people with disabilities to information, in appropriate formats, on the issues affecting their lives.  It is also intended to facilitate participation by people with disabilities in local area partnerships.  I have provided £160,000 in the Estimates for 1998 to ensure there is no reduction in momentum in the operation of the projects.</P>
    <P>On 25 July 1997 the monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities held its first meeting.  The committee is comprised of the representatives of people with disabilities, their parents and carers, as well as of the social partners, disability organisations and Government Departments.  It has been a valuable source of advice and assistance to the task force in the latter's work.</P>
    <P>I have also been committed to cross-departmental working so as to facilitate the effective delivery of services, to minimise bureaucracy and to promote equality for people with disabilities. As a result of such working, my colleague the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, in conjunction with Deputy Wallace, Minister of State at my Department with special responsibility for disability, announced a package of funding in October 1997 of £4,325,000 aimed at directly benefiting 11,000 people with disabilities and voluntary agencies. The funding was aimed at enhancing the opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve independent living and community integration.</P>
    <P>On 18 November 1997, I announced my intention to establish a national disability authority which would be an executive body with responsibility for monitoring and reporting on the impact of public policy and services on people with disabilities. An establishment group was set up to work on detailed proposals for establishing the NDA for submission to Government within six months.  The group, which held its first meeting on 18 December 1997, has also been examining the question of a disability support service and the transfer of certain departmental responsibilities for the training and employment of people with disabilities from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The group is expected to have it proposals ready for submission to Government this month.  Preliminary work on the preparation of legislative provisions, which will be required for the estabishing of the authority <Col N="1331" /> and the disability support service, is under way in my Department.</P>
    <P>Other legislation which impacts on disability and which is being progressed by my Deparmtent includes the Employment Equality Bill and an Equal Status Bill.  Both of these Bills passed through all stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1997 but, in a reference to the Supreme Court by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution, were found to be unconstitutional on a number of grounds.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Bill which outlaws discrimination in employment on grounds of disability, among others, is under consideration by the Oireachtas.  Regard was had in its drafting to the constitutional issues raised by the Supreme Court.  It completed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 28 May 1998 and it is hoped that the Bill will have completed all stages in the Dáil and Seanad and ready to be signed into law by the end of June 1998.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this legislation will give people with disabilities the protection of the law for the first time in relation to access to employment and advancement within employment.  It is hoped it will also contribute to a reduction in the unacceptable high rates of unemployment of people with disabilities generally and build an awareness of the prevalence of discrimination on grounds of disability in the workplace.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to bring an Equal Status Bill before the Oireachtas in the latter part of 1998. This Bill will outlaw discrimination on similar grounds as with the Employment Equality Bill, but outside of the workplace.  It, also, will have regard to the constitutional issues raised by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Children Act, 1997, was enacted on 9 December 1997.  Part III of the Act updates the law on the giving of evidence in certain civil proceedings by a person who has a mental disability. Part III takes into account recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. This Part of the Act will be the subject of a commencement order as soon as the necessary arrangements are put in place.</P>
    <P>When the planned legislative, institutional and services provision improvements for people with disabilities are in place it will be possible to consider the form which a Disability Bill might take and whether it will be necessary to bring forward proposals for a disability equality amendment to the Constitution in preparation for a Disability Bill.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of every Government Department and public body.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that any comments made by me at any time could be seen to inflame racism in Ireland.  However, the increased number of asylum seekers arriving here has, unfortunately, given rise to expressions of racism that were not articulated in Irish society up to now.  This has to be a matter of considerable concern and regret to all responsible people.  Last December, as the Deputy is aware, this House unanimously passed a motion which, among other things, condemned sentiments and manifestations of racism as inimical to respect for the dignity of all human beings and deplored hostile statements or acts directed against those from other countries seeking refuge in the State.  I reiterate that condemnation and I know Deputies join me in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the challenge facing European states in general &mdash; and facing Ireland at the moment &mdash; is to create structures which will enable those individuals who are refugees to be quickly identified and supported while at the same time, to preserve the integrity of the refugee concept and public confidence in the system generally, equally <Col N="1333" /> to quickly identify those who are not refugees and where necessary arrange for their repatriation.  In that regard, one has to bear in mind the clear and repeated view of the UNHCR that in order to maintain the integrity of the asylum process, those who do not qualify to remain in a country should not be allowed to remain.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for refugee status outstanding on 29 May 1998 was 5,759.</P>
      <P>As regards the countries of origin of the persons concerned, it has been the general policy of successive Ministers not to disclose information on the nationality of asylum seekers or refugees. This is due to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided.  Such identification could have serious implications particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin. However, where there is a significant number of applications from certain countries of origin I am prepared to list those nationalities.  The main countries of origin of asylum seekers this past year are Algeria, Nigeria, Romania, Somalia and Zaire.  I can also confirm that a small number of asylum seekers are from Bosnia.  Persons recognised as refugees would normally travel on documents issued by the state which recognised them as refugees under the terms of the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol and would be subject to immigration controls in the normal way.  No separate records are kept of illegal entry by persons recognised as refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who are seeking refugee status are not prosecuted for illegal entry.  A person detected attempting to enter illegally is normally refused <Col N="1336" /> leave to land and returned to his or her point of departure or country of origin as soon as travel arrangements can be made, unless that person seeks asylum.  Persons who seek asylum are admitted to the Irish asylum process, during which time it is not the practice for them to be detained.  Other persons refused leave to land may be detained pending the making of travel arrangements in a place specified in the fourth schedule to the Aliens Order, 1946, as inserted by Article 5 of the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of refugee admissions, member states generally respond on an individual basis to international appeals by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  In this way, Ireland has at different times admitted groups of refugees from, for example, Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia.  Provision has also been made in respect of both groups for the admission of family members and, in the case of Bosnia, of a number of medical evacuees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> Prompted by the refugee situation as a result of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the EU Council in September 1995 adopted a resolution on burden-sharing, more generally, with regard to the admission and residence of displaced persons on a temporary basis.  The resolution recognises that a given situation may require harmonised action to help persons displaced by conflict where there is, or is likely to be, a large influx into the territories of EU member states.  Any such action would be considered in consultation with the UNHCR, and would have regard to contributions already being made by individual member states in response to a particular situation.</P>
    <P>The only EU policy as regards the intake of asylum seekers into member states is the Dublin Convention which guarantees asylum seekers who arrive in the territory or at the borders of a member state of the European Communities that their application will be examined fully by one country in accordance with that country's determination procedure.  Section 22 of the Refugee Act, 1996 provides for the implementation of the Dublin Convention and the Dublin Convention Implementation Order, 1997 sets out the procedure for the processing of applications which fall within the ambit of the convention.</P>

      <P>In line with the commitment given in its joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, the Government decided in December 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.  The tender procedure is being conducted in line with procedures set out in EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC.  The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday, 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day.  The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>Developers were requested to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable primarily of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high performance swimmers for international competition.  They were also required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge and experience to undertake the project. The final date for receipt of candidatures was 5 March 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Invitation to Tender, ITT, documentation, including a comprehensive project brief, issued to nine qualified candidates on 26 March, inviting them to prepare full tender submissions for the project.  The Department has advised candidates that the draft contract-legal agreement for the project is currently being finalised and will not be available for a number of weeks yet.  It is not <Col N="1339" /> possible at this stage, therefore, to say precisely when a final decision will be made.  It is anticipated that the construction phase of the project will be 15 months from the date of any agreement, although a longer period will be considered in the light of submitted proposals.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt be aware that I recently participated in the launch by the Irish Youth Foundation of its initiative Companies Caring for Children.  This initiative, is designed to tackle problems faced by young people in areas of disadvantage where the Government's Young People's Facilities and Service Fund will also operate.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the £30 million Young People's Facilities and Services Fund is designed to provide facilities and services for young people in areas where a serious drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Twenty million pounds of the fund is being targeted at the 13 local drug task force areas.  Under the fund, development groups are being established in the target areas to prepare integrated plans to address the needs of young people in those areas. The youth foundation will work with these development groups, in selected areas, and with the assessment committee for the fund, to help the foundation identify how their contribution can have maximum impact and complement the Youth People's Facilities and Services Fund in the areas.</P>
      <P>Companies Caring for Children will focus initially on the four areas being targeted under the integrated services pilot project, Dublin North East Inner City, the canal communities, Jobstown in Tallaght and Togher in Cork.</P>
      <P>To launch the Companies Caring for Children project, the Chairman of the Irish Youth Foundation, Mr. Bill Cullen, has committed £250,000 over the next five years on behalf of his company, Renault Ireland.  He and Deputy Chairman, Tony O'Reilly Jr. have set a target of raising £1 million a year through the initiative.</P>
      <P>I warmly welcome this initiative and I look forward to further significant contributions from the corporate sector to help communities address the needs of young people at risk of drug abuse.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants at a standard rate of £50 per pupil towards the day to day running costs of primary schools. School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.</P>
      <P>The State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some schools have experienced difficulty in raising the local contribution.  In this context I should point out that since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged.  I should also point out that this year I have increased the standard rate of capitation grant from £45 to £50 per pupil, which represents an increase of 11 per cent over the 1997 rate.  In line with the commitment given in An Action Programme for the Millenium, I will continue to give a clear priority to primary education and will be seeking further improvements in the level of the capitation grant as resources allow.</P>

      <P>The evaluation involves the assessment of pupil performance on standardised tests and baseline data have been collected on the reading and mathematics achievement of pupils in third and sixth classes in Breaking the Cycle schools.  It is proposed to test pupils again in May 2000 in order to assess the effects of the scheme on pupil achievement.</P>
      <P>The evaluation also will involve, over time, the assessment of pupil attainment by examining junior cycle completion rates among former pupils of Breaking the Cycle schools, prior to and following the introduction of the scheme.  Baseline data are also being gathered on the aggregate achievements in the 1997 junior certificate examination of pupils who received their primary education in Breaking the Cycle schools prior to the introduction of the scheme.  This information will provide a basis for assessing the impact of the scheme on performance in the junior certificate examination of pupils currently enrolled in Breaking the Cycle schools.</P>

      <P>The Early Start and the teacher/ counsellor projects are two separate initiatives. Different procedures were used to evaluate each project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Early Start pre-school project which was initiatied in September 1994 and targeted at three <Col N="1344" /> year old children from disadvantaged backgrounds was evaluated by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra.  A standardised test was administered to a control group of junior infants in the original eight Early Start locations in December 1994.  The same test was administered to a random sample of the first Early Start cohort of children in December 1995 when they were in junior infants and again to a sample of the second Early Start cohort in December 1996.</P>
    <P>In 1994 two standardised tests, English reading and mathematics, were administered to a random sample of pupils in second class in the eight original Early Start centres which will enable comparisons to be made between Early Start pupils and the control group as well as between the two Early Start cohorts.  These tests will be administered to samples of the first two Early Start cohorts in December 1998 and in December 1999 respectively when they are in second class.  Also, teachers of junior infants were asked their opinion of Early Start pupils compared with pupils who had not been in Early Start and whom they had taught previously.  Junior infant teachers were also requested to complete a pupil rating form in 1995/96 and again in 1996/97 comparing the pupils in their classes who had been in Early Start with those who were not.</P>
    <P>The teacher/counsellor project was set up in September 1995 on a three year pilot basis to provide an additional resource for schools in supporting pupils with disruptive or withdrawn behaviours.  The method of evaluation which was used involved a report by inspectors in my Department on aspects of the project and the collection of information by questionnaire data from teacher/counsellors, class teachers, school principals, chairpersons of the boards of management and from parents.  The evaluation involved the collection of information about aspects of the teacher/counsellors' work and the inspectors' evaluation of that work as well as the involvement of the other parties in the project and their estimate of the effectiveness of the intervention.</P>

      <P>Lucan Multi-Denominational School was established in September 1997 with temporary recognition.  The purpose of temporary recognition is to enable the school to demonstrate over a period of time that it has a viable future.  During that period, the onus is on the school management to provide temporary accommodation for the school.  My Department normally grant-aids 50 per cent of any reasonable rental charges accruing under this arrangement.</P>
      <P>At the meeting referred to by the Deputy, which was held on the 20 May last, it was agreed, in the context of the current temporary status of the school, that the board of management would address the short to medium term accommodation needs of the school.  In this regard, acquisition of an identified site and placement of temporary accommodation thereon will be pursued by the school authorities.  My Department will assist the school in determining the suitability of the site by allocating a technical staff member to carry out a professional assessment.  This will be organised when a site map has been submitted by the school as agreed.</P>
      <P>The school authorities applied recently for permanent recognitiion for the school and the application is being processed.  The question of permanent accommodation will be addressed when the school receives permanent recognition.  It has been agreed with the school authorities that a second meeting would be more appropriate when the issue of permanent recognition has been finalised and this will be organised accordingly. In the meantime, the school authorities have agreed to keep my Department informed of progress on arrangements for next September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of schools as regards suspension of students is ultimately a matter for interpretation by the courts.  It is my view, however, that school authorities do have the right to suspend students but that students also have rights, in particular a right to fair procedures.  In practice the suspension of students should be carried out with due regard to the rights of all concerned. In the case of suspension of students from primary school, the State also has duties as imposed by the Constitution &mdash; notably the duty to require that, in view of actual conditions, students receive a certain minimum education.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools the suspension of students must be in accordance with the terms of the Rules for National Schools which provide that the maximum initial period of exclusion from school shall be three school days.  A special decision of the board of management is necessary to authorise a further period of exclusion up to a maximum of ten schooldays to allow for consulation with the student's parents.  In exceptional circumstances, the rules provide that the board of management may authorise a further period of exclusion in order to enable the matter to be reviewed.  The rules also provide that no student shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the student at another suitable school.</P>
      <P>In second level schools, matters relating to school discipline and suspension of students are primarily the responsibility of individual schools and my Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in this difficult area.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort and after the rules of natural justice have been applied.  Where students are suspended from school parents have a right of appeal to the school authorities.  If they remain dissatisfied, parents may bring enrolment difficulties to my attention and I, as Minister, will arrange to have appropriate inquiries made with a view to having the pupil concerned re-enter school as soon as possible.  This may involve the inspectorate entering into consultation with the schools in a locality.</P>
      <P>My Department's psychological service is also available to advise schools in relation to students with behavioural difficulties and the appropriate education provision in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general I consider that the procedures relating to suspensions work well in the interests of the students concerned and their fellow students. There are inevitably some difficulties, in particular <Col N="1349" /> some parents may feel that their rights and those of their children are not given sufficient attention.  The Education Bill, which is currently on Committee Stage in this House, aims to create more transparency in decisions by schools by providing that they must publish their policy on admission to and participation in the school.  The Bill also aims to give a statutory basis and entitlement to existing grievance and appeals procedures. It also strengthens those procedures, notably with a new procedure for appeals against suspension and expulsion to a national appeals body.</P>

      <P>Testing practice is not uniform across schools because not all schools use the same standardised test.  Schools are encouraged to monitor their pupils' progress by means of a combination of approaches, including the use of standardised, norm-referenced tests.  The vast majority of primary schools test the progress of their pupils in this way.  It is left to the staff of each school to select the tests to be used for this purpose.  Individual pupils' results are communicated to parents and records of progress are kept within the schools.</P>

      <P>Individual schools test their own pupils' progress in literacy and numeracy using a variety of tests, including standardised tests.  Information on pupil's progress, including those in early primary classes with literacy and numeracy problems, is kept at school level.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of allocating remedial teachers to schools to support students with serious literacy and numeracy problems, it is estimated, as a general rule, that approximately 10 per cent of students will require such remedial teaching support.

The effectiveness of all of these programmes is kept under review by the inspectorate during school inspections.</P>
      <P>The implementation stage of the revised primary curriculum will begin during the next school year and this will be supported by a significant programme of in-career development for teachers.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 281 and 283 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of the number of primary schools, the number of pupils and the number of teachers involved in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project, the disadvantaged areas scheme and the home <Col N="1353" /> school-community liaison scheme are set out in the following table.</P>
    <P>The Breaking the Cycle pilot project involves a total of 33 urban schools and 123 rural schools. Schools included in the rural dimension of the scheme are grouped into 25 local clusters.  Special targeted support packages are made available to schools in the urban and rural dimensions of the scheme, as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Urban Dimension</i>
    </P>
    <P>Grant of up to £3,000 for materials-equipment and grant of up to £4,000 for out of school activities; supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil by virtue of their inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme; 95 per cent building grant; maximum class size of 15:1 in all junior classes; service of curriculum co-ordinator who oversees the project, and special targeted in-career development for school staff.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rural Dimension</i>
    </P>
    <P>Grant of £1,000 for materials-equipment and grant of £1,000 for suitable local initiatives aimed at combating disadvantage; supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil; 95 per cent building grant; each of the 25 clusters of schools has the services of a cluster co-ordinator, and special targeted in-career development for school staff.</P>
    <P>Primary schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and the home-school-community liaison scheme receive the following supports: supplementary capitation funding of £30 per pupil, £9 of which relates to expenditure on <Col N="1354" /> materials-equipment; 95 per cent building grant; television licence refund; maximum class size of 29 pupils; preferential funding rates under the school books rental schemes, and schools in the home-school-community liaison scheme also have the support of a locally based co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level an additional <i>per capita</i> grant of £30 is paid to schools which are categorised as disadvantaged, and a scheme for the provision of assistance in the supply of schoolbooks to necessitous pupils is administered locally by the principal teachers of the participating schools. The provision for this scheme in 1998 is £4.375 million.</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1998, provides for tax relief on personal and company donations which can be made direct to a designated school or to an approved body set up to raise funds for designated schools.</P>
    <P>Under the Act, a designated school means a primary or post-primary school which is in receipt of enhanced grants made by the Minister for Education and Science based on criteria such as the proportion of students in the school who are socially or economically disadvantaged.  In essence, designated schools are those which at primary level, are in one or more of the following schemes &mdash; the disadvantaged areas scheme; Breaking the Cycle; Early Start; home-school-community liaison scheme and teaching counsellor scheme, and, at post-primary level, have been allocated a disadvantaged teaching post by the Department of Education and Science or are in the home-school-community liaison scheme.</P>

      <P>There are currently six primary schools, including the gaelscoil, serving the needs of the Bishopstown-Wilton area of Cork.  Within the past year my Department initiated a consultative process with the two an Spioraid Naoimh schools, Scoil Cholumbáin and Scoil Therese, with a view to establishing a basis for rationalisation.  This initiative arose from the fact that enrolments in two of the schools had declined significantly in recent years and there is a need to provide satisfactory permanent accommodation for Gaelscoil Uí Riada, which has been in temporary accommodation since its establishment.  During the course of the consultative process an urgent need to make provision for special needs pupils emerged.</P>
      <P>The outcome is that agreement has been reached for Scoil Columbáin and Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh boys school to amalgamate in the Spioraid Naomh school complex from next September.  The necessary steps are being taken to ensure the availability of sufficient accommodation to enable the amalgamation to take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scoil an Spioraid Naomh girls and Scoil Therese will continue to operate as independent schools.  The intention is that the Scoil Cholumbáin building will be used for special needs pupils subject to the agreement of the patron.  I have also decided to make funding available for the <Col N="1356" /> building of a new school for the Gaelscoil Uí Riada on the site already purchased by my Department for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the increases which arise under the restructuring pay deals made under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>The position is that the final element of the restructuring pay deals, that concerning in-school management, has only recently been agreed. Arrangements are now being made to pay the arrears of pension and retirement gratuity to eligible pensioners.  It is anticipated that this work will be completed before September 1998.</P>
      <P>Many teachers have already received an increase in their pensions.  These are teachers who retired before the commencement date, 1 July 1994, of the restructuring pay deals.  The Government has decided that such teachers should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis, subject to a minimum increase of 2 per cent in their pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with this decision, an increase of <Col N="1357" /> 2 per cent in pension, together with arrears backdated to 1 May 1996, was issued at the end of January 1998 to retired teachers whose pensions are paid by my Department.  At the same time, vocational education committees were informed that they should authorise the relevant local authority to make similar payments in the case of former vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>With regard to retired vocational teachers in County Mayo, the position is that Mayo County Council has informed my Department that the pension increase of 2 per cent, together with arrears, will be paid at the end of June 1998.</P>

      <P>Equality of access and opportunity for all people, including people who have a disability, is a fundamental principle underlying the operation of the education system at all levels.  In some cases this is supported by legislation while in others administrative practices promote equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first and second levels there is at present no legislation of general application relating to the organisation of education at these levels or to the rights and responsibilities of the various interests. This situation will change upon enactment of the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997.  The Bill, as published, contains a wide range of provisions relating to the education of people with disabilities. In addition, as part of a process of wide-ranging consultation on the Bill, I and officials of my Department have met a large number of groups with an interest or an involvement in the education of people with disabilities.  As a result of those consultations I have brought forward a <Col N="1358" /> number of amendments to the Bill for discussion on Committee Stage to strengthen the Bill further as regards education for people with disabilities. I expect that the Bill will be enacted by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>At third level, the Universities Act, 1997, enacted on 14 May 1997, contains significant provisions relating generally to the issue of equality of opportunity in university education.  The promotion of equality of opportunity is a statutory object of all universities and each university is encouraged to have a charter which sets out its policy in respect of the promotion of equality of opportunity among students and employees. Each university is also obliged to prepare a statement of its policies in respect of access to university education by, among others, people who have a disability and in respect of equality in all its activities.  The Higher Education Authority is given the power to review these policies and their implementation.</P>

      <P>The possible closure of this school came to the notice of my Department recently when the school management sought a meeting to discuss its future.  This meeting was held on 19 May. Two local meetings were held on 21 and 26 May and my Department was informed on 27 May that a firm decision had been taken to close the school.  The decision was taken in the light of declining enrolments.  The school has a total of 127 pupils in the current school year with only 17 new first year pupils due to start next September. The school is to be phased out over a two year period with final closure at the end of the 1999-2000 school year.  There will not be an intake of first year pupils next September.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that a secondary school is a privately owned and managed institution and a decision to close such a school is a matter for the trustees.  My main concern in a school closure is to ensure that the best interests of the pupils are looked after in the period up to closure and that there will be sufficient pupil places in existing schools in the general area for pupils who would have normally enrolled in the closing school.  My Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities to ensure that as little disruption as possible is caused to all concerned by the closure of the school.</P>

      <P>A scheme of additional capitation grants for the provision of caretaking and clerical services in primary schools was introduced in September 1992.</P>
      <P>The current terms of the scheme provide for grant assistance at a rate of £15 per pupil for each service.  School authorities have discretion as to how the grant is to be applied to these services. The grant provided to schools under this scheme is not directly related to any specific pay scale. The grants are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
      <P>The school in question is currently in receipt of £6,270 per annum towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.  This grant is calculated on the basis of an enrolment of 209 pupils, at a rate of £30 per pupil.  Since this is the appropriate amount payable under the terms of the scheme, I regret that it is not open to my Department at this stage to make an additional grant available to this school.  I assure the Deputy that I remain committed to seeking improvements in the level of funding provided under this scheme.</P>

      <P>Traditionally, schools were selected for designation as disadvantaged on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic indicators.  The key factors taken into account included the incidence of unemployment; local authority housing occupancy; and medical card holding among the parents of the children concerned.</P>
      <P>The study to which the Deputy refers was conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre and involved a detailed review of current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Among the key issues raised in the study was a concern that the traditional criteria had insufficient regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage. Also, that specific regard should be had to the educational attainment of parents as a factor which can have a significant impact on their children's participation in the education system.</P>
      <P>The study recommended that the traditional criteria be amended to better reflect the above concerns.  The study also recommended that disadvantaged area status be confined to 16 per cent of the schoolgoing population.  In this connection, it was noted that disadvantaged status was already extended to in excess of 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an alternative to extending disadvantaged status to additional schools, the study recommended that available resources be targeted specifically on the most disadvantaged schools. <Col N="1363" /> This recommendation was reflected in the Breaking the Cycle programme which was introduced in selected urban and rural schools in 1995.</P>
    <P>Schools were selected for inclusion in this programme on the basis of revised criteria which were devised by the Education Research Centre. In addition to taking account of the traditional criteria mentioned above, these new criteria also took account of the following factors: the number of pupils whose mother or father did not take at least the group or intermediate certificate examination; and the number of pupils from families in receipt of assistance because of limited means from farm incomes.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that disadvantaged area status has not been extended to additional primary or second level schools since 1994.</P>

      <P>The student support schemes, i.e. the higher education grant scheme, the vocational education scholarship scheme and the ESF maintenance scheme, at present apply to students pursuing full-time courses in approved institutions. Any decision to extend the schemes to students pursuing part-time courses, including evening and modular courses, would have to be made in the light of available financial resources and competing needs in the education sector.</P>
      <P>The academic year 1995/96 is the latest year for which my Department has complete figures of the number of third level students.  In that year, there were almost 22,000 part-time students at third level.  The provision of maintenance grants schemes to include part-time students would involve substantial additional expenditure.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to extend the student support schemes to part-time students would have to have regard to overall resource constraints and other competing needs in the education sector.  I would hope that, as resources become available, it will be possible to provide more Exchequer support for third level undergraduate students attending courses on a part-time basis.</P>
      <P>In their report the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, referred to the profile of part-time students and noted that almost 90 per cent were in employment.

      <P>I am aware of the debate concerning the best method of teaching deaf children and the changes in methods that have occurred over the <Col N="1366" /> years.  Signing gave way to oral methods and in the last 20 years total communication became the principal approach.  Signing and bilingualism are being debated again now.</P>
      <P>I have met representatives of the Irish Deaf Society who have informed me of the views of the parents they represent and I know they favour signing as a first language for deaf children. Many factors must be considered when decisions are being made in regard to any change in this important matter of teaching approach.  Signing is taught to some pupils in this country where this is thought to be the best system of communication for them, taking all their needs and abilities into consideration.</P>
      <P>Having considered the representations from the Irish Deaf Society, I have proposed a number of amendments to the Education (No. 2) Bill which aim to address its concerns.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the use of sign language is an option in the teaching of deaf children in Sweden and Denmark.  This matter was raised during the Committee Stage of the debate on the Education (No. 2) Bill and I agreed to arrange a visit by officials to Sweden to investigate the teaching of sign language there.  I intend to ensure that this visit is made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 312 and 313 together.</P>
      <P>The staffing of a national school in any particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September in the previous school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment at Sunday's Well girls national school on 30 September 1998 was 207.  This entitles the school to a principal and six teachers <Col N="1367" /> for the 1989-99 school year.  An enrolment of 215 pupils would have been required to retain the seventh teacher.  In the circumstances, I regret that the school will lose the services of the seventh teacher at the end of the current school year.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the school in question has made application to my Department for a resource teacher post.  My Department is currently considering a number of applications for such posts.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be considered in the context of any additional resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken for the forthcoming school year.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of the case made by the school for the allocation of a concessionary teacher post to address problems of educational disadvantage in the school.  It is my understanding that both the boys and girls schools in question are included in the disadvantaged areas scheme for funding purposes only and that neither school is currently in receipt of a concessionary teacher post.</P>
    <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problems of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools in question will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 318 and 319 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, the candidates' reckonable income for the purpose of the means test is their gross income from all sources and the gross income of their parents or guardians where applicable. Where a candidate's parents are separated, only the income of the parent with whom the candidate resides is assessed.  The terms of the third level student support schemes, which are uniformly applied, do not allow for personal expenses such as mortgage or loan repayments to be taken into account when assessing income.</P>
      <P>In the particular instance referred to by the Deputy the gross income exceeded the limits to qualify for a maintenance grant set down in the 1997 higher education grants scheme.  However both students qualify to have their student services charge paid and they are also entitled to have their fees paid under the free fees initiative.</P>

      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995/96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995/96 and 1996/97 academic years and set for review this academic year.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the charges would on average amount to £400 in 1997/98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997/98 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out the students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested <Col N="1371" /> student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the charge payable by students for registration, exams and student services, is a matter for the third level institution involved.  When I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge, from £150 to £250, for the current academic year, I was concerned about that portion of the charge which is intended to fund student services and in particular the lack of transparent procedures.  Accordingly, I requested the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency <Col N="1372" /> and accountability.  The working group has completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.</P>
    <P>This framework consists of guidelines to establish an appropriate system of consultation with students in the allocation of funding from the £250 charge and in the determination of student services to be funded from this source.  In relation to the issue of transparency, the framework recommends that each institution should provide information as to the allocation of the £250 charge towards exams/registration and towards student services on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the framework will be adopted by the various institutions involved and I have asked the Higher Education Authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, as recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.</P>
    <P>I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>
