      <P>Yesterday I requested the Taoi-seach to provide Government time for a debate on the critical situation facing the farming community where incomes have fallen substantially. Before agreeing to take any matter without debate I would like an assurance from the Taoi-seach that Government time will be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday in response to the leader of the Labour Party, the Taoiseach indicated Government and cross party support for a full investigation of the matters brought to light with regard to non-resident account holders.  Not-withstanding a comment in a national newspaper today that there is a reluctance to do this, will the Taoiseach again reassure the House that what-ever powers are required to fully ventilate this issue will be given to the Committee of Public Accounts?  Is it the Government's intention to bring a motion before the House under section 5 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1995, and section 23 of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act, 1923, to ensure that there is a full independent investigation of all these matters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated yesterday when we discussed the motion on the Order Paper in the name of Labour Party Members &mdash; it is still on the Order Paper &mdash; or when we discussed the suggestions put by Deputy John Bruton on Tuesday on the legislation for the Comptroller and Auditor General, I am in favour of the intent behind this investigation.</P>
      <P>I understand the Committee of Public Accounts has commenced work on the matter and that its investigation is proceeding satisfactorily.  I also understand the committee has no difficulty in getting personnel from the banks or the Revenue Commissioners or anybody else to cooperate.  We will allow that course to proceed.  If the members of the committee have a difficulty they have stated that the chairman will explain their requirements to the Government.  At that stage the Government will consider what is necessary and the matter can be debated in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important it is clearly understood by all, that there is a will in this House across all parties to have this matter fully investigated and that whatever powers are required by the Committee of Public Accounts to have a full investigation will be willingly approved by all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach first commented on this matter last Sunday and Monday he suggested a strongly interventionist role where any tax due would be paid.  The Minister for Finance yesterday said he effectively had no function in the matter.  Which is the Government's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I first spoke on these recent revelations when they came to light a week ago. I spoke in the same terms last April.  Yesterday the Minister for Finance said it was not open to a Minister for Finance to query individual cases with the Revenue Commissioners.  The Deputy would know that to be the case; certainly his party leader, who was a Minister for Finance, would know it to be the case.  A Minister for Finance <Col N="515" /> does not engage and has never engaged in individual cases with the Revenue Commissioners. I do not believe a Minister for Finance has queried the Revenue Commissioners about an individual case since the foundation of the State.  In so far as there are outstanding liabilities to the State, Deputy Noonan was correct in what he said.  I said last week that outstanding liabilities to the State must be collected and there are adequate powers to do that.  If the Revenue Commissioners consider they do not have adequate powers, there is a standard check between officials of the Department and Finance and the Revenue Commissioners every year when the Finance Bill is prepared to ascertain if additional powers are required and, if that is the case, they will be given to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask about a separate matter concerning the Taoiseach's replies to questions yesterday.  Deputy Bruton may have a question on the matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that, to the extent that policy considerations concerning capital flight might have influenced the approach taken by the Revenue Commissioners on the collection of taxes in these cases, any governmental advice to the Revenue Commissioners on such a policy consideration will also be open to question by the committee that considers the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To what is the Deputy referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the Government might not have wanted money to leave Irish banks in 1990 or 1991 and, therefore, went easy on the tax collection aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners as to what powers they may seek. As the Deputy will know, there is always a concern that policy changes may create difficulties concerning capital flight.  That has always been a concern of the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy would be a matter for the Minister, not the Revenue Commissioners.  If, therefore, policy considerations were involved, would the Minister in question be willing to give evidence on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's questions are hypothetical.  I am sure if the Committee of Public <Col N="516" /> Accounts has reasons to request somebody to appear before it, it should make that request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> In regard to the Taoiseach's stated intention that taxes evaded by Allied Irish Banks must be collected, does he consider the £100,000 the two Government parties got from Allied Irish Banks in the early 1990s should be paid as a downpayment to the Revenue Commissioners on the £80 million owing?</P>

      <P>During yesterday's Question Time the Taoiseach referred to the Government's intention to introduce legislation to reform local government and stated that it would include a provision for regional government.  Will he indicate when that legislation will be introduced? Does he intend to publish the Government thinking on regional government, which seems to be a new aspect of local government, that will introduced?  Will he permit a debate on Structural Funding next week rather than in two weeks' time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a debate on that Bill for almost half an hour yesterday.  I told the Deputy the Bill would be ready in early 1999 and <Col N="517" /> the position did not change overnight.  It will still be available in early 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We need a debate on Structural Funds next week before the Government makes a decision on this matter.  Will the Taoiseach allow Government time to debate that matter next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the Deputy's question about proposed legislation.  Requests about debates should be made through his party's Whip.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach indicated on yesterday's Order of Business that no legislation would be required on the new round of Structural Funds and that they would be provided for by administrative order.  Is that still the case or are we talking about legislation to regionalise the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about two separate matters.  What I said yesterday was correct. Deputy De Rossa was trying to find another way to raise the issue and he asked about the proposed legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday, in response to a question from Deputy Bruton, that local government included regional government and that the proposed legislation would cover both.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to allow a debate next week on Structural Funding and the question of regionalising the country and, if not, why?  What is he afraid of?</P>

      <P>Yesterday a court found there was no place to detain a juvenile who required placement in custodial care.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the education welfare Bill will ensure children in need of custodial care and education are assured a place on an adequate basis and that we will not have a continuous row of children coming before our courts when there are no places for them?</P>

      <P>To give the time honoured response whenever this matter is raised, the courts are independent.  That is the cornerstone of our democracy.  The Law Reform Commission has given this matter some consideration recently. There has been some debate on it between the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Attorney General has considered the matter over a number of months.  He will continue to pursue it, but it is at a very preliminary stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware the legislation is down the line.  However, why can it not be addressed before 2000?  It is an amendment to the Foreshore Acts and the preparations have been going on for about 30 years.  Why is no date specified, even for the preparation of the heads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason stated by the Department is that the legislation is to establish a new legal framework for the management of the coastal zone and to replace all the Offshore Acts, which the Department says is an extremely complex area.  It will take at least a year for it to devise a general scheme, which will be the end of 1999.  The heads will take at least another year to prepare.</P>

The Patents (Amendment) Bill which will implement the agreement on trade related aspects of the Intellectual Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will be available next year.  The heads of the Bill have been drafted in the Department.  I am informed by one of my colleagues that it is hoped the Green Paper will be ready in November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the adjournment of this debate I had begun my introduction of this Bill which has a specific purpose to deal with a specific problem brought to my attention by the Voluntary Health Insurance.  This legislation is required for it to remain competitive in a particular area of the private health insurance market.  This cannot be resolved by way of regulation but, on the advice of the Attorney General, requires an amendment to the parent Act.</P>
      <P>Up until now VHI members who have spent time living abroad as part of their job have relied either upon the public health system in the foreign country or have arranged private health care insurance overseas &mdash; something that may prove awkward or inconvenient to arrange.  Market research by VHI identified a demand among its members for a health insurance product that will provide those who reside temporarily outside the State with comprehensive cover for their health care costs.  The Bill enables the VHI to meet that demand by acting as agent for the sale of an international health care plan.</P>
      <P>This short Bill is essentially concerned with enabling the board to offer an additional product to its members, which takes account of expressed customer need.  Arrangements to be put in place by VHI on foot of the proposed legislation puts an additional service at the disposal of members in order to form a seamless continuation of their VHI membership on their return from residing temporarily abroad.</P>
      <P>Section 1 provides for the VHI board to have the power to act as an agent for an insurer in the sale of an international health care plan.  The section provides that the board will simply require my consent to exercise its power to act as agent in the terms specified in the Bill.  The section contains a definition empowering the VHI to hold an appointment as agent for an insurer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 also sets a certain reasonable limitation on the type of undertaking in respect of which the VHI may act as agent.  It defines an &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; as the holder of an authorisation within <Col N="522" /> the meaning of the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994.  This means the insurer concerned will have been duly notified to our central competent authority for insurance business, having already satisfied the competent insurance authority in the member state of establishment of its capacity to conduct the class of insurance business concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines an international health care plan in terms of providing for the making of payments in relation to costs incurred in the provision of medical, surgical or related services.  It further defines such a plan as being applicable to persons who will reside outside the State for such periods as the board may specify therein.  Section 2 provides that the board, for the purposes of the powers granted under the Bill, will be subject to Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The VHI Act, 1957, provided that the board was not to be subject to the provisions of the Insurance Acts.  However, as the Bill proposes to assign to the board the power to act as agent for an insurer, it was considered, and is provided for under section 2, that it must comply with the provisions of Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989, which provides for the regulation of insurance intermediaries.  The board has advised that it does not envisage any difficulty in complying with this provision.  Sections 3 and 4 contain standard provisions relating to expenses and citation, respectively.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to act as agent in the making available of health insurance to persons who will be resident outside the State for temporary periods.  It is necessary to amend the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, 1957 and 1996, in order to empower the board to act as agent to make available an international health care plan.  The VHI board made strong representations that it must be able to offer an international health care plan to corporate and individual clients as soon as possible, if it is not to be vulnerable to competitive challenge.  I am responding to that request.</P>
    <P>The international health care plan to be made available pursuant to the legislation will be based on an agreement between the board and a major international insurer.  It will be a matter for the board to negotiate the necessary agency arrangements, practical and financial, with the insurer concerned.</P>
    <P>The international health care plan will be available to people who intend to live and work outside the jurisdiction for periods of typically more than six months and up to five years.  The plan's main features will be medical insurance cover, evacuation and repatriation services and medical assistance services.  As the plan's principal purpose will be insurance against the cost of health care delivered outside the State, it will not be subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> Act, 1994, which requires, <i>inter alia</i>, that premiums be community rated.</P>
    <P>People currently insured with the VHI will be able to transfer to the international health care plan without waiting periods or pre-existing illness restrictions, provided they have served out the restrictions applicable under their existing cover.  They will be transferred back to their former VHI plans on the same terms when they return to Ireland.  The VHI will market the international health care plan through its existing group scheme network and it will be available to both group and individual members.  This aims to be a particularly customer-friendly arrangement for people who must reside outside the State from time to time in connection with their employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is specific in nature and does not attempt to deal with issues other than the requirements of the board regarding its capacity to offer an international health care plan.  My Department is preparing a White Paper on private health insurance which will address the broader issues. In accordance with commitments contained in the Government's action programme, the White Paper will address the options open in relation to the VHI's future, including the question of a strategic alliance.  I have made it known on a number of occasions that all options are being considered in relation to the most appropriate status and corporate structure for the VHI into the future.  This matter has been the subject of extensive consultation between officials of my Department and senior management of the VHI.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects the necessity of ensuring the VHI can function competitively in a particular area of business and that it is not disadvantaged, <i>vis-à-vis</i> competitors, in relation to a growing segment of the market.  As well as meeting specific customer demands, the capacity to make available an international health care plan will ensure the VHI is equipped to consolidate its existing business in the corporate sector by putting it on the same footing as other insurers which can offer plans of the kind involved.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will enable the board to offer a necessary product in a developing and demanding market.  The product in many ways reflects this country's growing international outlook. It was not possible to envisage that the board would be required to offer such a product when the 1957 Voluntary Health Insurance Act was framed.  It reflects the pace of change in the private medical insurance market since the passing of the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996, brought about by opening the market to competition and is an indication of the benefits which competition can bring to consumers.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will not oppose the Bill in principle and has no objection to its contents but the fact that it is necessary for the Minister to enact legislation to allow the Voluntary Health <Col N="524" /> Insurance board to make available on the market a new product, which is desirable and in the interests of the consumer as well as the board, is indicative of the straitjacket within which the VHI must operate.  The time has come for a radical change in the structures relating to the VHI and the manner in which we deal with health insurance.</P>
      <P>It is no longer tenable for the Minister to continue to perform the compatible and contradictory roles of regulator of private health insurance, owner of the VHI and price fixer for private beds in public hospitals.  The profound conflicts of interests which result from this trilogy of disparate functions is a contributory factor to the increasing cost of health insurance and medical inflation.  Last January the Minister announced increased charges for private beds in public hospitals.  Some months later a substantial increase in insurance premiums was announced by the VHI.  The Minister cannot say, on the one hand, that he is anxious that health insurance premiums are kept within reasonable financial boundaries and, on the other, ignore the fact that his actions have directly contributed to making health insurance more expensive.</P>
      <P>In that context it is worth recording the conclusions of the advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme.  It predicts that, if the cost of health insurance continues to escalate, the inevitable consequence will be that it will fall outside the financial capacities of many of those currently insured.  The public health system cannot cope with the pressures being imposed on it.  The only reason they are not greater derives from the fact that in excess of 40 per cent of the population are insured through health insurance schemes, the vast majority with the VHI and smaller numbers with BUPA.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed these issues.  It is appreciated that he referred to the White Paper but it is something of a mystery that, in the context of all aspects of the health services as they extend from health insurance, public hospital health care and a variety of other areas, he is incapable of making the necessary decisions to develop the health services.  There is an endless stream of committees and specialist groups examining every issue that falls on the Minister's lap, including the management of the hospital system, future functions, legislation applicable to health insurance and waiting lists, the majority of whose recommendations the Minister tries to keep secretly hidden.  He leaks selected portions to portray himself in a good light whenever there is controversy.  The same applies to the way in which he is dealing with the health insurance issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper will provide some valuable insights into how the health insurance system should progress but to date the Minister appears to have ignored all the advice, recommendations and conclusions of the report of the advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme.  It recommended that the trilogy of conflicting functions <Col N="525" /> performed by the Minister should be tackled at an early stage.  European law requires insurance industry regulators to be independent of industry owners.  The advisory group recommended that an independent health insurance authority be established as a matter of urgency.  There is no reason the Minister cannot advance that recommendation by bringing the necessary legislation before the House this term.  Such an authority would be responsible for the financial monitoring of health insurance, the licensing of new health insurers and ensuring the market delivers cost-effective care.  The relationship between the VHI and the State discourages the emergence of new entrants into the market as there is a perception that the market remains one in which all insurers do not have an equal relationship with the various State agencies and do not play on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government decided whether the VHI is to remain in State ownership or whether it is to be permitted to take on a strategic partner. It is incompatible with the Minister's function as regulator of health insurance that it should remain within his competence and, as we move towards the Estimates and a new budget, that he should again consider whether to impose additional charges on private beds in public hospitals.  The report of the advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme recommended that in order to allow a free market to evolve the Department of Health and Children should allow public hospitals to set the price of those beds in them which are designated as private.  The report envisaged the possibility of greater efficiency in our hospital system and some competition in the market to ensure good health services are provided in an economically acceptable way.</P>
    <P>I realise we will return to many other issues of concern in the health insurance area but I must comment on one or two issues of great concern. One is an anomaly which derives from our view of the health services in decades gone by.  One of the curiosities of health insurance is that an insured person will find that hospital in-care under a psychiatrist is covered by Voluntary Health Insurance schemes but no recognition is given to the position of psychologists who have played, and will continue to play, a very important health role within the system.  It is time that VHI adapted its policies to provide cover for treatment by psychologists.  The need to provide for a more flexible form of health insurance for those using private services such as dental services must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the context of the debate in Private Members' time on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings I refer to the capacity of our hospitals to cope with patients' needs.  One of the reasons there is not an even greater public outcry about the state of the public hospital waiting lists is that 40 per cent of the population have private health insurance &mdash; the majority with VHI and some with BUPA.  Their reason for being insured is not to ensure greater comfort during a stay in <Col N="526" /> hospital.  All research has shown that the primary reason people resort to private health insurance, despite their entitlement to public hospital care, is that they see it as a means of gaining speedier access to health care when it is needed.  In 98 per cent of instances the same consultants provide private and public health care.  The quality of care does not differ for public and private patients. What differs is the speed of access.  It is a tragic commentary on our public health service that the majority of people who rely on private health insurance do so because of their perception that if their lives are at risk they will have speedier access to consultancy and in-patient hospital services than if they rely on the public health care system.</P>
    <P>The increase in population that is occurring as a result of the effective end of emigration and the return of immigrants will place increasing pressures not only on the public health care system but also on the private system which up to now has provided almost immediate access to consultants and in-patient hospital care when required.  We must radically rethink the manner in which our hospital services are provided and the Minister must introduce some of the measures debated over the past two evenings in this House.  I did not have time to put on the record of the House all the measures proposed by Fine Gael in the document which we have published.  We have not yet seen the full report of the working group on hospital waiting lists.  Unless the measures recommended by the working group are implemented we will have difficulties not only in the public hospital system but in private medical care as well.  We are, at greater speed than many realise, reaching a position where those who have health insurance will find that they too are being put on waiting lists for private hospital care.  That will have a further impact on the public hospital health system.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not seem to have any proposals to address these problems which are rapidly arising.  I am concerned that another committee may be required to sit for another year or two to address this issue.  We need a new dynamic from the Minister and his Department in comprehensively addressing the development of our medical services and the interraction between public and private health care and between the provision of public health care and the health insurance schemes so that we have a vision of the health service we want for the State in the new millennium.  There is no such vision.  There are strategic statements from the Department of Health and Children with wish lists which appear to give priority to patients.  However, many patients feel that their ill-health is not given priority by this Minister.</P>
    <P>I reiterate what I have said on other occasions, that an extraordinarily good service is provided by doctors, both consultants and general practitioners, and nurses.  All too often they are not given the praise they deserve.  On occasions when problems with the health service are raised and <Col N="527" /> criticisms of it voiced it behoves those of us who do so to state our belief that unfair and unnecessary pressures are placed on doctors and nurses in our hospital system.  These pressures derive from lack of vision on the part of this Minister and his Department in failing to predict where we will go in the future.  Far too frequently decisions in the health service are made on a fire brigade basis when problems have emerged which could have been anticipated.</P>
    <P>I am fully in support of community rating and I do not wish anything I say in that context to be misunderstood.  However, one of the submissions made to the Minister expresses the view, in the context of providing more flexibility within the insurance market, that community rating should not be mandatory for health insurance contracts which relate solely to ancillary health services.  It has been suggested that a different approach would facilitate the development of products to finance and manage primary care and also dental care which is an issue I mentioned previously. This very basic consumer issue must be addressed.  Consumers are confronted by the advertising battle which goes on between VHI and BUPA and which will no doubt occur in the event of another insurer coming into the market.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people using health insurance products often do not understand what they are covered for and are bemused at what are supposed to be the differences and the benefits of being insured as between the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and BUPA.  I suspect that both insurance companies have a vested interest in ensuring there is a degree of confusion among consumers in spelling out the exact similarities and differences, and the benefits and disadvantages of different products.</P>
    <P>A key difficulty for consumers is that the cover provided by health insurance contracts is complex. Different plans are presented in different ways and it is difficult, if not impossible, for an individual outside the industry to compare the contracts on offer in terms of the benefits provided and value for money.  It should be a regulatory requirement that health insurance contracts be presented in a standard format using standard terminology.  There should be a clear understanding among consumers of the differing benefits and disadvantages of the various policies on offer and the different premiums charged by each of the insurance bodies previously in the market.  Similar recommendations were made by the Director General of Fair Trading in the United Kingdom in his reviews of the UK health insurance market.</P>
    <P>In the context of the supervisory role, I have said in the past and I repeat now that as the current owner of the major health insurance body in the State, it is not appropriate that the Minister play a supervisory role.  The health insurers should be subject to financial supervision by the Department of Public Enterprise which is the appropriate body to deal with the supervision of health insurers.  It is necessary that that change be <Col N="528" /> made for Ireland to comply with our European Union obligations.</P>
    <P>We are told the White Paper will be available at the end of the year.  Presumably, when it is available the Minister will do what he now apparently intends to do with the working group report on hospital waiting lists.  He will say he wants to consult all the interests concerned and obtain their views.  He will also want to consult with his colleagues and by the time all that happens it will be the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister make the decision this year and, if necessary, introduce a short legislative measure to give the supervisory function to the Department of Public Enterprise?  Until a different supervisor to that of the Department of Health and Children is put in place, we will not see new insurers in the market, and it is in the interest of consumers that the market be more competitive than it is today and that additional insurers are attracted into it.  There should not be a perception in the market that the Minister for Health and Children and the Department are giving some preference to the VHI in the context of health insurance.  It is unfortunate that that is the case.</P>
    <P>In this, as in other areas, the Minister should stop playing the role of a spectator watching the players on the field and start making the decisions necessary to confront a variety of health issues in the health insurance area that must be addressed as we enter a new millennium.  Those decisions are necessary to ensure that the consumers who look to health insurers are provided with the best possible health insurance cover at the best possible price so that they can get the best possible medical service.</P>
    <P>If the Minister fails to address these issues, the inevitable consequence is that there will be even greater pressures on the public health service.  In recent years we have seen an increase in the numbers of people taking up health insurance.  The Minister should be aware, however, that if the economic ill winds currently hitting large parts of the world hit this State, and if, from a position of employment growth, we enter into a position of job losses, a large number of the people newly signed up for health insurance will examine the cost to them of what is on offer and the benefits that might accrue to them and may terminate their contribution to health insurance and look to the public hospital system, a system that currently cannot cope with the demands made on it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to urgently address these issues.  When he concludes the debate, I ask him to confirm the exact date the White Paper will be published, that it will be published within a matter of days of his receiving it and that he will not sit on it for months and selectively leak parts of it to see what the likely public reaction might be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments will be brief because the Bill is short and specific in its provisions. In so far as the Bill allows the VHI provide <Col N="529" /> a specific product, the Labour Party will support it.</P>
      <P>This specific provision has been requested by the VHI.  The Minister is correct in acting on this request and allowing the VHI the freedom to act as an agent in the provision of an international health care product.  When the VHI was set up, the need for such a product was not envisaged but with greater economic growth and more people going abroad for short periods in relation to their work, the need is now acute, and I welcome the fact that the VHI will be allowed to provide it.</P>
      <P>Why is the Bill so limited in its scope?  What will happen if the VHI wants to provide another product in six months' time?  It would have made more sense to give the VHI freedom to operate commercially over the next two years and provide a range of products because at the end of that time the market will be opened up completely.  I do not understand the reason the Bill is so restrictive. Is it not possible to open up the areas in which the VHI could operate?  That would be more sensible because the VHI is shackled by the provisions of the Act and I do not see why those shackles cannot be removed for the next two years.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other products the VHI should provide.  That it is doing little or nothing in the area of promoting a healthy lifestyle is unfortunate.  Private health insurers will have to become more involved in this area and also in screening for various diseases.  This approach to health care is very cost effective and I would like to see it permeate all our health services, both private and public.</P>
      <P>Are there any implications for BUPA in allowing the VHI sell this product?  That is not clear in the Bill and I would like clarification of that from the Minister.</P>
      <P>On the future of the health insurance market, I look forward to the publication of the White Paper.  Like Deputy Shatter, I ask the Minister to be specific about the timescale he has in mind for its publication.  Will it be published immediately or will the Minister sit on it for a lengthy period during which all debate will be stifled?  I urge the Minister to be clear about his commitments and put the White Paper into the public domain as soon as it is available.  I look forward to the publication of the White Paper on the future of the private health insurance market.  Like Deputy Shatter, I ask the Minister to be specific about the timescale he has in mind for its production. Will it be published straight away or will the Minister sit on it for a lengthy period stifling all debate?  I urge the Minister to be clear about his commitments and to put that White Paper into the public domain as soon as it is available.</P>
      <P>I look forward to that debate because there is a number of issues to be addressed, important issues such as the future of VHI and under-capitalisation. VHI outlined the options and we would like to hear the Minister's view on them. That is why the White Paper is long awaited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> A further issue is that of a strategic partner. This is possible but I would like mutualisation of the company to be examined.  I hope that will form a major part of the White Paper's contribution to the debate on the future of VHI.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the prospect of the State providing the £70 million in capitalisation which VHI requires.  I would not hesitate to compliment VHI on the work it has done and the tremendous service it has provided over the years, but I have serious reservations about making a substantial injection of public funds into private health care at a time when public health services are under-funded.  The serious problems confronting the health service have been debated in this House.  Many of those areas are now reaching breaking point and the Minister is under obligation to take drastic action to deal with them. We expect a substantial improvement in the financial allocation to the health services in the upcoming budget.  These are serious reservations about the prospect of providing additional funding to private health care at a time when the public health service is being starved of funding.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to debate the future of private health insurance without looking at the wider context of the future of the health services.  I would like to see a White Paper on that.  Is it the Government's intention to continue to encourage the development of a two tier health service?  Is it looking at any alternatives to that?  When VHI was set up, its purpose was to provide health cover to people who did not have an entitlement to the health services.  VHI now pays £300 via premiums towards the cost of health care in this State.  That was not the intention when VHI was established.  Will we continue along that route where more and more people seek to provide for their own health cover?</P>
    <P>What about those who already pay health contributions via their PRSI, who pay into what is supposed to be a health cover scheme which they know is of little merit?  The scheme only provides entitlement if they can afford to wait for three years, their health problem is not urgent and they are prepared to go onto a waiting list.  People are contributing to private health insurance to be assured of getting treatment in the event of becoming ill.  I urge the Minister to give some thought to the future development of the health services in general.  I hope the future of private health insurance can be debated in the context of the Minister's plans for the health services.</P>
    <P>Who is picking up the tab for various costs in health?  I mentioned those who pay a health contribution through PRSI but there is also the question of public health services subsidising private health care in hospitals.  It would be worth our while to shed some light on consultants' contracts and the manner in which they balance their public and private work.  The public is entitled to know what they are getting for the money paid to consultants on very high salary scales, what level of public work they do for the £70,000 they are paid from the public purse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> We need to be clear about the cross-subsidisation taking place.  We need to know the facts about it within private health insurance and the extent to which people who are in the A and B schemes are subsidising those on the more expensive schemes.  There are people availing of very costly health services in the Mater Private Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic.  Who is paying for those services, services which are available instantly with the best possible doctors, level of care and accommodation?  What is the breakdown of the costs?  Is it a case that people who are paying for the minimum level of cover could be subsidising those who receive first class cover in private hospitals?</P>
    <P>There should be clear information on bed costs.  Who sets them?  Is it acceptable that the Minister has no clear role in that?  It is left to the hospitals, VHI and BUPA to work that out.  The whole area of costs in the health services needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  We should know why hospital beds cost so much.  An analysis of the use of hospital beds and the mix of public and private is required.  The public does not know much about these areas.  There is so much medical politics that it is necessary to open this area up to debate and provide the figures to show who is paying for what.</P>
    <P>There could be more effective usage of beds in public hospitals.  A deplorable situation exists at the moment where beds are controlled by consultants. Often it is in a consultant's interest to use those beds for private patients.  Consultants hold far too much power over the way in which hospitals are run and the patients who are treated.  I would like the Minister to address that &mdash; it is not an appealing job but it must be done. It has been overlooked by successive Ministers for Health but it is time we addressed the issue of control in the medical services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the development of private health insurance and the White Paper we have been promised, it is clearly in the consumer's interest to encourage competition and I hope other private health companies will enter the market.  It is essential for the development of that market that the three core principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover are adhered to and that there should be no deviation from those principles.  We need rigorous implementation of risk equalisation.  That is essential for the future of VHI and the maintenance of a level playing field.  Sometimes people who believe that we should have competition at all costs talk about doing away with these shackles to provide a level playing field.  To have a level playing pitch it is essential to have a risk equalisation scheme, otherwise there would be a tendency to cherry pick.  That can be done in many subtle ways.</P>
    <P>New companies coming into the market can encourage younger people who would be low risk to join.  Also there are subtle ways of discouraging older higher risk people from joining.  The reality <Col N="532" /> is that once a person has signed up as a customer of one company they are unlikely to change. There is a strong customer loyalty and people usually stick with their original company. Obviously some people have moved from the VHI to BUPA but, by and large people, stick with the company with which they started.  Unless a rigorous equalisation scheme is implemented there will be a tendency for new companies to cherry pick and the longer established companies will be left with the higher risk.  I support risk equalisation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill and its limited provisions.  I would have liked it to go further and it is unfortunate that it is so specific.  Will the Minister give a commitment to publish the White Paper on the future of health insurance, when completed, and make it available to Members to allow for a full debate?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1998.  While I would like to refer to some of the specific provisions in the legislation, I shall touch on some of the broader aspects concerning health insurance and its related problems.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Voluntary Health Insurance board to act as an agent in the making available of health insurance to persons who will be resident outside the State for temporary periods.  The Bill is being introduced following receipt of advices from the Attorney General that an amendment would be required to the Voluntary Health Acts, 1957 and 1996, to empower the board to act as an agent for the making available of an international health care plan.  The VHI has made strong representations to the Government on this issue so that it can offer an international health care plan to individual clients as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>An international health care plan made available pursuant to the legislation would be based on an agreement between the board and a major international insurer.  Under the plan, the responsibilities and liabilities involved in providing the benefits covered would fall exclusively to the international insurer.  The premiums applicable under the plan would be set by an arrangement between the VHI and the international insurer.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements envisaged, the board would market and sell the plan to its clients.  The plan would also ensure easy mobility for the client between the VHI cover in the State and cover under the plan.  This would be a particularly customer friendly arrangement in the case of people who must reside outside the State from time to time in connection with their employment. The arrangement envisaged will involve the VHI having a share in excess premium income over claims expenditure.  While the start-up will involve limited initial outlay by the VHI, it anticipates an early stream of modest income from the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill addresses only the specific issue of acting <Col N="533" /> as an agent for such an international health care plan.  The VHI's future role and corporate status is being considered in the context of the preparation of the White Paper on private health insurance.</P>
    <P>I would support competition in the health insurance market if I was convinced it would result in cheaper premiums, while guaranteeing quality health care to all subscribers.  This is a thorny and contentious subject.  The Government considers a policy known as &ldquo;risk equalisation&rdquo; should be introduced.  Next year's payment to the VHI is part of the Government's risk equalisation policy under which companies which have a younger subscriber base, less prone to sickness, must compensate companies with a subscriber base made up of older members.  An expert group appointed by the Government concluded that risk equalisation measures were a barrier to entry into the health insurance market.  The Government, on this occasion, has taken the view that the public good must override the need for more competition in the health sector.</P>
    <P>All these issues will be discussed and analysed in greater detail as part of the White Paper on private health insurance, which is due for publication in the near future.  The balance that must be struck if more competition is to be introduced in the sector providing health care must relate to the introduction of cheaper premia, while guaranteeing quality health care at all times to all subscribers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government is introducing a White Paper on private medical health insurance which I am confident will address the thorny problems of health insurance in a balanced and even-handed manner.  The Minister for Health has stated that he has received 70 submissions on the White Paper and that officials from the Department of Health and Children have met with over 20 bodies to discuss their respective submissions.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that whether one looks at the issue from the perspective of the public health services or private health services, the patient must always come first.  This must be the overriding principle of any policy implemented by the Government or local health boards.</P>
    <P>Hospitals and health care institutions exist to serve the needs of patients.  At times they serve other purposes also.  They are the places where doctors, nurses and other staff who participate in or support the process of health care work. Hospitals are the places where the next generation of the caring profession receive much of their training.  They provide stable, well paid employment in the towns and cities which they serve and are significant generators of economic activity.  The simultaneous fulfilment of these various roles can obscure the central reason for their existence, which is to protect and enhance the health of patients.</P>
    <P>The White Paper must contain concrete proposals which put the health of the patients first. When supporting the principle that the patient <Col N="534" /> always comes first, the Government must continue to make efforts to reduce the waiting lists. There have been some developments in relation to the June figures for waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Since taking office the Government has allocated £12 million for waiting list procedures, which is a 50 per cent increase on the allocation provided by the previous Government.  In April 1998 the Government established a review group on waiting lists.  The group is to examine the underlying causes of waiting lists and waiting times and how best the problems in these areas might be addressed.  The review committee has forwarded its recommendations to the Government for its consideration.  The report's contents are the subject of consultation between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance.  I hope the budget increases to combat waiting lists will be made in the context of the Estimates, as well as in the context of the review to reduce waiting lists.  There can be no quick fix to the problem of waiting lists and financial support must be made available if short-term, medium-term and and long-term programmes are to be put in place to shorten them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to redress regional imbalances in the delivery of health services, consistent with the principle of equity which underlines our national health strategy. Illness does not respect geographical location and the organisation of our services must reflect that axiom as far as it is possible, practical and prudent to do so.  This is a central tenet of the Government's overall objective, set out in its strategy statement, of achieving regional self-sufficiency in the delivery of acute hospital services in our health board areas.  It is that objective which is driving the major capital investment in hospitals throughout the country under the present programme.  This focused programme of investment is aimed at developing strong regional hospitals, augmented by a network of effective local general hospitals, providing people with access in their own regions to the quality and range of services to which they are entitled.  The increase of 35 per cent in capital funding for the period 1998-2000, which the Government has secured, is significant in this regard.</P>
    <P>This approach to addressing regional imbalances is also evidenced in the implementation of the national cancer strategy and the strategy on cardio-vascular disease.  These two major achievements are central to the achievement of meaningful health gain by addressing the two major causes of premature death.  In developing new services under these strategies, regional imbalances in the provision of health care will be redressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a short Bill with little content and impact but it will benefit Irish people travelling or living abroad and as such I welcome it.  There is increasing mobility not just among Irish people but nationals of many states and it is practical that we should make this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> However, it is a pity that the legislation is being introduced before the White Paper.  Other Deputies have mentioned this and I ask that the Minister, in responding, be more specific on the matter.  I have no doubt he has a definite date in mind for its publication and he should assist the House by advising us of it.</P>
    <P>The Bill demonstrates why the White Paper is needed.  There is a central conflict between the Minister's roles as owner of the VHI, owner of hospitals and the regulator of health insurance, and the difficulties in that regard should be addressed.  Health insurance is an aspect of health care and cannot be dealt with as part of the market because it would be dangerous to assume that competition will provide choice and protection for people.  When the market has been opened to competition it has been governed by fundamental principles in the legislation, such as community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover and risk equalisation, and these principles must be protected for the future.</P>
    <P>VHI private health insurance cover is no longer, if it ever was, about the quality of the accommodation or a choice of menus, it is now a means to jump the queue.  Some 40 per cent of the population avail of private health insurance; they would not need it if other circumstances prevailed but it allows them quicker access to treatment and, because of the two-tier system, to better quality care.  When the White Paper is published and discussed, I hope we consider the two-tier nature of the system and, while I have seen no evidence of this so far, the Minister has a responsibility to take us beyond the system. This has been done in general practice, as you will know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; a predecessor of the current Minister showed great vision at a time when financial circumstances were not as good as they are now, and made it contrary to a doctor's contract to discriminate between public and private patients.  That is a progressive principle which must be introduced to our acute hospital service if we are to address the current inequalities.  Perhaps the State should take up insurance on behalf of public patients.  I do not know the financial implications of adopting that approach but we should look at various models with the set objective of removing inequality.</P>
    <P>I am under no illusions about the increased cost of health care.  How we will address these costs is extremely worrying and demanding of legislators and policy makers, because technological advances and medical innovations increasingly set standards and create a desire for better health care, and the nature of such advances is that they are extremely expensive.  We can see this already in the costs of certain drugs and technologies.  We must examine alternatives to the hightech options &mdash; I do not mean alternative medicine <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>Like Deputy Shatter, I am concerned about the exclusion from VHI cover of psychological services and treatments.  The Psychological Society <Col N="536" /> of Ireland has made a good case for inclusion in VHI cover, because research shows that psychological intervention can produce a lower cost or a more efficient way of treating a patient, rather than having him or her in hospital availing of expensive treatment.  We must consider interventions at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> mentioned that I was putting down a parliamentary question on this matter, and I was contacted by a constituent whose son had been seriously traumatised after being in a car accident.  He was treated for the physical injuries but the psychological damage done to him was such that he requires ongoing treatment.  Since the family cannot claim for psychological treatment although they have been advised this is the best option, and it costs £40 per session for such treatment, the likelihood is that the son's condition will deteriorate to the point where he will have to enter a psychiatric hospital for treatment.  That makes no logical sense.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to provide cover for treatment under clearly defined arrangements &mdash; there are many people who consider themselves psychologists or counsellors but do not have professional expertise or training.  It is possible for a register to be applied as the way of assessing whether a psychologist can be considered for this.  In Britain they have widened the possibilities for people availing of psychological treatment to claim on insurance &mdash; they can now go straight to a psychologist without going through a general practitioner. We should learn from what is happening in Britain and see it as an opportunity to reduce automatic access to hospitals and see if there are ways to pre-empt that access and make it unnecessary to early treatment.</P>
    <P>On another issue, I would ask that the civil servants reply, via the Minister, in clear and unequivocal language, because I have already put down a parliamentary question on it and, having read the answer, I do not have a clear idea of the Department's position on it.  It relates to where a private patient is in a public bed, not for emergency but for elective treatment.  From time to time private patients end up in public beds and are treated by a consultant.  It is clear they have to pay consultant's fees.  However, at present the VHI is paying the consultant's fees and BUPA is not, because it feels &mdash; and I suspect it has very strong grounds &mdash; that those circumstances do not entitle a private patient to use a public bed, that it is only in emergencies that a private patient can be put into a public bed.  This issue has been raised at wage agreement discussions that have been held over the years and was settled, but the practice is still occurring that private patients are occupying public beds not on an emergency basis but on an elective basis, and the VHI, through custom and practice, is paying the bills.  That is very good for the patient who has VHI, but it is very bad for the hospital service that is already in <Col N="537" /> trouble because of lack of beds.  I asked a parliamentary question and I was told:</P>
    <P>Under the health service in-patient regulations, a private patient being admitted to a public hospital as an elective admission shall not be accommodated in a designated public bed.  However, a private patient being admitted to hospital as an emergency admission shall be accommodated in a designated public bed if, and only for such time as, a designated private bed is not available.</P>
    <P>I concur with the second sentence.  Obviously an emergency case must be admitted.  However, we all know that the first condition is simply not being applied, that there are cases where private patients are coming into public beds in those circumstances and the consultants are then looking for their fees.  We need to know how the Department is dealing with that issue.  If it is the case that the practice is wrong and in contravention of the law, then we need to deal with it.  It is part of the problem of waiting lists if beds are being occupied in this way.</P>
    <P>There is another issue I would ask the Minister to consider &mdash; I do not expect him to have an immediate answer.  I raised the issue in the debate yesterday of cancer patients who were in need of urgent treatment but who were not being brought into hospital quickly enough.  In the past, people who were so badly in need of surgery would have been admitted to hospital and had surgery within a matter of days of seeing their doctor.  Some of these cancer patients, one in particular, has been waiting since July and only went into hospital in the past week.  I have subsequently discovered that in the case of two lung cancer patients a consultant was in a position to carry out surgery and the two beds were available, and he was prevented from doing so by the hospital, presumably because of budgetary considerations.  I do not know why exactly the consultant was refused the opportunity to operate.  We seem to be reaching a new low.  Is it the case that the problem is not that the consultant is not available to do the surgery or that the beds are not available but that there is another element that is blocking lung cancer patients from receiving treatment?  We are in serious trouble if this is happening, as I believe it is.</P>
    <P>There is no real point in debating the Bill in question because it is self-explanatory and we are all in agreement on it.  There is not much point either in going into issues relating to the White Paper because we have not reached that point yet, but I would ask the Minister to clarify his view on the inequalities that exist in our acute hospitals, his view on our two-tier system, on how it is operating and on how the tiers are becoming more defined rather than less defined.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we heard about the various measures the Minister intends to put in place, some of them short-term and some of them long-term in relation to hospital waiting lists. However, he did not address the kernel of the <Col N="538" /> problem.  It is extraordinary that the Minister did not once raise the issue of equality of access in his speech.  It is also extraordinary that today, when we are discussing the issue of the future of private health insurance he is again avoiding the issue of the nature of the health service and the acute hospital service in particular, because that is where the problem really lies.  We have dealt with it at general practice level.  I am sure we could do more in relation to allied services.</P>
    <P>On the acute hospital service, the kernel of the problem is that if one has money, if one can buy private health insurance, one can work one's way to the head of the queue, and if one does not have that luxury one cannot get the treatment one needs.  There are whole swathes of people in our community who are discriminated against as a result.  These are poor people, elderly people, people who are mentally handicapped.  It would be interesting to know how many people with mental handicap have VHI cover.  I would say there are very few.  They are the people who are vulnerable in our society, who do not have the freedom of choice that is a necessity if one wants to get treatment.  We have this notion that one can choose to be a private patient or not.  It is not a matter of choice.  It is a matter of necessity at the moment.  Anybody who can afford to go privately goes privately.  This in turn increasingly exacerbates the difficulties and the problems for those who cannot do that.  Those who cannot are, in the main, the people who need health care most.</P>
    <P>When it comes to sickness and ill health it is the poor who suffer most.  It starts with stillbirths. The level of stillbirths has a socio-economic basis to it.  One can look at the incidence of cardio-vascular disease.  The huge impact of social and economic factors mean that the chances of a middle aged unemployed person, a man in particular, having a heart attack are greater than somebody who is not in that category.  So those who need the hospital care most are the ones who have the least chance of accessing it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is not a new problem, although the problem is getting worse, and I appreciate that the Minister has a hard job to tackle it, but the longer he leaves it, the harder it will get.  I would remind him that the Government came into office on a very clear commitment to tackle hospital waiting lists.  Those hospital waiting lists cannot be tackled in any real or fundamental way without also tackling the basic inequality in our acute hospital services.</P>

      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1998, will enable the VHI to act as an agent for the authorised insurer in the sale of an international health care plan.  In my political innocence I always thought that the VHI did cover people who lived outside the country for a short time.  I am thinking in particular of the case of students who may have been studying in another European Union country.  In the past, the VHI allowed health insurance cover for such <Col N="539" /> students but it was only applicable for six months. Under the terms of the Bill, medical insurance could be provided for people residing outside the country for over six months and up to five years. I welcome the fact that we are now legislating for an international health care plan for people working outside the State.</P>
      <P>Private medical insurance was introduced in Ireland in 1957 following the recommendation of an advisory board which had been set up by the then Minister for Health, T. F. O'Higgins.  The advisory board investigated the feasibility of introducing a scheme of voluntary health insurance to encourage Irish people to become more self-reliant in providing for their health care needs.  The board recommended that a non-profit organisation, established especially to administer a community rated health insurance scheme, would be the best option.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Act became law on 5 February 1957 and the VHI as we know it was established.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated, the VHI was established primarily to cater for the estimated 15 to 18 per cent of the population which at the time had no entitlement to services under the public system.  In addition, the board was specifically asked to devise its insurance agreements in such a way that they would appeal to those who have public eligibility, so as to encourage self-reliance and mutual assistance on as wide a scale as possible. With its mutual ethos and a customer driven culture, the VHI has successfully met these objectives. Today its membership is at an all time high of 1.4 million members, representing 40 per cent of the population.  The VHI has been fortunate in that members who join the organisation have stayed with it down through the years.</P>
      <P>The VHI responded positively to the introduction of competition to the private medical insurance market two years ago and is operating very successfully with more than 1,000 new members joining every week.  The company operates 6,700 group schemes around the country and pays in excess of £300 million on members' health care claims each year.  I understand there are also plans for other private health care insurers to enter the market.  Obviously, such competition will be good for the consumer.</P>
      <P>In recent times the VHI has addressed the issue of new option plans but some of these plans are very expensive.  I hope the VHI will look at the quotes it is providing for option plans it is now introducing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have been unlucky in the past in not being able to get into the VHI, which was the only private health insurer until BUPA Ireland came on the market.  Six years ago a constituent of mine needed an urgent heart by-pass operation. He was quoted £12,500 for the operation at the Blackrock Clinic.  He was able to have the operation only because the local community was able to raise the money.  That is an example of how costly this type of operation is.  It brings into focus access to health care.  We have always <Col N="540" /> sought speedier access but it has been a real problem over the years, particularly in the western region.</P>
    <P>This legislation allows the VHI to offer a comprehensive range of health insurance plans to people residing in the State.  However, the expansion of the economy and greater integration with the European Union has resulted in a significant change in work practices in recent times.  Today, an increasing number of people are employed by export companies, State agencies and multinational companies and live abroad for significant periods during their working lives.  This is also the case for people working with NGOs in developing Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Up to now VHI members who spent time living abroad as part of their jobs have had to rely on the public health system in their foreign country of residence, or they have had to arrange private health care insurance overseas, but that can prove to be very expensive.  In 1994, market research among VHI members identified a demand for a product that will provide members who reside temporarily outside the State with comprehensive cover for their health care costs.  The Bill will allow the VHI to meet that demand and act as an agent for the sale of an international health care plan under which insurance cover may be provided against health care costs incurred while residing outside the State.</P>
    <P>As well as meeting specific customer demands this product will also ensure the VHI can consolidate its existing business in the corporate sector and operate effectively in a competitive environment. Given that other insurance companies can offer international plans to Irish expatriates, if VHI is precluded from providing this service, the other insurers would have a distinct competitive advantage over VHI.  When BUPA Ireland entered the Irish market it not only introduced domestic competition but also competition through BUPA International which has plans in countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The VHI-proposed international health plan would be available for Irish people who intend to live and work outside the jurisdiction for periods of, typically, more than six months and up to five years.  The main features of the product are medical insurance cover, evacuation and repatriation services and medical assistance services.  People currently insured with VHI will be able to transfer to the international plan without waiting periods or pre-existing illness restrictions, provided they have served out the normal restrictions on the domestic plans A-E and A-E options.  They will be transferred back to the domestic plans on the same terms when they return to Ireland.  The cost of health care can vary in other European Union countries and throughout the world. Obviously, the VHI will have to look at this issue.</P>
    <P>Since VHI is excluded from offering insurance outside the State, this Bill will give VHI the explicit power to act as an agent for an authorised insurer.  The Bill provides for the exercise of this power to be subject to the consent of the Minister. <Col N="541" /> It provides that the insurer, on whose behalf the VHI may act as agent, shall be authorised in accordance with the regulations governing the conduct of non-life insurance business.  It also provides for the VHI board to comply with Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989, which covers the regulation of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The proposed international health plan will not be subject to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and therefore the requirements of community rating and risk equalisation will not apply.  That is an important issue.  I favour the fact that we have community rating with the VHI.  Other medical insurance companies, such as BUPA, have always assured us they would be very interested in this point.  BUPA International is established in 170 countries worldwide, so it can transfer its members more easily from one country to another.  I understand it provides temporary cover for Irish people working abroad and that is likely to continue because it is an international company.  The cost of health insurance varies greatly from country to country and it is an issue private health insurers must examine.  There is now a great interest in private health care and, given the cost involved for those not covered by medical insurance, it is understandable that people would seek the best quotes from VHI and BUPA.</P>
    <P>An issue concerning access to health care which is of great interest to Deputies is that there has not been regional development in the provision of health care.  In the past 20 years people have had to travel to Dublin for coronary care or heart bypass operations or to Cork for eye operations. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on the welcome provision of large amounts of money for new developments in Galway University College Hospital.  Especially welcome is the provision for heart bypass operations and cancer treatment.  Cancer treatment is something I always raised when a member of the Western Health Board because I could never understand the argument that St. James' Hospital should have priority over Galway, especially as these services were not provided in the west.  We now look forward to a time when people will have access to these necessary services in their own regions.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints about private health insurance, that it has not provided for dental care or orthodontic treatment, which can be very expensive if a person attends a private practitioner.  The question arises whether we should try to have the insurers cover the area or whether we should provide more funding for private dentists to take over some orthodontic treatment and dental care.  It has proved very difficult for the Western Health Board to find suitable people to work in the area.  The tendency is for people to go to the private sector as orthodontists or highly qualified dental technicians.  The VHI should examine this area.  It should also examine complaints from mothers, especially first-time mothers, that they receive so little cover <Col N="542" /> for their hospital stay and that they must leave early.  This is a subject of discussion between the VHI and major hospitals.</P>
    <P>There have been calls in the debate for a strategic partner for the VHI.  I would like to hear the Minister's response on that and he might refer to it when the White Paper is being discussed.  I would like to see a discussion on a White Paper on the entire health area because one aspect cannot be isolated from the other.  The White Paper on private health insurance should examine the entire health area.</P>
    <P>There is a need for other private insurers to enter the market and, no doubt, this will happen in the context of the European Union.  I hope that, regardless of who enters the market, the community rating will be maintained.  VHI and BUPA have said they are open to all subscribers and VHI is fortunate that those who started with them have stayed with them by and large.  There is the suggestion that some of the new insurers will cherry pick the system and accept only young and fit people.  It must never be forgotten that services are badly needed for the elderly.  As more elderly people live longer, it must be ensured that services are available for them.  I hope the private insurers remember that and will not cherry pick the system so that they do not have to pay out large health care claims.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope there will be other opportunities to discuss the operations of insurers such as the VHI.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a technical but important amendment to existing legislation governing the operations of the VHI.  It brings home to us that we are living in a global village and that, fortunately, many Irish people now have opportunities to voluntarily work abroad.  It is important that, in doing that, they have adequate health insurance.  Like other speakers, I was under the impression that such a facility was provided by the VHI.  The legislation clarifies the position and ensures that those people who travel abroad will have adequate health cover.  That is welcome.</P>
      <P>There is a corollary to that service offered by the VHI to people who go abroad.  It is the duty of care which exists for the VHI and others who operate in the domestic health insurance market to cover returned emigrants who may have had health insurance all their lives and find that, when they return home, they do not have any health insurance here and that no company is willing to cover them.  I have had occasion recently to make representations to the VHI about a returned emigrant who, for all the years he worked abroad, had health insurance.  The VHI, because of the age of the applicant, refused to provide any cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> That is most unacceptable.  It appears to me to fly in the face of community rating, although the VHI disputes that.</P>
    <P>In the motor insurance industry, if one changes insurance companies with a full no-claims bonus, one is entitled to a quotation from another company. However, it does not operate in that way in the health insurance industry and there is a loading because of age.  If people have lived in another country and have had health cover for all their lives, there should be an onus on providers of health insurance to continue that cover.</P>
    <P>The emigrant returned from America had health insurance all his life with a company called Blue Cross Blue Shield.  To the best of my knowledge, the VHI had a reciprocal arrangement with that company for many years but it was recently terminated.  I accept that I am highlighting an individual case but, because of the lure of the Celtic tiger and emigrants' desire to return home, there will be an increasing flow of people into the country who paid health insurance abroad.  It would fly in the face of the principle of community rating &mdash; which underpins the operation of health insurance operators in Ireland &mdash; if they found themselves at a disadvantage.  It would also appear to be a corollary of the provision in the Bill which enables the VHI to provide cover for people travelling abroad.  The VHI should be obliged to provide cover for people returning to Ireland who paid health insurance abroad.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on this issue, which will begin to arise on a more frequent basis because of the numbers of people who emigrated in the 1980s &mdash; when 40,000 to 50,000 people left Ireland each year &mdash; returning home and who have discovered that economic opportunities await them here.  Health insurance is an important consideration, particularly for people with families.  It appears that the Bill envisages the reciprocal type of arrangement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which deals with a minor change which ensures competitors do not have an unfair advantage over the VHI rather than providing the company with any particular advantages. However, there are a number of other issues in the health insurance area in respect of which many people are awaiting a meaningful response from the Government.  It is interesting that approximately 40 per cent of the population are covered by the VHI.  I am not familiar with the number of people insured by BUPA but I am sure that number is growing.  That is an indication of the importance people attach to health insurance.  It is also an indication of widespread dissatisfaction with the standard of the existing public health service.  The VHI has become a vehicle, through private health care, for people of means to jump queues and ensure they receive hospital treatment earlier than those who do not have health insurance cover.</P>
    <P>It appears that VHI premiums are increasing if not on a quarterly basis then certainly twice a year.  The issue of medical inflation is at risk of <Col N="544" /> putting the cost of voluntary health insurance &mdash; with the VHI, BUPA or another company &mdash; beyond the reach of many people on average incomes.  There are difficult times ahead for the Department and the Minister in terms of grappling with this issue.  I do not know what is responsible for fuelling medical inflation but advances in technology and the demand that all forms of treatment should be available to everyone are obviously two of the factors involved.</P>
    <P>I have an unfounded view &mdash; I cannot substantiate it in detail &mdash; that there are certain vested interests in the health service which are making a considerable killing at the expense of people who are unable to afford private health insurance.  The interests of consultants are catered for by a constituent of mine &mdash; he is also a close personal friend &mdash; Finbar Fitzpatrick who, I have no doubt, does an excellent job on their behalf.  Will the Minister assess the current contracts under which consultants operate which enable them to mix public and private practice?  As previous speakers stated, on occasion, private patients are being admitted to public beds for elective procedures. As a member of the health board I am aware that this happens on a nudge and wink basis and consultants are making a killing at the expense of public patients.</P>

      <P>That is the Minister of State's responsibility but I will give him every possible assistance.</P>
      <P>Figures to which Members referred during Private Members' Business this week indicate that in excess of 30,000 people are on hospital waiting lists.  The type of behaviour which involves consultants and hospital authorities putting private patients in public beds happens at the expense of public patients and it is adding to the length of the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Kitt referred to orthodontic treatment.  This area is causing enormous anxiety to parents and teenage children, who are particularly conscious of their appearance and who require orthodontic treatment as a matter of urgency.  Will the Minister investigate why the cost of orthodontic treatment in Northern Ireland is only a fraction of the cost which obtains in the Republic?  I understand that orthodontic treatment in Northern Ireland costs 50 per cent less than in the Republic.  I will stand corrected if the Minister informs me otherwise.  I am aware of people who have availed of treatment in Northern Ireland because they could not afford to do so here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is the case with psychology services, why is the cost of orthodontic treatment not covered by the VHI?  From my experience, the Southern Health Board encountered enormous difficulties in encouraging people to work in the public <Col N="545" /> orthodontic service because of the amount of money they could earn in private practice.  Will the Minister review the guidelines governing eligibility for orthodontic treatment?  Those guidelines are extremely restrictive and people are suffering considerably because they cannot afford to seek private treatment or they do not qualify under the guidelines.  Even if they do qualify, the waiting lists for treatment are very long.  Many people suffer considerable emotional trauma during their teenage years, they are taunted and bullied by their peers and they refuse to go out because they are conscious of their appearance.  At our age that may appear to be a cosmetic issue but for teenagers it is extremely important.</P>
    <P>One of the other areas responsible for fuelling medical inflation involves drug companies, the cost of prescribing drugs and the demand for new drugs.  Nothing brings this home more than the recent phenomenon involving the wonder drug, Viagra.  I spoke to a pharmacist recently who informed me that in the region of £1,000 worth of Viagra was being sold each week on prescription by their shop which shows the enormous capacity of new drugs to fuel medical inflation.  When Viagra becomes available in due course on the GMS &mdash; I have no doubt it will become available &mdash; medical inflation will be fuelled further.  The relationship between GPs and drug companies is worthy of closer investigation.  The demand that the latest wonder drug should be prescribed in cases where generic drugs could be equally effective must also be investigated.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that the health service, public and private, has in its employ people of great ability who do wonders for the patients they treat. However, there are inequities in the service and people who cannot afford to pay for treatment are being by-passed by those on voluntary health insurance.  Problems are also being fuelled by a minority of those employed in the medical profession. These matters must be investigated because, if they are not, the premiums charged by VHI and other companies will continue to escalate. While at present 40 per cent of the population are covered by the VHI &mdash; over 50 per cent of people are covered when BUPA subscribers are taken into consideration &mdash; this figure will diminish significantly if the rise in the cost of premiums continues.  That will have horrendous consequences in terms of increasing the numbers on waiting lists which are already excessively long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Creed for sharing time.  I welcome the Bill.  My principal point &mdash; I want the Minister to examine it &mdash; involves an anomaly between voluntary health insurance in the Republic and that in Northern Ireland.  I was a strong supporter of the VHI and have recommended down through the years that people have voluntary health insurance because of the overall cost of medical care, which has not decreased in recent years.  The cost of medical care is now beyond the reach of most families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> Deputies Kitt and Creed referred to orthodontic treatment.  I emphasise the astronomical cost of this corrective procedure which is necessary for young people.  It is practically impossible to have the corrective procedures carried out in the period when correction can take place in the growing years, because of the long waiting lists.  Parents are forced then to take it up with a private practitioner where one is talking of bills in excess of £1,000.  Deputy Creed said it was much cheaper in Northern Ireland.  It may not be that much cheaper but it is certainly readily available at a cost.</P>
    <P>With regard to the VHI, I am delighted that BUPA Ireland has entered the marketplace and challenged the VHI.  I have lost confidence in the VHI's standards.  It is a company which reads the fine print.  It is concerned with where it cannot and will not pay.  I formed that view as a result of the experience of a good friend of mine who had reason to visit his doctor with an ailment which had troubled him for 20 or 30 years.  It was something he needed to have addressed having lived with it for a long time.  His GP recommended that he attend Cavan General Hospital where he spoke to a doctor who, on examining him, said a successful operation could be carried out.  The doctor recommended two specialists in the field, one based in Dublin and the other attached to Cavan General Hospital.  Needless to say, being from Cavan he took the advice of the specialist attached to that hospital who, the doctor assured him, would deal successfully with his problem. The specialist advised the patient to come to his surgery at Tyrone General Hospital in Omagh. The preliminary examinations, blood tests and so on were carried out at Cavan General Hospital and the patient then travelled to Omagh.  The operation was carried out by this eminent man and I am delighted to say 12 months later that it was an outstanding success.  A niggling ongoing problem of the previous 20 or 30 years was gone and the man had a whole new lease of life.  The patient, who was a fully paid up member of the VHI, sent his bills to the VHI and that reputable insurance body refused to pay because the operation was carried out outside the State.</P>
    <P>The patient came to me as a constituent and I took up the issue with the VHI but I was simply up against a stone wall; the company refused to pay.  It advised me, strangely enough, that if the patient had been outside the country and had been in Northern Ireland on business and had fallen ill, the company would cover him. However, because the specialist attached to the North-Eastern Health Board and Cavan General Hospital invited the patient to come to his surgery at Omagh for the operation, the company refused to pay.  I do not accept that; I could not accept it.  I have tried and failed, but I have not let go yet and I am advising the House of this disgraceful carry on.</P>
    <P>It has now come to my notice from the publicity which I received on local radio in raising this matter that another patient of Cavan General</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> Hospital had the same experience.  This person was recommended by another specialist attached to Cavan General Hospital who also works at the marvellous Tyrone General Hospital in Omagh to go there for the necessary procedure, but the VHI will not pay.  That is not acceptable and it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I will go further.  In the case of patient A all of the procedures leading up to the operation were carried out at Cavan General Hospital.  The person in question, being a busy man and not having time to stay overnight, went in on a daily basis for these tests and because he was not an in-patient but was considered an out-patient for the tests the VHI would not pay these costs either.  Had the patient gone into hospital the night before or a week before and stayed longer at a greater cost to the VHI, the company would have paid for all of the costs incurred as an in-patient.  If there ever was a stupid regulation, that is one.  It is totally unacceptable, that the more costs one incurs the more proportionately the company will pay and the less costs one incurs the less the company will pay.  That patient did not stay overnight preceding the operation but travelled to Omagh in the morning because the hospital is conveniently only about 30 miles from his home.  The distance to Dublin to the other specialist who was recommended was more than 90 miles.  Needless to say, the patient took the convenient option which was recommended and which involved working within the North-Eastern Health Board area and the VHI refused to pay.  That is not acceptable.  If the Minister wants the details of the people concerned, I will be glad to give them to him.  Even though that was 12 months ago, the patient has paid his bills because he is not the type of person who would live with that.</P>
    <P>I have certainly had second thoughts about the VHI.  Unless the company comes up front on this one, I certainly recommend that people shop around for an insurer.  I am delighted that BUPA Ireland has entered the marketplace and offered competition.  The VHI obviously thought it could treat people in its own way and not in the best interest of the patient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed legislation will allow new schemes to be offered for sale to Irish customers which will allow complete health cover throughout the world.  The present VHI scheme is excellent and the facilities are superb, but anybody who has an accident while on holidays or working in a foreign country is faced with the problem of meeting massive health care costs.  This is particularly the case in America where medical care is very expensive.  We are all familiar with people who have had accidents in another country and the high cost of treatment is left to the family of the victim.  We are fortunate that Irish people are very generous and all calls for financial assistance for such causes are well supported.  This Bill will see an end to this arrangement and Irish people can travel with confidence <Col N="548" /> throughout the world secure in the knowledge that their health care needs will be covered.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1957, the VHI has provided cover on a non-profit basis.  It had a massive customer base and offered a varied health cover plans to suit every individual. Option plans have been introduced recently to cater for the enhanced cover requirements of customers and this new facility of an international cover plan will further enhance the service and improve the product it offers.</P>
      <P>Recent EU directives have opened the market to competition and we are fortunate to have a company with a solid reputation and good marketing record now operating in Ireland.  The VHI's statutory monopoly has ended and the market is open to competition.  This will ensure that all players remain competitive while constantly striving to improve their products and services. These two health insurance companies operating in Ireland offer affordable prices, open enrolment, life cover and community rating.</P>
      <P>We have had an excellent health care facility in Ireland coupled with highly competent research centres in our hospitals, laboratories and universities. We must continue to invest in health care for all sectors of society.</P>
      <P>We have recently opened a major new hospital at Tallaght offering state of the art facilities.  In my constituency we have seen additional investment in Mallow General Hospital and St. Patrick's Hospital, Kanturk.  To maintain a good health care service it is imperative that we continue to invest in local health care.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that early detection of serious illness improves the chances of survival.  We must maintain local facilities if we are to continue with the current trend of preventative medicine.  This is particularly applicable to rural Ireland where people, especially the aged, may have difficulty arranging travel to medical centres in the absence of adequate public transport.</P>
      <P>Local hospitals cater for people in their own environment and facilitate the visits of family and friends, which helps the recovery process.  We must ensure such services are always provided and that we continue the current strategy of providing local health care.  This is especially the case with Cork University Hospital, which has a very good cancer treatment unit.  When patients are faced with the detection of cancer they and their families often have fears and concerns.  It is not always practicable for people to travel long distances to avail of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. We must ensure they are available at least to a reasonable extent within local areas.  While the services provided by Cork University Hospital are second to none, the Minister, the Department and public representatives must ensure that patient after care is top class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospice movement, respite care and the care of the terminally ill is very good.  The hospice movement provides an excellent service throughout the country, but more investment is needed. We should encourage this service as much as <Col N="549" /> possible.  I have visited a number of hospices and have seen the dedication of the staff and the nurses.  It is a rewarding experience to observe the support and help they extend to patients and their capacity to put them in good form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hitherto, the VHI has offered services to those who are least likely to incur illness.  It does not cater adequately for the elderly.  There is little point in excluding cover for ten years for an illness &mdash; even for a minor illness &mdash; an elderly applicant may have suffered.  If, for example, a 55 year old applicant suffered a minor heart complaint a couple of years earlier, he or she would be 65 years of age before the VHI would provide cover for any related illnesses. Increased competition should ease this problem. In addition, the VHI needs to provide cover for a number of treatments it currently excludes, such as dental care and orthodontic treatment.</P>
      <P>People with VHI cover or other forms of health insurance who work and live abroad have had great difficulty in getting adequate protection.  Many have had to pay huge bills which their families have often had to meet.  In some cases, this has necessitated fundraising events to facilitate their return to Ireland or to ensure they received health care abroad.  This is unacceptable.  If a VHI subscriber is not satisfied with the way he or she is treated by a consultant, who may not have a good bedside manner, that consultant can submit a claim for whatever fee he or she so wishes without consulting the patient.  The patient can write to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, but how can he or she protest about the way he or she was treated by a particular consultant?  That matter should be examined.  That issue was raised by a constituent last weekend who told me he was charged more than £300 by a consultant who saw him while he was in hospital for five minutes and he was not treated with the respect he deserved. However the majority of consultants provide an excellent service and they cannot all be tarred with the one brush because of the treatment of one consultant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Voluntary Health Insurance Board. The Bill introduced by the Minister is worthwhile. It provides that Irish nationals working abroad for a period will have access to the medical insurance they require.  The Bill provides an opportunity to examine the VHI and to remind the Minister that some other provisions should have been included in it, which would have improved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI was set up in the 1950s and was a welcome development.  As a young person, I <Col N="550" /> recall the discussions that took place in our house as to whether we should join it.  I do not believe that my father, who used to put things on the long finger, joined it, much to the disgust of my mother.  The late Paddy Shaw, who lived in my area, was one of the first directors of the VHI. Due to the foresight of people like him, the VHI has developed to the stage it is now at.</P>
    <P>The VHI has grown over the past few years and it now has 1.4 million customers in Ireland. Subscriptions bring in £300 million per year.  That represents tremendous growth and the number of subscribers have gradually increased over a number of years.  It is interesting to note that a health care company, Oxford Health Plans, located in Mullingar recently and many of its claims are processed there.  I was told by one of the executives that the company has a membership of 1.4 million in the United States and it has a multi-billion dollar turnover annually.  Health insurance in the United States is multiples of what it constitutes here and it costs a great deal more.  That company has 6,000 staff dealing with its 1.4 million customers, which is very different from the VHI's streamline operation.  We should commend the VHI for the small amount it spends on administration on behalf of its customers.</P>
    <P>Hospitals now submit claims directly to the VHI for payment on behalf of subscribers, a worthwhile and recent development.  I recall on one occasion a number of years ago a doctor told me that he had treated a VHI subscriber and looked after him very well and he sent his bill to the subscriber who in turn submitted it to the VHI.  In the past the VHI sent the cheque in full payment to the subscriber who subsequently reimbursed the doctor but that subscriber failed to reimburse the doctor, and was able to enhance his bank balance considerably as a result of good treatment by the doctor who was left to whistle for his money.  The streamlining of the payment of bills has been a great help and there is also a clawback provision in respect of tax relief.</P>
    <P>The VHI is a non-profit making organisation and some of the interest groups who gain from it sometimes tend to forget that.  Its 1.4 million subscribers pay their subscriptions and that fund is distributed to the various interest groups, hospitals and doctors, and a small amount is used to cover administration costs.  Those interest groups compete annually for a share of the £300 million fund.  If the VHI is not the first arm, it is the third arm of the Department of Health and Children.  It subscribes substantially to the public health service by way of covering the cost of subscribers when they are hospitalised in public hospitals.  However, the major proportion of its expenditure goes to private hospitals, many of which are dependent on its funding and the doctors get a substantial amount of its fund. Those competing interest groups vie to increase their charges and are anxious that their fees are increased annually.  The main impact of that is the subscriber has to pay an increased subscription. We have seen a hike in the level of the subscription <Col N="551" /> year after year.  This matter should be examined.</P>
    <P>In that regard I propose that an ombudsman should be appointed to deal specifically with problems related to the VHI, or the remit of the Ombudsman should be expanded to include disputes concerning the VHI.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, might put that suggestion to the Minister.  The acting chairman will be aware that subscribers who have a dispute with the VHI over the payment of a bill or other matters have no means of redress.  The VHI is the judge and jury on any disputed claim.  I have had recourse to contact it over the years on various matters and it tends to reconsider the matter, but inevitably it responds to the effect that having reviewed the position it finds there is no valid claim.  That is regrettable because many subscribers have been annoyed about the way their claims were dealt with by the VHI and it is unfair that they do not have some means of redress.</P>
    <P>The remit of such an ombudsman should extend beyond dealing with disputes.  It should cover the competing request for funds by hospitals and doctors.  Such an ombudsman could deal with requests for increased fee payments. The doctor or the hospital concerned could refer the request to such an ombudsman who would have competency to examine it and, if necessary, negotiate between the bodies.  That would provide a facility for discussion and negotiation which would ensure the subscriber would not be ripped off on all occasions.  Such a role is important and it is remiss of the Minister not to provide for it on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The acting chairman will recall that in its recent report on the VHI the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies recommended the appointment of such an ombudsman.  The recommendation may have been made before the acting chairman was a member of the joint committee. The joint committee was strongly of the view that an ombudsman should be appointed to deal with such disputes.  The Minister would be well advised to accept that recommendation.</P>
    <P>A particular dispute at that time gave rise to many problems and highlighted the need for the appointment of such an ombudsman.  That dispute arose between a hospital in my area, St. Francis medical centre, and the VHI, and it turned out to be very bitter.  It subsequently ended up in the Supreme Court.  I regret the Minister of the day, either because of negligence or active hostility, did not facilitate efforts to resolve what turned out to be a major dispute. Initially cover for the hospital was withdrawn, the case went to court and was appealed to the High Court and in turn to the Supreme Court.  The net result was a cost to the subscriber which amounted to millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>When we consider the VHI's annual turnover, there has been a hike of 2 to 3 per cent in members' subscriptions over a period of time. The VHI should not have taken that matter that <Col N="552" /> far.  I was annoyed by that because I spent a good deal of time trying to resolve the dispute and put forward various proposals.  I was aware that I did not have the capability to resolve it, but I put forward proposals for a mechanism that could help resolve it.  On that occasion the hospital was prepared to accept those proposals for mediation, but the VHI turned them down.  I recall that a meeting I set up with a VHI executive and a representative of the hospital to try to work out a mechanism to resolve the dispute was cancelled on the morning it was due to take place.</P>
    <P>I have an opinion on who intervened to cancel that meeting.  Hopefully with the Freedom of Information Act now in place, I will get to the bottom of that matter, which was disappointing. The ordinary VHI subscriber had to pick up the tab for the £5 million or £6 million, not to mention the difficulties which ensued for others involved.  The hospital employees were put on short time because there were not enough patients.  Some doctors, nurses, domestic and administration staff lost their jobs and some were put on short time.  A great number of them lost money.  This was unfair and could have been resolved.  I hope the Minister of State will refer this to the Minister and Departmental officials. There is a great need for an ombudsman to review disputes between the various bodies.  One could have a specific VHI ombudsman or the remit of the existing Ombudsman could be broadened.</P>
    <P>The other issue as regards the VHI is the competition which has now appeared on the home front, especially in terms of the plans available. The Minister said new members are joining the VHI at the rate of 1,000 per week.  It will be interesting to see how its competitor has fared.  I am sure it would say new members are joining at the rate of 1,100 per week &mdash; it would certainly have to outdo the VHI.  This area is increasing in importance and it must be looked at carefully.</P>
    <P>The introduction of competition was worthwhile. The committee strongly recommended that the market be opened up for the benefit of the subscriber.  As public representatives, we should bat on behalf of the consumer.  If VHI is to survive, continue and stave off competition, it must expand within the terms of this Bill and appoint an ombudsman to deal with disputes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this useful and important Bill giving new options to the VHI which will hopefully tackle some of the problems in the health service.  The VHI will act as an agent for the sale of an international healthcare plan which will provide against healthcare costs incurred for those residing temporarily outside the State.  This is important for young people, especially students, who leave the State to work during the summer or study for a year.  Many students have scary stories to tell about getting injured or ill outside the State and having no insurance cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision also applies to the elderly.  I <Col N="553" /> recall a case where a woman went to the United States and broke her hip while there and she had to pay for a hip replacement.  I know of a 28 year old man who went to Canada on holiday for three weeks and had a heart attack.  He had no health insurance cover and came back after three weeks for treatment.  It is unacceptable that a person has a heart attack in the first week of his holiday, receives no medical assistance for the following two weeks because he is not covered and has to come back here to be treated.  It should not happen and hopefully with the introduction of this Bill some of these problems will be alleviated.</P>
    <P>I am wary about private insurance companies coming into this country with the deregulation of the market, cherrypicking young and middle-aged people and turning away the elderly or those with chronic conditions.  This type of discrimination has existed in the motor insurance industry for years.  Young people cannot get insurance because of the huge cost.  The same will happen in the health insurance industry unless we ensure the provision of a community rating.  This is a huge benefit in encouraging the elderly to take up health insurance and it must be complimented. One criticism I have of the voluntary health sector is that only about 40 per cent of the population are in the VHI or BUPA.  We must look closely at encouraging more people to take up voluntary health insurance, perhaps by subsidy.</P>
    <P>Private patients are given priority medical treatment.  In the past couple of days, an increase of 26 per cent in the public waiting list was announced.  Part of the problem is due to private patients taking up public sector beds.  This is leading to increased waiting lists and some people must wait up to two years for treatment.  There is a 20 per cent chance that someone waiting for a heart by-pass will die if they are on a public waiting list.  What do hospitals do?  They prioritise private patients and put them ahead of public patients who may have been waiting six, 12 or 18 months for a procedure to be carried out.  Someone with VHI cover gets precedence and the public patient is told to go home and ring the hospital the following week to see if it has a place.</P>
    <P>Hospitals charge private rates for a private patient in a public bed.  This should not be the case.  It is causing an increase in the charges the VHI is paying to hospitals and thus the charge on those who take out voluntary health insurance. Subsequently, it is a disincentive for those on public waiting lists who do not have VHI cover to take it up as the cost becomes more prohibitive. We must look at the comparison between private and public waiting lists.  One will benefit the other.</P>
    <P>Many hospitals in the country have private beds.  Roscommon County Hospital has very few in the general and psychiatric services.  It is trying to put more private beds into the psychiatric unit as the health board receives more money for private patients.  A great deal can be done by targeting resources at district hospitals.  They can provide private beds but should also introduce <Col N="554" /> additional procedures for public patients.  People with VHI cover should be encouraged to have procedures carried out in smaller hospitals.  This will decrease waiting lists in public hospitals, like the two regional hospitals in the Minister's constituency &mdash; University College Hospital and Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  The Minister should seriously consider my suggestion that extra resources be channelled to smaller hospitals as a means of tackling waiting lists which have increased by 26 per cent in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The VHI does not provide cover for orthodontic treatment.  There are 3,589 young people on the waiting list in the Western Health Board region where routine procedures are rarely performed. Young people are assessed prior to entering secondary school and on reaching the age of 18 are informed they are no longer eligible. Some have been waiting between ten and 12 years for treatment.  The sooner it is provided &mdash; preferably at regional centres &mdash; the greater the chance of it being successful.  Again, some of the procedures could be performed in smaller hospitals.  It is only the worst cases that receive attention.  This is causing serious problems, including depression, in an era where young people are so conscious of their appearance. When will the report of the review group be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that if the VHI was to provide cover for orthodontic treatment the numbers on public waiting lists would reduce.  The review group should consider my suggestion seriously.</P>
      <P>More people should be encouraged to take out voluntary health insurance.  Only 40 per cent of the population are covered by such schemes.  The medical card system is a joke.  The income limit for a married couple is £129 per week.  Many lowincome families do not qualify as a result.  The income limit for family income supplement is £230.  The guidelines should be reviewed.</P>
      <P>The cost of providing cover for students attending college is prohibitive.  An effort should be made to have more people included because the service provided by general practitioners in colleges is atrocious.  If young people were covered by the VHI, they could choose their own general practitioner.  They have to wait up to three weeks to see a general practitioner in college. Every student should be entitled to a medical card.</P>
      <P>The elderly should also be encouraged to take out voluntary health insurance from the VHI or BUPA to alleviate some of the problems being experienced in the public sector.  The principle of community rating should continue to be the cornerstone of the market.  Every elderly person should be entitled to a medical card regardless of income.  They should not be means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> The VHI and BUPA do not provide funding to finance health promotion campaigns, a number of which have been conducted by health boards in connection with drug awareness and suicide.  We should combat these problems before people end up in hospital when they will become a cost to these companies.  There is need for greater co-ordination of the activities of county councils, voluntary youth organisations and the voluntary health insurance sector to tackle these issues.  We have very serious problems.  I recently read that the UK Green Party are promoting drugs awareness. It recommends a chemical test of the purity of ecstasy tablets.  While I do not agree with such an idea, it represents a new and radical approach to the problem of drug abuse.  All the bodies involved, including the health boards and the VHI must re-examine our methods of tackling this problem.  Garda seizures will not solve it. Education and the promotion of health awareness are needed to deal with the demand side of the problem.  The voluntary health sector has failed in this area.  We should look at the health information campaigns which have been put in place in Britain.  We hear of radio stations offering help lines which make young people aware of the risks involved in taking drugs and we return inevitably to the question of funding.  The voluntary health sector must be encouraged to participate in funding health promotion.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health and Children and the voluntary health organisations have failed to promote men's health while the issue of women's health has been prominent for many years.  The question of suicide must be addressed as a health issue.  The voluntary health insurance sector has failed in its role to promote health awareness which is a vital aspect of any health service.  The problem of waiting lists can be alleviated by a health awareness programme which will keep people out of hospitals in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Minister must examine these issues and hold discussions with the voluntary health insurance sector on the question of health promotion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the services provided by the VHI is to be welcomed because we live in a rapidly changing world.  We have greater mobility and it is not unusual for people to go abroad for short periods.  It is important, therefore, that the VHI has the power to provide a temporary service for people when they are abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the VHI on the role it has played in our health system since its establishment, I hate to think what would have happened without it.  The company was an integral part of our health system at a time when the resources of the State were less than they are today.  However, there is now a real threat to that service.  The VHI has traditionally provided health care cover for the duration of a person's illness, whether that was for 12 months or five years.  The trend now is to <Col N="556" /> offer units of money as insurance cover.  This practice will be detrimental to the health of the population if it is allowed to continue.  This new practice means that when a customer's units are exhausted he or she will no longer have cover. What will happen to the health of the patient in such circumstances?  This problem is particularly acute in psychiatric medicine.  In the United States people who need long-term care are often discharged from psychiatric hospitals and given only a supply of drugs because their units of cover are coming to an end.  The health service is not being provided in the interest of the patient, it is simply based on the amount of cover provided by his or her insurance scheme.  It would be detrimental to the health of our citizens to allow such a system to develop here.  In our desire to be competitive and to offer choice to consumers we must remember that voluntary health insurance is an integral part of our health system.</P>
    <P>If this trend is allowed to continue we may reach a stage where a public patient receives better treatment than one covered by an insurance scheme because a public patient with a long-term illness will be treated until he or she is cured while an insured private patient will be treated only until cover runs out.  This is a real danger which could arise from increased competition in health insurance.</P>
    <P>Health insurance companies should be obliged to provide members with insurance cover while they are temporarily abroad equivalent to what they would receive here.  Companies must not revert to a system of units of cover and members who are temporarily abroad must not be caught in a situation similar to that which I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>In his public utterances on health insurance, the Minister must make the public aware of the difference between the various types of cover on offer.  I want to be sure that if I pay my premium and then become ill, I will be covered for as long as it takes to cure my illness.  I would not want to have to leave hospital because my cover expired and wait until I had built up sufficient units of cover before returning for treatment.  Such a situation would be detrimental to our health service.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of powers the Bill gives to voluntary health insurance companies, but I am fearful of possible changes which could take place in health insurance cover.  I hope such a system will never operate in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who participated in the debate.  While the intent and purpose of the Bill is specific, it has given Deputies an opportunity to raise many pertinent issues that will be addressed in the context of the White Paper due to be published towards the end of the year. Deputies articulated issues of concern to them in terms of the service being provided and the type of schemes on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a recognition that private health insurance has been an important factor in the <Col N="557" /> funding of the provision of health services in Ireland.  A growing number of people are taking out private health insurance, with a high proportion of the population, in percentage terms, now covered.  Successive Governments have not sought to dictate the level of coverage.  Traditionally, private health insurance has been taken out on a voluntary basis by members of the public.</P>
    <P>The success of private health insurance derives from the fact that we have a community rated market.  If it were risk rated, older people and the chronically sick would have to pay much higher premium levels.  The numbers taking out private health insurance are also a reflection of the strength of our economy and we have seen private health insurance emerge in significance as an employee benefit.  Health insurance also attracts tax relief.</P>
    <P>My fundamental responsibility is to ensure that the interests of both the public and private patient are protected; the public patient in terms of ensuring universal access to public hospital services, and the private patient in relation to ensuring that the fundamental elements of our private health insurance system are maintained.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with some specific points raised in the debate.  Deputy Shatter raised the issue of insurance contracts.  I accept that it is essential consumers should have details of health insurance contracts expressed in clear language. Considerable improvements have been made in this regard but there may be a further need for improvement, and I will consider the point the Deputy raised in relation to the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter also raised the issue of psychological cover.  He and other Deputies made the point that there is scope for improvement in relation to additional professional services to be covered as part of health insurance contracts. Indeed, this may be an area where there is scope for competition between insurers.</P>
    <P>The current system of designation of public and private beds, an issue raised by many Deputies, dates back to 1991.  It is in the interests of hospital management to have private patients treated in designated private beds.  The position regarding beds used in emergency cases is as I already explained to Deputy McManus.  Patients treated as private patients are liable for consultants' fees and private patients who are accommodated in public beds are not liable for accommodation charges.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputies Kitt and Creed, VHI currently operates what is known as VHI Assist which provides cover for people going abroad for holidays and other temporary periods.  However, as market research and ongoing requests clearly indicate, VHI considers it essential that it be empowered to offer comprehensive cover in this regard, particularly for those travelling abroad for longer periods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall queried the important role played by consultants in the control of the health services and the need for them to be part of a management process in hospitals.  In relation to <Col N="558" /> clinicians and management generally, the challenge in meeting patient needs demonstrates the need for teamwork in our hospitals.  We know the provision of the bulk of hospital services requires teamwork in the wards, operating theatres and outpatient departments.  Effective teamwork is based on respect for each member's role and on methods of working which integrate the contribution of each team member.  We need to elevate this approach to the corporate level in all our hospitals.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work has been undertaken on this front in the past decade and since the introduction in 1991 of consultants' contracts, many consultants have been to the fore in participating in pilot studies on clinicians in management.  I am pleased to say those early pioneers at St. James's Hospital as well as those in Cork, Wexford and the north west have now been joined by several other centres.  The current contract is built on this experience and provides the framework and opportunity for a collaborative approach to managing our hospitals to be introduced nationwide. The recently published Report on the Commission on Nursing made a series of recommendations which will also give momentum to this process.</P>
    <P>There will be difficulties ahead but all those who participated in the pilot studies seem to agree that they would not wish to go back to the old ways.  That sentiment has to be the inspiration for those who have not yet embarked on this course of change.  I dwelt on this issue at some length when I spoke at the Irish Hospital Consultants Association dinner in Galway last Saturday night.</P>
    <P>There are successful examples of clinical directorates where the more modern idiom of management process is in place.  There is no question that with the impact of technology and the range of new procedures coming onstream in the delivery of health care, we need clinicians to recognise the concerns of managers in terms of budgetary limits. At the same time, management must also be aware of clinicians' aspirations to provide best practice at any given time.</P>
    <P>Clearly people must speak a common language in terms of providing the best possible cost effective service in a hospital setting.  That can only be done where there are structured arrangements such as clinical directorates and liaison with management, specialist and clinician, so that the effective running of the hospital is not compromised by people going in opposite directions in their operational responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall raised some issues in relation to the consultants' common contract.  The current contract on offer to hospital consultants is effective from 1 January this year and was agreed following lengthy negotiations with the medical organisations concerned.  Under the terms of the contract, hospital consultants sign an individual contract with hospitals or health boards and agree how the commitment is to be discharged having <Col N="559" /> regard to the nature of the service to be provided to the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>Hospital consultants are engaged to provide at least 11 three-hour sessions in the public hospital service each week and are also required to be on call outside normal working hours to deal with emergencies as appropriate.  Consultants are paid a basic salary together with additional payments for being on call and also for being called out to deal with emergency cases.</P>
    <P>The contract includes a grievance procedure in the event of non-compliance by either party with the terms.  In addition, the employer can also invoke the disciplinary procedure where necessary. Under the terms of the existing contract, consultants are enabled to engage in the treatment of both private and public patients.  Private patients may be treated in public hospitals or in private consulting rooms.  The contract offered takes into account the consultants' commitment to the public hospital system and is remunerated accordingly.</P>
    <P>Other speakers raised the issue of the economic cost of private beds in public hospitals and whether there was a subsidisation element involved.  They suggested, for example, that the role of the Minister in authorising any premium increases sought by the VHI board on the one hand and the question of increasing the price of private beds in public hospitals on the other amounted to a conflicting interest on the part of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We intend to deal in the White Paper with the supervisory role of the Minister in the context of private health insurance and in relation to new corporate structures for VHI, which are currently the subject of intensive discussion by the parties concerned.  We recognise the need to deal with the question of supervision and regulatory functions. There is perhaps a more direct involvement by the Minister in dealing with the strategic direction of the private health insurance markets.</P>
    <P>On the question of economic costing, the Department has estimated that on the basis of information available to it in relation to claims made to health insurance companies, an increase of 9 per cent in the private and semi-private bed charges in public hospitals, such as the increase made at the time of the 1997 budget, would add approximately 2 per cent to the annual cost of claims.  There can be no suggestion that seeking increases in the cost of private and semi-private beds was solely responsible for the level of increase in premium charges.  That emanates later in the year, usually in June or July, and comes into effect in September.  That is often put forward as the exclusive reason for increased premium charges, but it is not correct.  We estimate that the 1997 changes would have been responsible for an increase of 2 per cent.  It must be acknowledged that at a time of increased costs of delivering health services the Department of Health and Children is entitled to seek further revenue from whatever sources it can as contributions <Col N="560" /> towards a very costly and expensive service. The current rates of bed charges levied for private and semi-private accommodation still falls short of the full economic cost of such facilities in public hospitals.  The Department's policy is to implement charges which reflect the full economic costs of these services.  We have made some changes in the two budgets during my time in office to alter the balance in that regard, but we have not achieved that yet.</P>
    <P>The consultative process for the White Paper is almost complete.  The report of the advisory group on risk equalisation was published only in July.  A number of key interested parties wanted to see that group's recommendations.  A meeting with BUPA was held in late September, shortly after receipt of its submission.  The detailed VHI proposals on corporate structure were submitted on 30 September and a meeting was arranged between it and the Department last week.  Interdepartmental discussions will take place with the Department of Finance next week on the implications of the proposals.</P>
    <P>Further to receipt of the submissions from various Departments, the Department's actuarial and insurance advisors have been requested to review the legislative framework with a view to ensuring greater competition, stability and consumer protection.  Detailed possibilities have been identified and we should have firm proposals later in this session.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan raised the question of the VHI being authorised to act outside the State.  Currently it can act only as private health insurer within the State.  The possibility of it operating outside the jurisdiction did not arise under the current legislative framework.  That is why we are giving it powers to be an agent of an international insurer for the purpose of providing an international health care plan for citizens of the State who are temporarily resident abroad.  For Deputy McGrath's information, the VHI is a member of the Insurance Ombudsman scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise that the issues around health insurance are many and varied.  The White Paper will deal with a variety of complex issues, including the role of private health insurance in the health service, the current legislative framework and the role and corporate status of the VHI.  These are sensitive and complex issues which required a detailed input from interested parties and professional opinion.  It is anticipated that the drafting of the White Paper will be completed towards the end of this year.  I will then be in a position to bring a draft White Paper to Government for its consideration.  Although I will be part of the process at that stage, I cannot give any iron clad undertakings.  Once the Government has fully considered the matter and taken decisions on the implications of the policy proposals in any draft White Paper being prepared, I will of course make it available in the public domain as a statement of Government policy on this wide and complex area, which has spanned the tenure of successive Ministers.  I recall being <Col N="561" /> in the House as Opposition spokesperson when Deputy Noonan was Minister for Health.  This consultative process and reappraisal of the legislative framework for private health insurance was in gestation at that time.  We received nearly 70 submissions and had detailed discussions with many of those who have a keen interest in this area.  We will take their views into account before coming to a final decision at Government level.</P>
    <P>I thank everyone who spoke in the debate. Points were raised about private health insurance coverage.  I emphasise that is meant to cover primarily episodes of acute care.  Long-term patients are entitled to public hospital services.  The minimum benefit regulations cover a basic 100 days cover in respect of psychiatric services and the VHI currently provides 180 days cover in that area.  I note the core principles in relation to private health insurance are community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.</P>
    <P>The Bill is intended to enable the VHI to compete with products on offer within our current health insurance market.  It is intended that the White Paper will be completed at the end of the year and the question of the desired corporate structure for the VHI will be dealt with in that paper.  I thank Members for their contributions and look forward to returning to these issues and the specifics of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The House will wish to know the latest developments in Kosovo.  I will also outline the priorities which must now be addressed if the agreement reached by US Ambassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic earlier this week is to lead to a restoration of order in Kosovo, and the ways in which Ireland can contribute to this process, both directly and as a member of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my most recent statement to the House during the Adjournment Debate on Kosovo on 1 October, and in my earlier address to the United Nations General Assembly on 23 September, I set out the objectives of the international community. These include bringing an end to hostilities, with a withdrawal of Serb forces and a lasting ceasefire; getting talks aimed at a political <Col N="562" /> situation under way and providing humanitarian assistance to avoid the catastrophe which otherwise looms for the large numbers of displaced and shelterless Albanian population.</P>
    <P>Within these interlinked objectives the humanitarian dimension is of overriding concern. More than a quarter of a million people in Kosovo have lost their homes; more than 50,000 are living outdoors in appalling conditions, and cannot survive once the winter sets in.  In the absence of immediate action, many innocent civilians &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; will die from exposure, starvation and neglect.  The agreement between Ambassador Holbrooke and President Milosevic came about after six months of an indiscriminate reign of terror by the Serbian Government against the civilian population. These actions undermined the moderate Albanian leadership, fuelled the growth of the Kosovo Liberation Army and led to the enormous flow of refugees and displaced persons.  These actions have been halted now only by the threat of air strikes.  In welcoming the recent agreement, I regret it was ultimately the threat of force rather than the power of dialogue that brought it about.</P>
    <P>What has been agreed to by President Milosevic corresponds to what was demanded by the international community six months ago.  He and the members of his Government bear great responsibility for the consequences of their pre-varication. For too long the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Government refused to acknowledge or even recognise the international dimension of the crisis in Kosovo.  The agreement reached establishes the reality that Kosovo is an international problem.</P>
    <P>The recent phase of the crisis came to a head because of the failure of the Belgrade authorities to comply with the demands of Security Council Resolution 1199 of 23 September, thus making inevitable a humanitarian catastrophe and risking serious overspill effects in the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>Resolution 1199 called for a ceasefire by all parties and individuals, a real withdrawal and reduction of Serb forces to pre-crisis levels, a start to political negotiations, access by monitors who could also provide reassurance to the local population about safe return, unimpeded access to international organisations delivering humanitarian aid and the investigation of atrocities by the International Tribunal and other international forensic experts and the punishment of those responsible.</P>
    <P>The recent agreement addresses all of these aspects, but with additional provisions to ensure effective follow-up.  These additions were necessary to ensure full and viable implementation of its terms.  Past experience, especially in relation to Bosnia, teaches us that reaching an agreement is only the first step: full and proper implementation is crucial.</P>
    <P>It is already clear that many, especially among Kosovan Albanians, are disappointed at the agreement.  Statements issued by the Kosovo Liberation <Col N="563" /> Army make it clear that organisation will accept nothing less than full independence.  While the final outcome of negotiations between the Kosovo Albanian leadership and the authorities in Belgrade cannot be anticipated, there is a real danger that the political dialogue which should now be pursued with vigour may be undermined by dissension on the Kosovo Albanian side.  It is imperative that the conditions for political dialogue as well as for refugee return and speeded delivery of humanitarian aid be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A key dimension of this aspect will be the establishment of a secure environment.  As part of this effort it is intended that the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe establish immediately a very large verification mission on the ground.  In contrast to other OSCE missions, it has been made clear that the role of this new mission will be one of verification of the agreement, in addition to monitoring.  This entails a more active approach and requires full, unimpeded access throughout the province.</P>
    <P>Today in Vienna the OSCE is meeting to establish this mission.  I expect that in addition to contributions of personnel from OSCE member states generally, there will be a particular demand for the expertise of the EU, based on its experience with the European Community Monitoring Mission.  While many details of the mandate and other aspects of the new OSCE mission need to be clarified, including the question of arrangements for the protection of its members, who would be unarmed, I have already initiated consultations with my colleagues in Government to see how best we can contribute.</P>
    <P>Another area in which Ireland can and will contribute is that of humanitarian assistance.  The needs are daunting.  On 8 September, the United Nations launched a consolidated appeal for the more than 400,000 persons affected by the conflict, and is seeking an amount of US $54.3 million to help avert a human humanitarian catastrophe during the winter.  The International Committee of the Red Cross is expected within the coming week to expand its appeal to a total of US $10.26 million to cover the cost of its relief operation in the region.</P>
    <P>The Government has already provided £50,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for Kosovar refugees in Albania and will contribute a further £150,000 in additional assistance to the area in response to these latest appeals.</P>
    <P>Ireland with its European partners has made a contribution to the relief effort through the European Community Humanitarian Office which has announced an aid package amounting to 9.06 million ECU.  Further assistance by the European Community Humanitarian Office is being considered in the light of recent developments.</P>
    <P>This week's agreement provides a respite, a breathing space in which renewed efforts must be made to address the root causes of the problem. If the vicious circle of violence is to be broken in <Col N="564" /> Kosovo it is essential that progress is made towards an acceptable political solution.  There has already been much shuttle diplomacy through international intermediaries between the Belgrade authorities and the Kosovo Albanian leadership.  The Contact Group, on which the EU is represented and which consists of France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, the United States and the EU Presidency in office, has been particularly active in this regard, and the Ministers of the Contact Group are meeting in Paris today to assess developments.</P>
    <P>The EU has appointed a special envoy, the Presidency's Ambassador in Belgrade, to be involved in this work.  Through the Presidency we will be contributing to these efforts.  We will also work to ensure that the EU maintains maximum pressure on Belgrade, if necessary through an extension and strengthening of the sanctions already in effect.</P>
    <P>The latest developments, which hold promise for a peaceful settlement, came about only as a result of the exercise of maximum pressure by NATO on Belgrade.  Given the urgency of the situation and the lack of confidence in Serb compliance, NATO clearly intends to maintain pressure to ensure full adherence to the provisions of Resolution 1199.  It would seem desirable that the UN Security Council, which is already seized of the issue, should consider what further steps may be needed to ensure unambiguous implementation of the recent agreement and that it should adopt further decisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The experience of SFOR &mdash; the Stabilisation Force &mdash; in Bosnia is clear testimony to the value of concerted action and co-operation between the UN, NATO, the OSCE, the EU and other organisations. The seriousness of the Kosovo problem indicates that a similar approach may have to be used in addressing it.  Had the agreement of recent days not been reached, we would have been addressing a radically different situation today.  The agreement was reached and Belgrade's excesses have been halted but now comes the difficult and painstaking work of implementation.</P>
    <P>In the days, weeks and months ahead, a force of 2,000 persons will be drawn from the international community and will be deployed throughout Kosovo.  Their task will be challenging, complex and dangerous.  We should not be complacent.  At most we can be cautiously optimistic, knowing that success will in large part depend on the determination of the international community to see that the agreement is implemented in full, and to maintain whatever pressure is necessary to ensure all the parties to the conflict carry out their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I will continue to maintain close contact with my EU colleagues at the General Affairs Council and in bilateral discussions, such as those which I will have with my Greek colleague in Athens next week.  I shall keep the House informed of developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute on this issue, which has occupied the hearts and minds of all those who have read newspapers, watched television or listened to radio in recent years, especially in the last year and a half, when it has received greater international attention.  In July I attended an informal meeting of chairmen of parliamentary committees on European Affairs in Brussels, which was also attended by invitees from applicant EU countries from eastern Europe.  The most remarkable moment was during an impassioned address by an Albanian representative, who drew our attention to the serious problems besetting the region and the difficulties which were likely to arise.  He said that, even as he spoke to us the slaughter was continuing and the international community appeared incapable of intervening in a way which would force Serbia to see the error of its ways and make President Milosevic take account of world opinion.</P>
      <P>Every freedom loving person must be shocked by the atrocities in that region, which we have seen on television.  What affects us most is the inability of observers to do anything more than we are doing today, that is, expressing our revulsion. As time passes, we will hear of atrocities far worse than anything so far made known to us.  In recent days, military police have told refugees it was safe to return to their homes, whereupon they shot them.</P>
      <P>At a time like this, we must reflect on what the EU, the OSCE, NATO and the USA have been able to achieve.  It concentrates our minds on the recurring problems since the fall of the Iron Curtain, when old allegiances and historic differences have re-emerged.  There is a great need to establish a force which can keep the peace but is also sufficiently resourceful to make an impact on those at whom it is directed.  As the Minister said, the slaughter of ethnic Albanians would have continued but for the intervention of NATO and the threat of force.  In those circumstances one must ask why this did not happen before.</P>
      <P>We know the various backgrounds and cultures which are interwoven in this area.  In view of the slaughter which has taken place, including the annihilation of villages, action must be taken and responsibility rests more than ever before on the EU, the UN and NATO.  It is sad that we must rely on NATO to deal with problems in Europe. If the perpetrators of these atrocities think NATO or the US are otherwise occupied, they feel free to continue without having to answer to anyone &mdash; they are not democrats so this does not worry them.  However, we must follow up their atrocities by examining them in an international war crimes tribunal.  The tribunals already dealing with that region must step up their work and challenge those in authority who are doing nothing to halt the present slaughter and everything to ensure it continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must also consider our role.  We want to see an equitable and lasting peace, we have seen similar problems on our own island and have first <Col N="566" /> hand experience of those matters.  Whether we like it or not there comes a time when we must come down on one side or the other as to whether a course of action should be followed.  It may be said that we are neutral and cannot advocate military intervention, and many in this country would throw their hands up in horror at such a suggestion. However, having observed what has gone on for so long, there is no sense putting forward resolutions which clearly are ineffective.  EU member countries, like Ireland, must be sufficiently persuasive to convince the perpetrators of violence to talk.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made the valid point that the ethnic Albanians have their own agenda which might not be good for the stability of the region or, ultimately, the rest of Europe.  This brings us back to the need for a Europe-based approach to the problems of the region, which could best be taken by the EU.  Perhaps the OSCE would be a suitable vehicle.  Whatever means is found to deal with the problem, it must be found soon.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the proposals put forward by Mr. Holbrook will be successful.  If the Serbian authorities feel the US is disengaging from the problem or has other pressing issues to attend to, President Milosevic and his cohorts will proceed on the same basis as previously.  The most shocking thing about current events is that we see what is happening night after night on our televisions, graphically presented in every household, but we can do nothing about it.  Even though we are all Europeans, we tend to divorce ourselves from the immediate arena and say that someone else should do something.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the only way peace can be restored, even in the interim, is in the way now being proposed.  Negotiation without the threat of force have been shown in the past to carry no weight in that region.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and encourage him to use every opportunity, as Ireland's representative at the Council of Ministers' meeting, to ensure the revulsion of the Irish people is progressed, through the Minister, into encouraging action by the international community to influence NATO or the OSCE to devise a means of ensuring that conflicts of this nature are not allowed to continue, because while a resolution is sought people are dying.  The saddest thing about this kind of ethnic violence is that because of the obvious hatred and detestation of communities for each other, the level of the degradation to which they are prepared to go seems worse than anything that occurred in wars that we know about.  I hope, therefore, Ireland will use its influence to ensure it is brought to the attention of the oppressors at every possible opportunity that Europe, and Ireland as a member of the European Union, is not at all amused at what has happened, and that the pursuance of war criminals should be a major priority.  Every opportunity should be availed of to ensure the perpetrators of these atrocities recognise that they will ultimately <Col N="567" /> have to answer for their crimes and that this will not necessarily be in the long-term.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to express solidarity and sympathy with the victims.  I do not know what else we can do.  However, as time goes by our arguments will get weaker if the same scenario presents itself again and again, if we come up against the same obstacles and have not advanced our cause.  I emphasise that at some stage in the not too distant future Europe will have to look seriously at a means of intervening, by way of peace-keeping or peace-enforcement, to ensure regimes such as the one in question are not allowed to engage indefinitely in their atrocious campaigns of genocide.</P>
    <P>I applaud the degree to which this and other countries have made aid available.  Greater efforts should be made to convey the necessary assistance to the areas that need it most to ensure the unfortunate people who have had to flee from their own towns and villages into the countryside, into the hills and the mountains, are given early protection in a military sense but also in the more obvious and fundamental sense of staving off hunger which must become a serious issue, particularly coming into the winter months.  With today's modern technology it should not be impossible to get aid directly to the affected areas quickly.  Heretofore military activity was a deterrent, but if military activity can now be controlled to the extent that it is possible to fly in supplies, that must be of prior importance in the context of the onslaught of winter.  A week at this juncture might be worth many lives.  A month could be worth a colossal number of lives.  I ask the Minister to use his influence specifically in the areas in question to do a job that needs to be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very tragic issue.  What Deputy Durkan has said is interesting in another way, and I want to say in the presence of the Minister that it is becoming very urgent that we have a debate as soon as possible in this House on the future role of the United Nations which would include, for example, the role of the Security Council within a restructured United Nations and the purpose, use and abuse of the veto in the Security Council. The use of the veto in the Security Council in the present instance by Russia is serving as a shield for President Milosevic.  When the Minister states there are many on the Kosovo-Albanian side who would not welcome this agreement he is right, for a number of reasons.  It begins by omitting entirely what the Kosovo-Albanians stress as a long-term goal of political independence, speaking instead of autonomy.  That will almost automatically lead to its rejection by a significant number of those who are involved.  On the other side, serious questions have been raised, including the last one on humanitarian aid, its independence and freedom of delivery separate from mediation by the regime of President Milosevic; <Col N="568" /> whether the refugees will return, given the uncertainty of their situation and the presence of those who were the perpetuators of crimes against them; and finally, whether the political dialogue will quench the short to medium-term prospects.</P>
      <P>Ten years ago I was Foreign Affairs spokesperson for the Labour Party and I recall the impatience with which people supported the German initiative on the recognition of Croatia.  At that time I advised that we should be very careful, that the glue which held together people who differed very much in terms of ethnicity, religion and culture was very fragile.  Indeed, in a precipitous way that initiative, taken unilaterally by Germany within the European Union, set a chain of events in motion which visited incredible tragedy not only in the present sense of Kosovo but earlier in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  I recall as well some years ago meeting people from Kosovo when visiting the European Union.  It is hard to conclude other than they were simply forgotten, left aside in relation to the Dayton Accord and that it was afterwards they were constructed as a regional problem within a bigger problem.  Now we are seeing the really tragic results to all of this.  In the statements we make, we must also consider the balance between military action and diplomacy. The reason I mention that we need a debate soon on the role of the United Nations is that there is a general drift in international affairs in favour of military action which downplays the possibility and capacity of diplomacy.  It is a very serious circumstance in international policy, one that should be part of a fuller debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1996, on behalf of the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Commissioners of Public Works applied to Clare <Col N="569" /> County Council for planning permission for an entry point, consisting of limited visitor facilities at Mullaghmore, County Clare, comprising a covered waiting area, toilets, ranger accommodation, ancillary parking, storage area and signage.</P>
    <P>In July 1997 Clare County Council informed my Department that the application for planning permission constituted a material contravention of the county development plan.  In these circumstances a 75 per cent majority vote of councillors at a formal meeting of Clare County Council was required for planning permission to be granted. Deputies will be aware that at a meeting of Clare County Council on 15 September last such a majority was not achieved and, accordingly, planning permission was refused.  On 13 October 1998 the Commissioners of Public Works, on my behalf, appealed that decision to An Bord Pleanála, which will make its decision in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>What has happened to the original plan for a major interpretative centre at this location, with which she did not disagree and which was endorsed by the current Taoiseach? When in Opposition he clearly said that if returned to power his party would proceed to build what was originally conceived.  In the context of the appeal lodged by the Commissioners for Public Works, is it the Minister's intention to provide on the site at Mullaghmore the limited facilities involved in this plan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is perfectly right in saying that the original plan differed quite substantially from the present one which has now been appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  He will be aware that there was an intervening Administration between the original plan and the present position.  The Administration that was then in place, and in which the Deputy was a Minister, proposed a plan which was in the name of the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  As the Deputy is aware, that plan was put to Clare County Council and was refused because they did not get the 75 per cent majority. Because of that refusal I have now put forward my appeal to An Bord Pleanála in the usual way. I await the planning process to proceed in its independent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister's reply that her appeal is on the basis of Clare County Council's refusal to grant a material contravention. When Clare County Council suggested a material contravention was necessary, did the Minister take legal advice?  Is her appeal now within the context of planning or is it against Clare County Council's exercise of a right to seek a material contravention?  Did the Minister take advice on the merit of abandoning the current application to Clare County Council and proceeding with the suggested plans for the three centres at Corofin, Kilfenora and Ballyvaughan? Must these three centres now wait until the planning <Col N="570" /> appeal process is over or will funding, as promised, be made available for them?  Did the Minister have meetings with any of the parties involved, before or after the appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the material contravention, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, I never accepted that the plan contravened the 1998 county development plan.  This has always been my view, particularly because a previous planning application for a larger development was not considered to be in contravention of the plan.  Therefore, I logically believed that this plan could not be considered as a material convention.  However, that was my own personal view I put forward to the county council.  On numerous occasions I have expressed that view when the matter has arisen in parliamentary questions, and I still hold that view.</P>
      <P>Given the basis on which Clare County Council turned down the application, it is incumbent upon me to appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which I have already done.  I can assure the House that I have sought legal advice all along the way.  Deputy Higgins knows, more than most, the legal difficulties that have arisen with regard to this case over a period of seven to eight years.  There have been a number of court cases with regard to this matter.  I do not have a legal training, as the Deputy is well aware.  It would be presumptuous of me to believe that I understood the law in this respect, so I have sought legal advice on the matter whenever necessary.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been put forward with regard to funding the proposed centres in Kilfenora and Corofin They are being considered and there is an ongoing discussion between my Department and both places in this regard.  In his report on Mullaghmore, the proposed entry sites and what could be done for the Burren, the county council planning officer wished all three projects to move together.  In light of that, we must move forward with regard to Kilfenora and Corofin, which are further back than the entry point proposal for Mullaghmore.  Designs for planning permission have to be drawn up.  I wish to bring all this on stream so that we can move forward, depending on how things go with regard to the planning appeal.  I will not try to second guess An Bord Pleanála's decision.  I have to deal with the situation as it is.  I am complying with the planning officer's report to the county council which says that all three centres should move together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the preparation of plans for Kilfenora and Corofin include a contingency provision in the event of the Minister's appeal not being successful?  In other words, is the planning and preparation in Corofin and Kilfenora going ahead in such a way that it could be expanded or developed in the event of the Minister's appeal not being successful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to look at the negative side of this matter.  We will be putting <Col N="571" /> forward a very strong case for our appeal.  It will obviously be up to An Bord Pleanála to decide in its usual independent way on that case.  I hope the decision I would like to see will come from An Bord Pleanála.  Based on that, I feel it is incumbent upon me, as Minister, to continue to work on the other centres at Corofin and Kilfenora because no work had been done on either of these sites.  They had to start from the beginning. Those proposals were put forward by me, they have been considered and have been worked upon.  We are trying to see what we can do to facilitate everyone within the north Clare area, not only in enhancing and preserving the national heritage but also in exploiting, in the most sensitive meaning of that term, north Clare for general tourism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Not all of the Minister's making.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given her view on what she would like to see emerge from the decision of the planning appeals board.  I am sure she is anxious to build up the confidence and trust of the people of north Clare.  Despite the fact that she has had frequent contact with the communities of Kilfenora, Corofin and Ballyvaughan, why has she not been able to arrive at an agreement with them?  Why is it taking so long to arrive at a positive decision regarding these communities which would not adversely impact on the Mullaghmore site?  Does she not consider it would be a major confidence boosting measure to be able to say to those communities in north Clare that she is willing to reach an agreement with them as a basis from which to start and that the legal implications arising from the planning appeals board will take their course following the oral hearing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention has been to try to build trust and confidence within the north Clare area.  There has been a great deal of concern and anxiety on both sides.  This situation has developed over the past seven to eight years and I have been in office for only a year and some months.  In taking over that obligation as Minister, I have done and will continue to do everything to resolve the matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying I have had frequent contact with all groups on all sides regarding the issue.  It is not a question of me not being able to reach agreement or that there is disagreement with regard to Corofin or Kilfenora.  Proposals were put to both communities.  It is not a question of me dictating what any community should have; I do not believe in that kind of approach.  I have made offers and proposals and it is up to the communities to decide whether they wish to proceed with that or continue consultation with my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware the Government agreed to my proposals for broadcasting legislation on 22 July 1998.  One of the main elements is the provision of a statutory regime which will facilitate the early introduction here of digital broadcasting services, in particular digital terrestrial television.  The proposed legislation will also create the necessary structures for the regulation of broadcasting services from a broadcasting and cultural perspective across all platforms, terrestrial, cable, MMDS and satellite.</P>
      <P>The necessary legislation is being drafted as a matter of urgency and I intend to present the Bill to the House during this session.  Concurrently with the drafting process, arrangements for the selection of a partner for RTE to form the commercial entity which will be responsible for the provision of transmission and technical facilities to broadcasters in the new digital era is under way.  I am also asking the newly appointed Independent Radio and Television Commission to make all possible advance preparations for the expanded role envisaged for that body under the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>At this stage, I hope the legislative and practical arrangements for the establishment of the digital terrestrial television infrastructure will be in place by June of next year and that DTT services will be available in the middle or latter half of the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to have a digital terrestrial method of transmission. The digital revolution in terms of satellite began last Sunday in Britain with 57 channels being provided.  That will have a serious impact here between now and June next year in that consumers will want to purchase the set top boxes which are preprogrammed with the other channels. I am aware from discussions that there is a serious move within the Minister's Department to have Digico set up.  That is vital.</P>
      <P>When the broadcasting legislation is brought before the House, will the Minister be in a position to give primacy to the Irish television networks on the channels to be allocated in Ireland? Studies from the United States show that those who switch channels on their television sets for the first few minutes invariably return to the first few channels.  According to the Government programme for action, if there is to be an Irishness about our television content and what is broadcast to the people, it is important the Minister is able to guarantee primacy of channels to the Irish television networks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with some of the Deputy's remarks.  The legislation I will publish <Col N="573" /> this session is the first comprehensive broadcasting legislation in the past ten years.  It is obviously much needed if we are to be to the fore in this technological revolution.  It is very important Ireland takes its place in that revolution.  I accept and appreciate Deputy Kenny's recognition that the preparation for Digico is well under way in my Department.</P>
      <P>I also accept what he said about channels because a number of studies conducted in the US and elsewhere prove that people are likely to use only one to nine channels and that a conscious decision must be made to go beyond nine.  That is not the way I use my television buttons but such use has been proven by these studies.  The cultural import and quality of programmes on RTE and Telefís na Gaeilge has been of the highest standard.  With the onset of the new technologies, there will be an onslaught from other cultures, so it is important that our Irish identity is not swamped.  However, it is the consumer's choice.</P>
      <P>Regarding the electronic programme guides with which Deputy Kenny is particularly concerned, one of the new responsibilities of the expanded Independent Radio and Television Commission will be to draw up guidelines for the electronic programme guides.  The intention is that indigenous broadcasters will not be disadvantaged on Irish digital platforms.  We have no control over BSkyB content.  It is one issue which will occupy a great deal of the new Independent Radio and Television Commission's time in discussions and resolutions.  It is a matter which must be carefully monitored to see how our indigenous stations can be best promoted.  It is important that is done to protect our own cultural identity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Four full meetings of the committee have already taken place as well as a number of bilateral <Col N="574" /> meetings with the various Departments represented on the committee.  The main role of the committee is to assist me and my Department in ensuring Government policy in relation to the offshore Islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish language is implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner.  A number of issues have been discussed by the committee concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of adequate levels of services for islanders, the promotion of the sustainable development of our offshore islands, the promotion of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht, the development of the Gaeltacht and the promotion of Irish throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Although the programme for Government, which was put to the electorate at the last general election, included provision for an islander allowance, the Minister of State did not refer to any discussion about that allowance taking place at the interdepartmental committee. What is the position regarding the islander allowance? When I visited the islands I discovered that distance from the mainland and the lack of landing facilities are causing great difficulties.  In that context, the islander allowance appears to be a good idea.  Why has there been a delay in introducing it?  Has the Minister of State obtained agreement from the Department of Finance about this?</P>
      <P>In his reply the Minister of State referred to the way the interdepartmental committee considered the problems of the Gaeltacht islands.  I remind him that there are also non-Gaeltacht islands.  In the report on the islands, originally commissioned by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, great emphasis was laid on the way in which non-Gaeltacht islands had been neglected by successive Governments.  The Minister of State did not indicate that he has made any effort to ensure that non-Gaeltacht islands are treated equitably.  He spoke about giving encouragement to islands in Gaeltacht areas but failed to mention non-Gaeltacht islands.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Deputy on securing £1 million per year for the islands when he served as Minister of State.  However, that figure was increased to £1.6 million this year. Moneys far in excess of that figure have already been allocated to projects which were approved and are now under way.  During the past week I announced the provision of grants amounting to £1.1 million to non-Gaeltacht areas on the Cork islands.  These were additional to the £570,000 already allocated.  This year I have already allocated £2 million to the Cork islands, only one of which is a Gaeltacht island.</P>
      <P>The islander allowance is being considered by the Interdepartmental Committee on the Islands. Unfortunately, the committee has considered so many matters involving the Gaeltacht, the islands and the Irish language that I would not have time to provide details at this stage.  However, I assure the Deputy that the matter is under consideration but a decision on it will have to be taken in the budgetary context.</P>

      <P>As I explained in the reply I gave the Deputy to question No. 30 on 18 June, it did not prove possible to fill this post when it was advertised last year following the retirement of the last permanent director.  There was nothing to indicate that the outcome would be any different this year and at the request of the trustees of the National Library I agreed not to proceed with a competition to fill the position.  I decided that the current arrangements for carrying out the duties of the post, which are working very satisfactorily, should continue in place for another year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>How long is it since the former director retired from office?  Does the Minister not believe it is highly undesirable that the post of director of one of our major national cultural institutions should be left vacant for so long and that the position of director is critical in terms of the future development of the National Library, as evidenced by the outstanding contribution and performance in that post by Dr. Donlon who transformed the library during her term of office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Gilmore in congratulating Dr. Donlon on the work she did during her term as director of the National Library. In 1997, following her retirement on grounds of ill health &mdash; my Department requested the Civil Service Commission to organise a competition to fill the post of director of the National Library. That competition failed to yield a suitable candidate for the position.  The question of requesting the Civil Service Commission to seek to fill the post by public competition was reassessed in 1998 but there was no evidence to suggest that a suitable candidate would emerge from such a competition at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate that the trustees of the National Library requested that the current arrangements should be allowed to continue.  I gladly acceded to their request.  I will review the situation again in mid-1999.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue &mdash; former Secretary of the Department of the Environment and Local Government &mdash; for his tremendous foresight and his work and commitment to the National Library.  He has addressed a number of issues, including extending the opening hours of reading rooms to include Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.  Lunchtime closure of the library will be discontinued with effect from this <Col N="577" /> month.  I could list many other issues if the Deputy so requires but I do not want to take up too much time because there may be further supplementary questions.  However, if the Deputy requires further information I can provide it here in the House or by way of letter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a remarkable tribute to Dr. Donlon that it appears she is irreplaceable.  What did the Minister mean when she stated it is unlikely that another competition would produce a candidate capable of doing the job?  Does that mean that there is no one available who is capable of filling the position of director of the National Library?  That seems an extraordinary stance for the Minister to take.  I concur with her about the work being done by Mr. O'Donoghue but I do not agree with filling the post on a temporary basis for a prolonged period.  That would not be good for the National Library.  Will the Minister review the position and proceed with another competition to fill the post?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As already stated, this matter was considered in 1997 when the competition failed to yield a suitable candidate.  The situation was reassessed in 1998 and I outlined the position in that regard.  I also stated that it will be reviewed in mid-1999.  The work of the National Library and its importance cannot be over-emphasised.  I recognised this by ensuring the allocation of significant increases in funding to the National Library so that its work could progress.  As already stated, that work has been expedited by Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue who has proven to be particularly competent.  I have every intention of reviewing the situation in mid-1999.  It is my intention that the National Library will be a statutory body under the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, from the beginning of the year 2000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with others who have paid tribute to Dr. Donlon, who has served in this position with distinction and I pay tribute to Mr. O'Donoghue who has been administering since Dr. Donlon's resignation.</P>
      <P>Are there aspects of the post or conditions which are limiting the field of applicants so as not to produce a potential director?  The Director of the National Library of Ireland is one of the most distinguished posts in Europe.  One therefore wonders why applicants are not coming from the ranks of librarianship.  Will the Minister comment on the distinction between filling the post by a librarian from the ethos of librarianship and by an administrator because they are different tasks? I pay tribute to the administrative reforms which have taken place, but it raises the question as to why a librarian is not Director of the National Library of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What would change the Minister's mind in the middle of 1999 to allow a competition to take place?  Is she in a position to tell the House what circumstance is present in 1998 which leads her <Col N="578" /> to the conclusion that a competition would not draw a candidate?  Of course the opinion of the trustees is always valuable, but is it the opinion of the Civil Service Commission that it would fail to attract a librarian for one of the most distinguished posts available in librarianship?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated, I was advised &mdash; that advice was also available to the trustees of the National Library &mdash; that the post was not likely to be filled.  They found that the work of Mr. O'Donoghue was extremely satisfactory and asked that he be retained for some time to deal with the situation in the National Library. He is certainly dealing effectively with the matter.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to a parliamentary question which I put to the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, on 8 April 1997 when I was in Opposition.  I asked about the status of the Director of the National Library, particularly with regard to salaries and I got an interesting reply.  The then Minister said he expected the salary for the post would over time reach the maximum for the grade.  It will be noted that the former director also remained on the first point of the scale.</P>
      <P>No doubt the question of salaries is a major consideration by any applicant.  As a former Minister, Deputy Higgins will be aware of the procedures which must take place and the parameters within which one must work with regard to increasing salary scales in the normal way.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to say that the work of Mr. O'Donoghue has been exemplary.  I would not like anyone in this House to feel that because he does not have the title of director he is not capable of doing an excellent job.  He has proven that he is capable since he took up that position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is casting the slightest doubt over the contribution of Mr. O'Donoghue. We have all acknowledged his contribution.  The Minister did not answer the question as to why there has not been an application from the community of librarians.</P>
      <P>She referred to her question of 8 April 1997.  It is now October 1998.  Her suggestion had considerable merit, but will she tell the House how successful she was in the interim in convincing the Minister for Finance to upgrade the post?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an obvious question for any Member of the Opposition to ask.  I asked it when Deputy Higgins was Minister, and I am in the position to give him the same answer he gave on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of staffing and salaries is a matter for the Minister for Finance and the Government. There are certain parameters within which we must all work.  Those parameters are obvious and they have been restated again and again in Government policy, not least by the Minister for Finance.  I would like to see a substantial increase in the salary of the person who takes on the onerous position of director because we all know it is <Col N="579" /> a particularly prestigious job because of the wonderful collection which thankfully is in the museum.  That is recognised not only nationally but internationally.  Because Deputy Higgins was Minister in the previous Administration, he will know the exact difficulties in this regard.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to modify the school curriculum by placing more emphasis on cultural and artistic activities.  The Deputy will appreciate that the question of bringing forward amendments or changes to the curriculum is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. However, I assure the Deputy of my continuing concern as Minister charged with the promotion and development of the arts to seek to ensure an adequate and appropriate emphasis on the arts within our educational system from primary level right through to third level.  In this regard I have had ongoing bilateral discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, on this matter.  Recently we decided to establish a formal liaison committee between our two Departments and An Chomhairle Ealaíon, whose terms of reference are to assess the development and implementation of the school curriculum in the context of helping to ensure the curriculum places more emphasis on cultural and artistic activities as promised in the programme for Government.  This committee will have its first meeting in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply.  I do not have difficulty accepting the Minister's commitment, but my question asked for the details of the formal meetings between officials of her Department and the Department of Education and Science.  How many meetings took place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, we wanted to talk Minister to Minister, as Ministers with responsibility for education and the arts.  I said on a number of occasions that I would like to see far greater emphasis on drama and music in particular from primary school level. When talking about education, we are talking about a holistic approach and to that extent it must incorporate the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister for Education and Science <Col N="580" /> has a particular interest in this because he showed a great commitment to the arts long before he became a Minister.  It was along those lines that we discussed how best to proceed.  We then decided to set up a liaison committee not only between the two Departments but we also included An Chomhairle Ealaíon because it has a direct connection with the Department of Education and Science in terms of supplying certain services with regard to the arts and younger people.  The terms of reference are to assess the development and implementation of the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that there has been a comprehensive review of the arts plan because I was able to deliver on the £26 million for this year which meant the present arts plan would conclude one year in advance of the time proposed by the last Administration.  Of course we need another plan and we need to examine the last plan to see how we can improve on it. That will be the basis for the new plan.  Major public consultations took place and there were also consultations with the community generally. I mention this because during the extensive public consultation process concern was expressed by the arts community about the place of art in the school curriculum.  This view will be made known during the consultations and will no doubt be reflected in the arts plan.  It will bolster my view and that of the Minister for Education and Science that it should translate into the curriculum, especially for younger people.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has done in this area.  I was able to increase arts funding from £10.1 million to more than £20 million. I have already congratulated her for securing £26 million.

The Minister will spend the remainder of her term in office fighting administrative battles in the trenches. Unless she gives this matter the priority she and the Minister for Education and Science believe is necessary, there will be no need for a liaison committee to arrange endless meetings and discussions. In the meantime it is important that the views of both Ministers be communicated to An Comhairle Ealaíon.</P>
      <P>How long does the Minister envisage the process of change before we see the implementation of her views on music and drama in the curriculum?

      <P>I agree with the Deputy in that it is important to see what can be done from a number of different angles to make a concerted and co-ordinated effort in that regard.  The arts can play a very important role in the development of children with special needs, for example, the Ark does very important work in children's theatre.  I was happy to attend a performance at the Ark last night.  It was good to see the participation of young people and children from the audience, which is surely what education is about. It is something the Minister for Education and Science recognises and the Deputy is right to say we are working in a concerted and co-ordinated way to achieve these aims.</P>

      <P>A request has not been received by my Department for approval to restore the <i>Asgard.</i>  If such a request is received by my Department it will require a licence under section 25 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended by section 20 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, and the National Cultural Institutions Act, 1997, as I am advised that the <i>Asgard</i> comes within the definition of &ldquo;archaeological object&rdquo; contained in this body of legislation.  A request would be carefully and thoroughly considered since the vessel is an important historic artefact of national significance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not surprised because contrary to what the Deputy may have heard or read in a newspaper report, the Minister for Defence had consulted me on this matter before his announcement.  As Minister for Defence, he is the legal owner of the <i>Asgard.</i>  He agreed, in principle, to its restoration to seaworthy condition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean the Minister and the Minister for Defence made a political decision that the <i>Asgard</i> should be restored, in advance of a formal application for permission to restore it?  Does she agree with the position announced by the Minister for Defence?</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the <Col N="584" /> Deputy said, that an advance decision made.  I am not in a position to consider the matter from a ministerial viewpoint because I have not received a request for a licence.  Until one comes in, I am not aware of the details and until I am aware of the details, I am not in a position to make a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Members would find the distinction between a formal application for a licence and the discussion the Minister for Defence had with the Minister quite interesting. Does the Minister agree with the position announced by the Minister for Defence, that the <i>Asgard</i> is to be restored and put to sea again?  Did she agree with the Minister for Defence when he discussed that matter with her?  Presumably he told her he intended to make that announcement or to take some initiative in that regard.  Did she give her approval or agree with that, or did the Minister for Defence announce this without the approval or agreement of the Minister present?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of agreement between Ministers.  The person who owns the vessel is the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Defence.  For it to be considered for conservation, a licence must be obtained from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  For a licence to be obtained, an application must be made and details given.  I am not aware of those details because an application has not been made.  Therefore, I am sure the Deputy will accept the logic that I have not made a decision and that it would be foolish of me to make one in advance of getting the information available.  It is important to note the Minister of Defence is aware that my primary concern is for the conservation of the historical vessel and he has accordingly approved the project, in principle, but subject to the restoration group obtaining a licence from my Department.</P>

      <P>The Chief State Solicitor's office indicated that the <i>Asgard</i> came under the <Col N="585" /> category of an archeological object.

      <P>The Minister has told us the opinion of the Chief State Solicitor on this matter.

      <P>It appears the Deputy is trying to be invidious because there is no great mystery. The Minister is the owner of this vessel and if he wants to check the position, he is the person who would have to take the initiative.  I have yet to receive such an application.  The legal advice received by my Department from the Chief State Solicitor's office indicates that the <i>Asgard</i> would come under the category of an archeological object.  There is no statutory obligation on me, but it has been the practice for the Minister to seek the advice of the Director of the National Museum of Ireland on applications for licences to alter such archeological objects.  That is what I intend to do.  There is no mystery.  I am waiting for that application and when it comes in it will be considered in the usual way.  There were no cosy chats between the Minister for Defence and me or with anyone else on this issue.</P>

      <P>The function of each of the five national parks administered by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, is the conservation of nature encompassing the preservation of habitat and species of flora and fauna etc.  The preservation of the habitat ensures that an endangered species does not become extinct which might occur but for the protection provided within the national park.  An example of work undertaken to preserve the habitat is the removal of rhododendron bushes in Killarney and Glenveagh national parks which otherwise would stifle native trees and threaten the various species which depend on the woodland habitat. As a comprehensive approach is taken to fulfill these tasks, it is not possible to give a breakdown of expenditure solely relating to endangered species.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad there is movement on that and I am sure that is appreciated by the Deputy.  The definition of a national park is concise. It covers areas which exist to conserve natural plant and animal communities in scenic landscapes, which are both extensive and of national importance, and under conditions compatible with that purpose to ensure the public can visit and appreciate them.  That work has been done assiduously in the five national parks and I am sure that type of work will be done with the same enthusiasm when the national park is opened in Mayo.</P>
      <P>I will check if the information the Deputy requested on endangered species is available, but the management of our national parks is conscious of the need to protect endangered species. Those species that require protection are listed in the Irish Red Databook, the annex to the Habitats Directive, and are scheduled under the Wildlife Act.  The Deputy will find all the necessary information in those publications, but he is welcome to contact my Department if he requires further information.</P>

The Deputy and I know there are only 3,000 people permanently living on islands.

      <P>However, that is not the problem.  Other issues must be taken into account.  I must disappoint the Deputy by saying that when a decision is made we will announce it.  When an amount is decided we will announce it.  I will not say when a decision will be made.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>In March of this year the Minister for Education and Science and I jointly established an interdepartmental working group to examine and report back on the feasibility of establishing an academy for the performing arts, including a conservatoire at Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The working group under the chairmanship of Mr. Noel Lindsay issued an interim report at the end of July.  This interim report, which has many aspects to it, is being considered by me and my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science. Without prejudging the outcome of our deliberations I can say that in its interim report the working group has concluded that the Earlsfort Terrace site is suitable and could be adapted for use as an academy for the performing arts.  The group supports the idea of locating the academy there provided certain critical issues can be resolved.  When our consideration of the interim report has been concluded my colleague and I will move the project forward to the next stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.</P>
      <P>This is a major project referred to specifically in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The group dealing with this matter was given a mandate because the centre and site were named in the programme.  Therefore, it was not necessary for it to conclude that the site was suitable.  Will the Minister circulate the interim report?  Did the report arrive at any final conclusion on the overall cost of the project and when it might be undertaken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was important that the report was presented on time at the end of July, as it will be the basis for our considerations.  My preference is to use the Earlsfort Terrace site. However, the group had to examine whether it was feasible.  It has decided it is, although certain critical issues must be resolved before any work is undertaken.  One of those issues is the actual acquisition of the site.  I cannot give an estimate of the cost of the proposed academy.  Negotiations will have to take place with University College Dublin which owns the site.</P>

      <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge mar ábhar sa churaclam scoile is gnó don Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta é sin.  I dtaca leis sin de dírím aird an Teachta ar Alt 30 den Bhille Oideachais (Uimh.  2), 1997, a bhaineann le cúrsaí curaclaim. Ar ndóigh, tá suim speisialta agam mar Aire Stáit a bhfuil freagracht air i leith na Gaeilge, agus mar Theachta Dála do cheantar Gaeltachta, i múineadh na Gaeilge sna scoileanna agus i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa chóras oideachais. Léirím an tsuim sin go rialta don Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta trí mholtaí a chur faoina bhráid <Col N="591" /> le breithniú agus bíonn cruinnithe agam leis ó thráth go céile.  Tá sé socraithe againn go mbunófar coiste liaison ionadaíoch den dá Roinn chun ceisteanna a bhaineann, inter alia, leis an nGaeilge sa chóras oideachais go ginearálta a phlé.  Ar ndóigh, tá ionadaíocht ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta ar an gCoiste Idir-Rannach do na hOileáin, an Ghaeltacht and an Ghaeilge a bhfuilim féin mar Chathaoirleach air.</P>

      <P>Ni theastaíonn uaimse a bheith ag freagairt ceisteanna gur chóir a chur ar an Aire Oideachais.  Ar ndóigh, is léir do dhuine ar bith, agus ní bheadh cúis ar bith le gaelscoileanna, muna mbeifeá ag súil go mbeadh Gaeilge níos feárr ag gasúir sna gaelscoileanna thar mar a bheadh ag gasúir i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liomsa gurb é an ról atá agamsa mar Aire Stáit ná go mbaineann an Ghaeilge le níos mó ná na scoileanna agus go bhfuilimid ag iarraidh an obair atá á dhéanamh sna scoileanna ag múinteoirí agus ag na scoileanna i gcoitinne a shnaidhmiú leis an dul chun cinn atá thar ag iarraidh a chur ar aghaidh ó thaobh na Gaeilge de sa phobal i gcoitinne.  Tagann an dá rud sin taobh le taobh.  Mar shampla, tá's ag chuile dhuine agus tá's agatsa go minic go bhfuil an dearcadh ag gasúir scoile nach fiú dóibh Gaeilge a bheith acu mar nach mbaineann an Ghaeilge taobh amuigh den scoil.</P>

Creidim má dhéanaimid ar an mbealach sin é go mbeidh tionchar nach beag ag an obair a bheidh á dhéanamh againn mar go dtuigfidh gasúir go mbaineann an Ghaeilge le níos mó ná díreach ábhar scoile.</P>

      <P>I have attended two meetings with European Cultural Ministers in the last year, the first of which was the formal Council of Ministers meeting under the auspices of the Luxembourg Presidency on 27 November 1997.  The second was the informal Council of Ministers meeting under the Austrian Presidency in Linz on 11 September.</P>
      <P>The main topic discussed at the meeting in November 1997 was the role of music in Europe in respect of which the Luxembourg Presidency had drawn up conclusions.  The development of these conclusions and recommendations was initiated during the Irish Presidency.  They were supported unanimously at the November meeting and presented to the European Commission for consideration in the development of European initiatives in the area of culture.</P>
      <P>The meeting also discussed the European Commission's proposal, dated 4 November 1997, for a European Parliament and Council decision concerning a Community initiative in respect of the European City of Culture.  The Council, on foot of a proposal developed during the UK Presidency, subsequently adopted a common position radically different from the European Commission proposal.  It is still necessary to receive the views of the European Parliament on the European Commission's proposal before the basis on which the designation of European culture capitals will proceed after the year 2004 is formally established.  There has been intergovernmental agreement to the designations up to the year 2004.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main item on the agenda at the informal meeting in Linz on 11 September was the achievement of a common position on the first <Col N="593" /> European Community Framework Programme in support of Culture, 2000-04, which was presented by the European Commission in May and which is to replace the current programmes in the field of culture &mdash; KALEIDOSCOPE, ARIANE and RAPHAEL.  Ireland generally welcomed the European Commission's proposal and, in particular, the co-operative approach proposed.  I did, however, express concern, which was shared by a number of delegations, that the proposed programme was directed towards supporting major emblematic projects and requested that it cater for small and medium-sized projects.  The Austrian Presidency is seeking to achieve a common position.</P>
    <P>The meeting also agreed to the proposal that the current programmes, ARIANE and KALEIDOSCOPE, be extended beyond the end of this year to ensure continued action in 1999 in advance of the adoption and implementation of the proposed single European programme.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that informative reply.  The Minster, on a number of occasions, has said in reply to my questions that her Department has no responsibility for the cultural relations committee which comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Yet she, as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands quite rightly attends meetings of the Council of European Cultural Ministers.  Is it her intention to take responsibility for the cultural relations committee in view of her strong input to the European cultural movement and would this not be a realistic arrangement?</P>

      <P>When my Department was set up by the last Administration and very ably headed by Deputy Higgins, the cultural relations committee was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That situation continues.  As Minister with responsibility for the arts and culture it is important that I be present at meetings of the Council of Ministers to make sure that Ireland's view is strongly voiced.  That will continue to be the case.  I have no immediate plans to lobby the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take over the cultural relations committee. However, that is an interesting proposal and I may consider it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will get the information required by Deputy Higgins on the decisions of the cultural ministers on proposals by the DG 10.  I can also get any <Col N="594" /> information he requires with regard to guarantees concerning film.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned on this matter, I urged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for a fuller debate on the role of the United Nations, particularly on the restructuring of that organisation, the role of the Security Council within it and the use of the veto.  I got the impression that the Minister would assent to my request.  It would be appropriate to have such a debate ranging from a consideration of the late Erskine Childers' and Brian Urquhart's discussion on the matter to other considerations made by other institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I relate to that a further point which is extremely important and about which people are extremely and unhelpfully reticent.  The character of our foreign policy has crucially changed with the emergence of a single world power.  This means that frequently when we are discussing matters of international affairs and foreign policy we are very quickly moved to the crude question of whether or not we are in favour of military intervention.  The balance between military intervention and extended diplomacy is moving very strongly in favour of what might be called the <Col N="595" /> simplistic crudities of whether or not we are afraid to act.</P>
    <P>Recent articles, including one by a former US diplomat posted here attacking John Pilger and the Minster for Foreign Affairs, quite disgracefully reduce Irish foreign policy to the test of whether we are for or against when we threaten to use military action.  It is implied that if we fail this test we should not expect US support in our attempt to gain a seat on the UN Security Council. It is important to emphasise that the individual in question has retired and was not expressing US foreign policy but at the same time his views reflect an attitude which oversimplifies complex issues.</P>
    <P>The kernel of this question concerns the shrinking of the realm of diplomatic capacity.  I say this by way of preface to what I have to say because the public belief in the capacity of the international community to give adequate protection to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo is extremely limited.  In fact, people have been taking the experience of Bosnia-Herzegovina and saying that as that model of a weak and late international initiative is there for all to see, is this all that is on offer now?  They list further and real questions such as, what is the status of the crimes against humanity accusation which has been made against President Molosevic?  Is this still extant or has it been set aside on foot of an agreement which is far from satisfactory?  They ask, what is the role of force which will be deployed? The Minster's statement is interesting in this regard.  He says, for example, that the role is not one of monitoring but also of verification.  Verification is left rather bald in the statement.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to whether such a force will have the right to deliver such circumstances as are necessary to enable refugees to return in security.  The refugees have through their spokespersons made it very clear that to be put back in a situation where those who were perpetrators of crimes against them &mdash; where 500 villages have been destroyed and 500,000 people have been displaced &mdash; will invigilate over their return would not be acceptable.  The spokespersons for the people who have been driven from their homes, and against whom such appalling violence has been visited in Kosovo, have raised questions as to how active the force that will be deployed can be.  How does the Minister's term &ldquo;verification&rdquo; address the reasonable criticism that what has been forced out of President Milosovic at this stage is what was asked of him six months ago? Even if the potential of a military strike is kept in readiness to act as a type of guarantor for the six months deal delivered late, what confidence can the refugees have in it?</P>
    <P>A further issue, and one on which this House would have welcomed more assurance, is the ability of humanitarian aid to get to the people who need it, unmediated by the actions and approval of the person who created all the human <Col N="596" /> circumstances which have given rise to the need for the aid in the first place.  Another aspect of the issue of human aid is how quickly it can be delivered before the winter.  I agree with the Deputy who said that weeks and even a month is a very long time in terms of the danger that exists, but even more important is the question of the aid being given without any sanction against the person who has been responsible for the great human distress towards which the aid is directed.</P>
    <P>Those who speak for the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo suggest there is nothing capable of being spoken about other than independence, and that it is a waste of time to speak about forms of political autonomy because autonomy is a fragile existence under the shadow of a dictatorship.  That casts a question over the third principle of the present initiative which is that of constructing a political dialogue.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with an important matter which has concerned me for a long time.  When the situation arose in Bosnia-Herzegovina people in this country said they were appalled by what was happening and they frequently asked politicians what they were doing about it.  They asked if we were in favour of arming those who were not armed, disarming those who were armed or different forms of military action.  If we have reached a point where only military sanction gets results, it is important that we, as parliamentarians, recognise that is close to the death of diplomacy and it is a very low point in terms of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I do not have an absolutist position on how such distinctions have to be revisited in relation to peacekeeping and peacemaking.  It is necessary to be able to intervene because people who have been accused of crimes against humanity stand immune from public opinion.  It would be foolhardy, therefore, to look from a distance at hundreds of thousands of people regularly suffering what have been classified as crimes against humanity while we have faith in words and say that only a military action is required.  Many people, including myself, would have reservations about arriving at what I call the nadir of international relations, where it is only the threat of force that will work.  I acknowledge we are at that point.</P>
    <P>If we accept this agreement, fragile as it is, the international community that identifies with it and the European Union, which will play a role, will have to answer on the statements and evidence that have been provided about the Russian component of previous international observer forces in relation to Bosnia.  It is important to state that there is a sense of frustration among politicians on all sides as to the appropriate action that can be taken.  When we think of the options beyond this temporary agreement that are on offer, what stands in the wings is an armed strike. What will happen if Ireland is called upon to support an armed strike?  Before people go down that road they should bear in mind the impact. Despite all the rhetoric of militarists in the greatest <Col N="597" /> powers in the world, there is no such thing as an intelligent military strike which leaves civilians intact.  It would be a gross lie for anyone in the world to say the strike against Iraq involved the use of smart missiles that chose only military targets.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is important to bear in mind another moral dimension.  I am horrified that an Irish person serving as the co-ordinator for humanitarian relief in Iraq has resigned because his work in delivering medical humanitarian relief and food aid to children has been impeded by the way the sanctions have operated and the consequences for the Iraqi public.  The international community sometimes draws the conclusion that it is the responsibility of the Iraqi people that they have Saddam Hussein in charge and, therefore, they must all suffer indiscriminately.  In terms of existing conflicts, including Kosovo, people have said that we have to be able to deal with the fact that Milosovic is operating like a dictator.  He has been accused of crimes against humanity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the history of the fragile situation that existed in the past between all the different ethnicities and diversities in these areas.  We must find a way in which people can have a peaceful future but it is unhelpful to condemn out of hand all peoples because of leadership.  It is equally true that the tool used by Milosovic in conducting his campaign in Kosovo has been an abuse of nationalism, in the worst sense, and an abuse of ethnicity and the different dimensions used to inculcate fear and milk the consequences &mdash; the down side of everything that has often been alleged against a narrow view.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for whom I have sympathy, meets his fellow Ministers, they have to deal not only with the list of academic differences between people, but with the real fears of people who have had their homes and communities destroyed, members of their families raped and murdered and who now stand on the edge of winter as displaced people.  For several years the people of Kosovo had been relatively ignored by the international community.  It cannot be denied that they were neglected in the Dayton discussions.  Under what circumstances can they have any trust?  I see no other construction from the latest temporary suggestion which has been negotiated other than asking them to go back to the position in which they were before, and to do so under the very shadow of the people who have visited the worst of consequences on them.  I do not have, therefore, the same cautious optimism about the agreement as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We must place this debate into a wider context so we can begin to see a way beyond this.</P>
    <P>I asked for the reform of the United Nations in relation to the Tribunal on Crimes Against Humanity.  Unless we are able to act, calling people guilty of crimes against humanity and then looking on while no attempt is made to deal with such people is singularly nugatory in a moral sense.  To say that if we do anything, it will be in <Col N="598" /> such a way as to impact on the civilians who have to suffer such people is the same.  It must be dealt with in terms of new initiatives by the international community.  It is dislodging the international community's capacity to restore confidence in the UN and in the international rule of law and diplomacy if we retreat to the idea that there is a single power in the world which can function as international policeman in substitution for what might have been &mdash; international consensus and norms derived through law and diplomacy.  It is not easy to say this.  In a way it is a long confession of certain ways in which the European Union is impotent.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well and I welcome the agreement because it is important.  Let us remember that some of the opponents of this agreement have suggested that hostages are being put in place on the ground.  They are asking what happens if it all goes wrong and we have to remove them and what mechanism exists for getting the hostages out of the way to take the action which was previously deferred.  That is the logic with which we are dealing.  However, if it is fragile, temporary and asking an extraordinary act of trust from those most affected, it is at the same time all we have.  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs has undertaken to report back and make further statements from his discussions in the European Union as to how the situation progresses.</P>
    <P>The most urgent immediate need is aid.  The amount of aid we have pledged is very small by comparison to the need for it.  We must move this aid quickly and in an unconditional fashion to those who most need it.</P>

      <P>When arrangements were originally made for this debate last week, it looked as if the House would be discussing a significantly worsened situation in Kosovo and Serbia in the aftermath of NATO airstrikes and the inevitable casualties which would have followed. Luckily common sense has prevailed, NATO and Milosevic have pulled back from the brink and an opportunity has been presented to try to secure a peaceful solution to the problems of the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US envoy, Richard Holbrooke, is entitled to full credit for persisting with the talks during the past week when things looked very bleak and it seemed that agreement was beyond reach.  It seemed that some elements of NATO were itching for the opportunity to unleash the B52s and the cruise missiles.  Military attacks in this situation, especially without the specific sanction of the United Nations, would have been a serious misjudgment.  It would have reopened Cold War divisions between Russia and the West and increased tensions in the Balkans.  It would in all probability have strengthened the political position of Milosevic, a person who is imbued with the most malignant form of nationalism.  It would have done nothing for the humanitarian needs of the people of Kosovo and, based on similar experiences in the past, it would have almost certainly <Col N="599" /> led to the death and mutilation of entirely innocent people.</P>
    <P>Everyone acknowledges that the deal brokered by Mr. Holbrooke is not a permanent solution but hopefully it will bring an end to the immediate conflict and provide a period when a more lasting solution can be pursued.  The priority must now be the humanitarian needs of the people of Kosovo who face appalling conditions in the harsh winter which is just weeks away.  There are hundreds of thousands of refugees who must be facilitated in returning to their homes, many of which have been destroyed or damaged and need reconstruction.  A supply chain must be established for food and medical needs.  This will be an expensive operation and Ireland must make a contribution to this effort.  I welcome the indication by the Minister in his address that some help will be forthcoming in that area.  I hope that those countries which have already spent tens of millions of pounds in anticipation of military strikes and which were prepared to spend perhaps hundreds of millions in carrying them out will now be willing to commit similar sums of money to meet the humanitarian needs of the people of Kosovo.</P>
    <P>I welcome the central role being given to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe in verifying the agreement and I hope that Ireland will be involved in providing personnel for the proposed 2,000 strong force to monitor developments in Kosovo.  The Minister indicated that he was having discussions with his Government colleagues on how they might assist but he did not indicate whether personnel would be provided.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that the OSCE had considerable potential to help resolve conflicts like this and I regret that it has not been used more often. With 55 member states it is much more broadly based than either the European Union or NATO and enjoys the advantage of including within its numbers countries which were on opposing sides in the Cold War, as well as neutral countries like Ireland.  In fairness, Ireland has pushed for greater use of the OSCE and I hope that we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the OSCE team will face a difficult task in verifying the implementation of this agreement.  The agreement in general meets the requirement of the United Nations Security Resolution of 23 September, providing as it does for early elections, a reduction in the military forces, an amnesty for those who had opposed Serbian forces and a restructuring of the local police force to reflect the ethnic composition of the local population.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the agreement falls short of the aspirations of many Kosovars, particularly the Kosovo Liberation Army, many of whom want full independence.  Others make no secret of their ultimate aim of the creation of a greater Albania. However, significant autonomy is all that is realistically achievable given the geopolitical ramifications of full independence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="600" /> We must remember that while Milosevic and his troops have been guilty of acts of barbarism against the people of Kosovo, the KLA has also been guilty of horrific acts of terrorism.  As one Irish official who served with the UN remarked, there are no boy scouts in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Tito for all his faults recognised that a state like Yugoslavia could only be held together if considerable autonomy was given to its disparate parts.  Kosovo was given considerable autonomy in the revised Yugoslav constitution of 1974, allowing Albanian language schools, the observance of Islamic holy days and representation in the old collective federal presidency.  Unfortunately, in his lust for power in the post-Tito era, Milosevic stirred up ethnic tension and in the case of Kosovo took away the province's autonomous status in 1989, sent in huge numbers of Serbian troops and police, withdrew the status of Albanian as an official language and changed the school curriculum.</P>
    <P>In their declaration after the Cardiff summit last June, EU leaders stated in relation to Kosovo, &ldquo;The European Union remains firmly opposed to independence.  It continues to support a special status including a large degree of autonomy for Kosovo within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&rdquo; That in my view is a reasonable position and one which I would support.  Full independence for Kosovo might set off a chain of events which could have consequences for not just what is left of Yugoslavia, but also for surrounding countries such as Macedonia, Greece, Turkey and Albania.  We must therefore ensure that the Holbrooke agreement works, that real and meaningful autonomy is granted, that the religious and cultural traditions of the people of Kosovo are respected, that their human rights are fully respected and that adequate resources are made available for relief and reconstruction.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the break-up of Yugoslavia has not been a positive development for Europe or the Balkans.  Speaking in the Dáil on 12 July 1991, on a motion approving the sending of a monitor mission to Yugoslavia, I warned that &ldquo;the disintegration of Yugoslavia could set off a chain of events leading to the emergence of a large number of states with conflicting territorial disputes and potentially explosive ethnic disputes.&rdquo; These words proved unfortunately to be prophetic and the last seven years have seen probably the worst ethnic and inter-communal violence Europe has experienced since the Second World War.  The complex, political and regional structures established by Tito were allowed to crumble and ethnic tensions which had lain dormant since the Second World War were allowed to bubble to the surface with disastrous results.  The conflict in Kosovo is the latest manifestation of this and it may not be the last.</P>
    <P>The decision of the German Government in 1991 to recognise the declarations of independence made by Slovenia and Croatia were premature and while it may have been done for what seemed to the Germans to be the best of reasons, <Col N="601" /> it effectively marked the death of Yugoslavia and set off the chain of events which have led to so much death and destruction.  We are still coping with the consequences of these events.</P>
    <P>What we should have learned from the past decade in Yugoslavia and from our own history in the past 30 years is that nationalism can be a corrosive and destructive force especially when symbols, flags, rituals or names are allowed take precedence over the lives of human beings.  In Northern Ireland people's political views can be identified by whether one says Derry or Londonderry. The same is true in Kosovo.  Yet what difference does it make to the lives of ordinary people if they live in Derry or Londonderry or in Kosovo or Kosova?</P>
    <P>We need to move beyond nationalism.  Traditional enemies such as Germany and France are the closest of colleagues in the EU but in much of eastern and central Europe the divisions are as deep as ever and constantly threaten to spill over to violent conflict.</P>
    <P>On our own island the continuing conflict around Drumcree shows that despite the British-Irish Agreement, the legacy of bitterness and hatred have yet to be overcome.  We need to look at a new European collective security system where ethnic minorities, oppressed groups, the economically dispossessed do not have to resort to arms and fundamentalism, based on culture, religion or ethnicity, to have their security protected. The OSCE can play a significant role in this regard particularly if it can successfully carry out the tasks assigned to it in Kosovo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief as Deputies Higgins and De Rossa have referred to many of the issues I intended to address.  On behalf of the Green Party we welcome the deal struck between Mr. Holbrooke and Mr. Milosevic.  It is appropriate that the observers being sent to monitor the agreement will be under the auspices of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe which includes all European states and will be seen as impartial.</P>
      <P>Given Milosevic's record in constantly testing out the resolve of the international community, it is important that the observers are given every resource necessary to effectively monitor the situation. The main weakness of the agreement is that Kosovo remains part of Yugoslavia and, clearly, that is not what 90 per cent of the population want.  Their view will never be supported by the main powers in Europe because most have regions that want independence.  If they support independence for Kosovo, awkward questions will be asked in Corsica, the Basque region and Chechnya.  This matter was raised by Deputy De Rossa when he referred to the geopolitical ramifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ask why the Kosovo crisis was allowed develop to the brink of military action. Should the international community have imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia as soon as the recent offensive by the Yugoslav army began?  It <Col N="602" /> was not until we had evidence of massacres that the world's governments reacted.  By then it was probably too late for sanctions and military action was threatened.</P>
    <P>Once again the limitations of the UN have been exposed.  The primary problem for that organisation is that a veto can be exercised by the US, Russia, China, France and the UK.  It is hypocritical of the US to complain about UN impotence but still insist on holding on to the veto.  The reality is that it wants the UN to be weak so that NATO can have an excuse to throw its weight around.  If NATO is genuinely concerned about governments launching offensives against civilian populations, what about one of its own members, Turkey?  Turkey has been doing to the Kurds for decades what Yugoslavia is doing to the Kosovars and the US has no qualms about supplying Turkey with all the weapons it needs to do this.  Turkey has even launched assaults across the Iraqi border into an area under UN protection but has earned no more than a slap on the wrist.</P>
    <P>Ireland should have nothing to do with NATO while that organisation engages in such outrageous double standards.  Until the main powers adopt a consistent stand on world events and give the UN the power it needs to act effectively, and at an early stage in the crisis, atrocities will continue to happen.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are flaws in the agreement and these have been referred to by those lobbying on behalf of the Kosovars.  The Kosovars will remain under the control of the Serbian police which, in effect, will continue a rule of terror.  The reduction of Serb forces to pre-March levels means a highly armed force will maintain a type of martial law.  Also the role of the OSCE monitors will be restricted to observing events on the ground, with a policing role restricted to aerial surveillance by NATO.</P>
    <P>Amnesty has made a number of important recommendations.  The House should listen closely to what that organisation has to say on the crisis.  It is pressing, as I have done previously, for adequately resourced human rights monitors with a clear mandate, independent of any political process, to be part of any international presence in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to provide information about and access to detainees from Kosovo who are at risk of torture and ill-treatment and information about the disappeared.  We need long-term measures such as the retaining and structuring of the police and establishment of effective national human rights institutions.</P>
    <P>I was in Yugoslavia when Tito died.  I recall vividly an individual saying to me that would be the end of Yugoslavia.  He predicted the terrible bloody consequences which we are seeing today. The Balkan region is extremely volatile and all democracies in Europe will need to keep a close eye on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I express appreciation for the views put forward by Members on the extremely important issues of Kosovo.  Everybody in the Chamber shares the view that the events in Kosovo in recent weeks have passed beyond the threshold of what can be tolerated.  They represent a challenge and an affront to the values of democracy which are shared by states throughout Europe, including the EU, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe &mdash; all organisations to which the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia aspired to membership.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached this week provides an opportunity for all those directly involved &mdash; the authorities in Belgrade, the Kosovo-Albanian leadership, as well as the international community &mdash; to break the vicious circle that has led to the present appalling situation and to build on the foundation of a political settlement to the problems of Kosovo that will be in accordance with the principles on which our international system is based.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the Government's readiness to ensure Ireland contributes to the efforts needed to bring about the desired result.  In his opening statement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to our willingness to contribute to the new verification mission, to the extent that this is feasible.  He also reiterated our commitment to provide substantial humanitarian aid to those in need.  This will be a major issue in the weeks and months ahead.  These needs are immediate and the Government will move rapidly to ensure there is an effective response.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to some specific points raised by Deputies in the area of humanitarian aid, the need for effective co-operative security measures and some of the shortcomings of the agreement. Deputy Durkan referred to the need to prosecute war crimes.  Ireland, in common with our EU partners, takes the view that Yugoslavia must cooperate fully with the UN effort to pursue and indict war criminals.  As Bosnia has shown, this is a difficult area and, unfortunately, progress can be slow.  However, there has been progress in tracking down indictees in Bosnia and the international community will insist on concrete progress also in relation to Kosovo.</P>
      <P>In his report to the Security Council on Kosovo, the UN Secretary General stated that the great majority of atrocities have been committed by Yugoslavia's security forces.  The Secretary General reported that there was good reason to believe that Kosovan Albanian military units have also, regrettably, committed atrocities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse the Secretary General's view that all involved in the killing and mistreatment of civilians must be brought to justice.  This is a clear demand of Resolution 1199, which must be complied with.  The resolution demands that unimpeded access be given to the monitoring and verification mission, so that it can assist in the effort to deliver humanitarian aid directly and unimpeded, <Col N="604" /> without intermediaries other than aid workers.  It must be recalled that the Holbrook-Molosevic agreement is designed to get compliance with the resolution.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs made clear in his opening statement, we are already contributing substantial amounts through UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the EU humanitarian office to help Kosovan refugees.  The immediate need is to help those living out of doors or in makeshift accommodation, either in Kosovo itself or some of the neighbouring countries.  The Government will consider what additional assistance may be needed.  We must ensure the verification committee can do its work.</P>
    <P>What we have seen in the approach of the international community to dealing with the issues of the western Balkans is the need to maximise the influence which can be brought to bear, not just be one organisation but a number of bodies acting in concert.  The EU has played and continues to play a key role, both in the contact group of countries which is co-ordinating the international response, and through its own policies, which are designed to make possible self-sustaining democracy in Bosnia and the restoration of Kosovo's autonomous status.</P>
    <P>The lesson for us will be to see whether the combination of influences, which were initially used successfully in the Dayton agreement, can be similarly used in the future to ensure the necessary results are obtained.  It would have been much better if President Molosevic had got the message six months ago, or if enhanced EU methods on their own had achieved the desired outcome.  However, the deployment of maximum pressure has avoided the need to carry out enforcement actions such as air strikes.  If we are interested in saving lives in situations such as has arisen in Kosovo, we will have to look at ways to improve co-operation and mutually reinforce synergies among the international organisations concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to refer to last night's &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on RTE, which concerned some of those who received Irish citizenship and passports under the <Col N="605" /> ill-fated &ldquo;passports for sale&rdquo; scheme.  What some of these people have done with their citizenship is summed up in the title of the programme &mdash;&ldquo;Passports for Plunder&rdquo;.  While the principle of this scheme may have been fine in theory, in practice its operation has been a disgrace to the good name of the country and its public administration.</P>
      <P>The names of some of the beneficiaries cast a cloud over our reputation.  Sheikh Mafouz, who received not just one but 11 passports for his commitment to Ireland and things Gaelic, has been indicted in respect of the BCCI banking fraud and is a wanted man around the world.  The fraud amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars and may have been the greatest banking fraud in world financial history.  Mr. Charles Wacker was involved in a huge tax fraud in Chicago.  A Chinese gentleman, Mr. Ding Man, got no less than 22 passports for his investment &mdash; how many of those 22 people were even once in Ireland?</P>
      <P>Last night we heard in some detail about Mr. Viktor Kozeny, a disreputable Czech with a KGB background who was fined the maximum amount for illegal share dealing in the Czech Republic and was involved in buying state secrets from a former spy.  He is reputed to have made a profit of about $1 billion by complex deals and privatisation vouchers in the Czech Republic at the expense of ordinary, vulnerable people.  With his Irish passport, he is now engaged in similar activities in Azerbaijan.</P>
      <P>Michael Ding Man, who was mentioned in the programme, was Kozeny's partner in these dealings, and there is strong circumstantial evidence that he was the real architect of it and a major beneficiary also.  To have naturalised Kozeny might be considered a misfortune, but to have granted a passport to Ding Man also must be considered downright carelessness, especially when Ding Man was given his passport in 1996, approximately one year after Kozeny received his.  It is particularly galling because Ding Man is now involved with Vladimir Potanin, one of the more dangerous oligarchs in Russia, in connection with the notorious Uneximbank and, since he has already given up his United States citizenship for a tax efficient Bahamian passport, an Irish passport is vital to him if he wants to be free to jet around the world doing dodgy deals.</P>
      <P>Perhaps as many as half of the 156 naturalisations and passports given out under this scheme have been given to unsuitable and improper people who have not fulfilled the necessary conditions. My question to the Minister now is will he withdraw those passports and cancel the naturalisations in the case of all these various people who are involved in financial and other improprieties, or is Ireland to continue to offer these people its protection and the protection of its good name indefinitely?</P>
      <P>Why should ordinary Irish citizens and their reputation suffer because certain Ministers decided to give these gangsters Irish citizenship in return for questionable investments that may or may not have taken place?</P>

Business was not due to finish until 5.00 p.m. but ended at 4.35 p.m. No discourtesy was <Col N="608" /> intended on my part.  It did not come to my notice until I saw Deputy O'Malley on the monitor in the Department and I left immediately.</P>
      <P>In responding to the matter raised by Deputy O'Malley on the Adjournment, I point out that the matters dealt with in last night's programme long pre-date my term of office and that of the Government.  Deputy Owen, my predecessor, participated in the programme, and she explained her actions.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley will be aware that the investment-based naturalisation scheme emanated from a proposal by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, Deputy John Bruton.  The investment-based naturalisation scheme evolved in the 1980s to assist the IDA in attracting inward investment, especially in manufacturing industry. In the period 1988-94, 66 investors plus 39 spouses and children were naturalised.  During this period the range of investment made under this scheme widened from industrial development to include, for example, some property and forestry development and the shipping sector.  Terms of reference were introduced in 1994 by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and have been followed since.  The main provisions of these terms of reference are the investment of £1 million per applicant, the purchase of a substantial residence and its retention in ownership for at least five years, provision of an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the two years following naturalisation, and provision of a police certificate of character by the authorities of the country of origin.</P>
      <P>Other requirements in the terms of reference related to procedures for verifying the investment and conditions associated with the related naturalisation.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice of Ministers to accept applications for naturalisation of spouses and minor children of investors once an interval has elapsed following the investor's naturalisation.</P>
      <P>In the period 1994 to 1997, 29 investors &mdash; plus nine spouses and children &mdash; were naturalised based on these guidelines.  All of these cases were in progress prior to my taking up office.</P>
      <P>The Government abolished the scheme on 20 April last at my instigation and cleared the way for finalising outstanding cases on hand which are being dealt with in accordance with existing procedures. As Deputy O'Malley is aware no new applications are being accepted following upon that decision of the Government on 20 April. When the Government abolished the investment-based scheme, it decided that I should consider how the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act could facilitate investment and I established a review group to consider this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to comment on last night's programme, which I viewed a short time ago.  I have asked my Department to examine its contents very carefully and I am asking the review group to which I referred to take account of the programme in its deliberations.  Naturally, I will also be asking the review group and the Department <Col N="609" /> to take very careful note of what Deputy O'Malley has had to say in the House today regarding this matter, which I view very seriously.</P>
    <P>On the question of revocation of a certificate of naturalisation, section 19 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, provides that a certificate of naturalisation can be revoked in certain defined circumstances.  These include circumstances where the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud or misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent, concealment of material facts or circumstances, or where the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
    <P>I have the option of considering any case in the light of this section and in that respect I will be considering the information disclosed in last night's programme &mdash; and what Deputy O'Malley had to say here today &mdash; to see what action if any is open to me.  I assure the House that I will not hesitate to take whatever action is required and available to me.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House for this debate.  The long-running problem of the parking of heavy goods vehicles has been a source of much annoyance and anger for residents and residents' association for many years.  Trucks parked in residential areas are unsightly, cause traffic hazards, attract anti-social activity and provide cover for muggings, including handbag snatching.  This issue has been a matter of grave concern to Dublin City councillors in particular because, while this is not solely an urban issue, it primarily affects the Dublin city area.</P>
      <P>After much toing and froing over recent years between the four Dublin local authorities, councillors were told the delay in implementing a ban on parking heavy goods vehicles was as a result of problems the Garda had encountered.  We waited and posed several questions to the Minister, but several Adjournment debates later we still find ourselves no nearer to resolving the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought a solution had been found last October when new regulations came into force from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Under Article 38 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, provision is made for prohibiting the parking of large vehicles in areas where the relevant traffic signs and information plates are erected.  Under the regulations, the signs and information plates must be erected at the entrance to these areas <Col N="610" /> and a further sign and plate must be erected indicating where the prohibition ends.  If the ban is widely implemented it will mean we will have a proliferation of signs and plates all over the city.</P>
    <P>At present, many residents' associations are seeking such a ban in their areas.  Under the 1997 regulations the legal advice available to Dublin Corporation is that it must erect a very ugly three foot high sign &mdash; which costs approximately £3,000 to produce &mdash; at the start and end of whatever area wants the ban.  That can mean an entire housing estate or individual roads.  I am sure the Minister will agree it would be totally unacceptable and ludicrous if practically every residential street in the Dublin city area was to have one of these big signs at the start and end of it.  Clearly, this is not possible.  We cannot continue in this way, yet Dublin Corporation's legal advice is that the only way we can impose a ban is by erecting these signs under the 1997 regulations.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to amend those regulations as a matter of urgency in order to allow Dublin Corporation to impose a blanket ban on the entire city, which is what residents want.  Both the public and councillors of all parties on the corporation want to be able to impose a blanket ban on the parking of heavy goods vehicles in all residential areas.  Certain designated areas could then be exempted for parking, such as industrial estates where such parking would not cause a problem.</P>
    <P>This is a long-running issue and has been a source of much annoyance.  It is exasperating for public representatives to try to explain why they cannot simply introduce a blanket ban on the parking of heavy goods vehicles in residential areas.  I do not understand why we cannot do it because smoky fuel was banned with the stroke of a pen and this environmental problem is just as serious.  It is also a security problem because of the many anti-social problems associated with areas where heavy goods vehicles are parked.  I appeal to the Minister of State to urgently amend the regulations to allow Dublin Corporation to introduced such a blanket ban.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this issue.  The role of local authorities in relation to the management of traffic and parking in their functional areas was greatly enhanced under the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The Act provides a modern framework for the application of the laws relating to traffic and parking and gives full discretion to local authorities, subject only to consultation with the Garda, to put in place traffic management measures which they consider appropriate.  In addition, the Act granted local authorities maximum flexibility in relation to the provision of traffic calming measures and speed limits.</P>

    <P>The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, 1997, which were made under section 35 of the Act and came into operation on 1 October 1997, provided for the first time a single comprehensive <Col N="611" /> and streamlined set of rules governing traffic and parking.  Decisions in relation to the application of the controls set out in those regulations are a matter for local authorities.</P>
    <P>The regulations provide local authorities with a number of means of controlling parking in their areas to cover various circumstances.  These include, for example, the provision of double yellow lines, single yellow lines, clearways, disabled persons parking bays, and prohibitions on parking a school entrances.  All such parking controls are applied by the provision of appropriate signs and road markings.</P>
    <P>The regulations also provided for the first time for the application of a restriction on parking large vehicles.  This restriction is applied by the provision of appropriate traffic signs placed at the entrance to the road or area in respect of which it is to be applied.  The regulations also provide for the use of signs to indicate the end of the restriction.  A vehicle which exceeds the weight indicated on the sign may not park in the area except for the purpose of loading or unloading for a maximum period of 30 minutes.  The determination of the areas and the extent of the application of the restriction are matters for the individual local authorities who are best placed to give full consideration to all of the issues which arise.  This provision was included in the 1997 regulations following a considerable amount of representation to my Department and following consultation with the Garda and a number of local authorities, including Dublin and Cork Corporations.</P>
    <P>The case is now apparently being made that it should be feasible for a local authority to place a blanket prohibition on parking heavy goods vehicles within its area without the need for a detailed assessment of the justification for this approach in relation to particular roads or neighbourhoods. This blanket approach could have serious economic and disruptive consequences for certain transport operators.  I would wish to see it carefully justified and substantiated in the context of a review of other potential truck enforcement strategies, before contemplating a change in the present regulations.</P>
    <P>My Department remains open to proposals for improving regulations generally.  In fairness to all interests concerned, it is right that major changes should not be instigated without a thorough and transparent analysis of the issues involved.  I assure the Deputy that I will review the position to see what changes might be implemented at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rathfredagh Cheshire Home in Newcastlewest was established in 1971. Over the years, it has been highly respected because of the level of care and the commitment of the staff.  The residents are primarily those with <Col N="612" /> multiple sclerosis, car accident injuries and those who have been disabled since birth.  There are 28 residents in total with an additional two places for respite care with a potential for further places. The 35 staff, most of whom work part-time and who have worked there over many years, have had to put up with salary scales and premiums which are seriously deficient compared to staff working within the health board.</P>
      <P>I am aware the Mid-Western Health Board has approached the Department of Health and Children to provide additional funding.  In 1997 the board agreed to enhance the salaries and premiums over a three year period.  In 1997 £20,000 for a half year was provided.  In 1998 the Mid-Western Health Board's costs will be £56,000.  It has allocated £40,000 and there is a shortfall of £16,000.  In 1999 and 2000 Mid-Western Health Board budgets, £40,000 has been allocated for each, but there will still be a shortfall of £64,000 and £94,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>The objective of the phased agreement over three years was to ensure the staff would be paid at the correct point of the scale with appropriate premium payments.  It is vital the Department of Health and Children ensures the appropriate financial allocation is made to the Mid-Western Health Board.  It must be ensured that the staff at Rathfredagh Cheshire Home are fully recognised for the great work they do.  It is now a matter of urgency that the Department of Health and Children provides the funding and I call on the Minister to ensure this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to clarify the position about the funding of Rathfredagh Cheshire Home.</P>
      <P>Neither my Department nor any health board has any responsibility for negotiating the salaries and conditions of service of the staff of any agency, such as Rathfredagh Cheshire Home, in the voluntary sector.  This is strictly a matter for the agency as employer.  That said, the position is that health boards in accordance with section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, pay annual grants towards the running costs of such agencies. Section 65 provides that a health board may give assistance to any body which provides a service similar or ancillary to a service which the board may provide by, <i>inter alia</i>, contributing to the expenses incurred by the body.  The wording of the provision makes it clear that it was not the intention of the legislators that the grant must cover all the expenses incurred by the body in providing the service.  What was intended was a contribution towards such costs.  In most cases, agencies in the voluntary sector cover a proportion of their costs from fund-raising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay costs of staff are an element &mdash; in most cases the principal element &mdash; in the running costs of any body.  As such, it is taken into account by a health board in negotiations with the body on the level of the section 65 grant.  I am aware that detailed discussions have taken place in this context <Col N="613" /> between the Mid-Western Health Board and the home, as to the need to increase pay rates and provide pensions and the cost of doing so.</P>
    <P>The grant to Rathfredagh is currently £359,500. This includes an increase of £12,000 in 1998 out of additional funding made available for services for physical and sensory disability.  In addition, the Mid-Western Health Board made available out of its own resources an additional £25,000 in 1997 and £25,000 again in 1998.  In all, the home has had its annual section 65 grant from the health board increased by about 40 per cent in the past two years.  The Deputy will agree this is a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Mid-Western Health Board is in constant touch with Rathfredagh Cheshire Home regarding its financial problems and will continue to keep its annual grant to the home under review with a view to providing an enhanced contribution to the home's running expenses as resources permit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, was in Opposition, he reprimanded the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, on 4 December 1996 for not attending Adjournment debates and accused her of having a high disregard for the House.  This is the second time I have raised this issue on the Adjournment and on neither occasion has the Minister, Deputy Martin, seen fit to answer it himself.  He has clearly changed his attitude to the House in the meantime.  It is not the only thing. In the same debate on 4 December 1996, he said no one would begrudge additional teachers to schools in the Breaking the Cycle scheme.  He said they deserve all the help they can get.  Now he is not only not giving these schools additional help, he is taking what they have from them and undermining them.  He has certainly changed in the past two years.</P>
      <P>I will refer in detail to the two schools because of the misleading information disseminated from official sources in recent months.  The Central Model School, of which the Minister is patron, is in his back yard in Marlborough Street.  The children attending it are some of the most disadvantaged in the State, coming largely from the Seán McDermott Street area.  There are 27 children in second class with two teachers under Breaking the Cycle guidelines.  There are 19 in third and fourth class, 23 in fifth, 19 in sixth and a special class of ten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is that it now has one less teacher. What can it do?  The obvious thing is to double the classes but that would mean one teacher with 38 children in the circumstances I have outlined. The Department's answer to the school is interesting.  It told it to lump together all the children from the four educational levels and divide by three, which would leave approximately 27 children in each class.  This ham fisted approach would have a disastrous impact on the educational <Col N="614" /> progress of children already settled and working well in fixed classes with their own work programmes, and especially on the sixth class of 19 children.  The school rightly refuses to disrupt this class and undo the progress achieved so far.</P>
    <P>The Department's attitude seems to be uncaring and ignores the simple fact that the school does not have three classrooms physically large enough for 27 children in each room.  In addition, the principal also teaches 23 fifth class pupils.  The Department seems to believe he can cope with a further five children from different classes, run the school and teach a class comprising 27 children of varying educational levels in one of the most disadvantaged communities in the State. That is outrageous.  Either the Minister is not familiar with the implications of the loss of a teacher to this school or he does not care.</P>
    <P>At a time when the school was beginning to make real progress with the children under the Breaking the Cycle initiative, the Minister has dashed its hopes.  We have returned to a situation where the children have no real opportunities. The Minister, like his predecessors, is patron of the school.  How many children from this school have progressed to second or third level education during the past ten years?  I ask the Minister to obtain this information if he is interested. After all, he is the patron.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to Scoil Plás Mhuire, a boy's national school in Dorset Street, which educates children from Dublin's north inner city and which was selected for the Breaking the Cycle project as the most disadvantaged of disadvantaged schools in the State.  The case for the school can be put simply.  This week there are 108 children in the school while last year there were only 100. However, the school is obliged to cope without the services of one of its teachers.  This cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week the Minister argued his position armed with inaccurate information. He stated there are 12 children in junior infants in the school whereas there are actually 17 because the school took in five additional students.  This means the Department is now in breach of the guidelines laid down for the Breaking the Cycle project, under which classes should contain a maximum of 15 children.  The principal of School Plás Mhuire also teaches a class.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach to these schools is clearly undermining the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  Both are situated in a heroin blackspot in the north inner city drugs task force area.  The Minister's policy of removing desperately needed teachers from local schools will inevitably result in placing even more 13 and 14 year olds on the streets.  I say this despite his announcement yesterday &mdash; a superficial PR exercise &mdash; that he intends to extend the school leaving age to 16.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the north inner city is the area with the lowest level of access to third level education in the State.  The Department of Education and Science has consistently failed in its responsibilities to the children of this area.  The Breaking <Col N="615" /> the Cycle initiative was a step in the right direction but the loss of these teachers is a serious blow to the progress that has been made.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this decision and to find some mechanism to appoint temporary teachers to each of these schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the non-attendance of the Minister for Education and Science who is unavoidably absent.  I am sure he would rather be present to reply to the Deputy's points but that is not always possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will already be aware that the staffing of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then.  While the Minister is mindful of the fact that the schools in question serve communities which have many problems, the facts are that the overall staffing level at the schools is, in relative terms, quite good.  Therefore, he cannot authorise the retention of previous staffing levels at the schools.</P>
      <P>Scoil Plás Mhuire and Central Model senior national school, as the Deputy is aware, are two of the 33 urban schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project which was introduced in 1996.  One of the main elements of the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle was the implementation of a 15:1 pupil-teacher ratio in the junior classes of all schools included in the project.  Since the introduction of the project, all the selected schools have been allocated sufficient staffing resources to ensure a maximum class size of 15 pupils applies in all junior classes. The allocation of teaching resources to schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle project is also determined by reference to the school's enrolment on 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enrolment of Scoil Plás Mhuire on 30 September 1997 was 100 pupils.  An enrolment of 100 warrants a staffing complement of one principal and three teachers.  However, in addition to this <Col N="616" /> staffing, the school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a full-time disadvantaged concessionary teacher, a shared home-school liaison teacher and an amalgamated concessionary teacher.  A member of the Department's inspectorate recently visited Scoil Plás Mhuire and reported that the school currently has an enrolment of 106 pupils.</P>
    <P>The enrolment of Central Model senior national school on 30 September 1997 was 108 pupils.  An enrolment of 108 warrants a staffing complement of one principal and three teachers. However, in addition to this staffing, the school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a shared remedial teacher, a full-time disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home-school liaison teacher, a shared teaching counsellor and a special additional assistant.  A member of the Department's inspectorate also recently visited Central Model Senior National School and reported that the school currently has an enrolment of 116 pupils.</P>
    <P>Even though Scoil Plás Mhuire and Central Model senior national school have experienced a slight increase in enrolments for the current school year, this does not warrant the appointment of additional teaching staff in either of the schools.  Both are capable of being managed adequately with their current staffing, within the maximum class size guidelines, including the 15:1 maximum class size guideline for junior classes which applies to schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.  In the circumstances, the staffing levels currently sanctioned to the schools are adequate.</P>

      <P>I believe the Deputy is aware that the National Museum has responsibility for the collection and preservation of artefacts and specimens, not only for display but as scientific archives which are often not suitable or intended for display purposes.  The National Museum will only exhibit at any time a representative sample of the national collections and as more facilities are made available they will be able to exhibit a more extensive range of artefacts and specimens with the remaining material held in storage.  It is the normal international practice of all museums to retain large reserve collections in storage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that until recently the ability of the National Museum to put on display artefacts and specimens in its charge was restricted due to the level of exhibition space available.  However the opening of a major new facility at Collins Barracks in September 1997, in addition to the existing museums at Kildare Street and the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street, have meant that the situation has improved.  Future plans for the National Museum include further developments at Collins Barracks and the opening of a Folklife Museum at Turlough Park House, Castlebar.  These developments will enable the National Museum to put on display a more extensive range of artefacts and specimens from the national collections, some of which have not been seen for a considerable period.  I should also acknowledge the fact that the National Museum <Col N="619" /> lends material for exhibition to other museums, both nationally and abroad.</P>

      <P>In accordance with declarations made by me under the European Communities (Wildlife Act, 1976) (Amendment) Regulations, 1986 (S.  I. No. 254 of 1986), landowners are permitted to control certain wild bird species by designated methods where, for example, crop damage, damage to livestock or spread of animal diseases are involved.  Control of wild birds other than under these declarations must be subject to a specific licence issued under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>In April this year, an application for a licence under section 42 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, which facilitates the control of protected species causing damage to crops or livestock by a pest control company was received by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, in respect of lands adjacent to the Dungarvan landfill site.  This application was supported by correspondence from Waterford County Council verifying the damage and nuisance caused to surrounding farmland from birds attracted to the landfill site. The application was investigated in a site visit by officials of Dúchas on 7 May which confirmed the nature of the problem and the damage caused.  A licence issued under section 42 of the Act to the pest control company on 14 May 1998 enabling them to shoot, scare and use narcotised bait for control of rooks and gulls valid to 30 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The control operation was carried out in May and as part of the operation, the pest control company monitored the operation to ensure that casualties among non-target species were avoided or minimised to the greatest possible extent. While I understand that there may have been some non-target casualties as a result of this operation, my officials have received no complaints in relation to the operation itself and I am satisfied that all reasonable efforts were taken to avoid such casualties.</P>

      <P>However, I have directed Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, to examine the list proposed by the IPCC, to see whether we should at this stage include any additional sites from that list, if such appears justified for the State to comply with its obligations under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>When the Irish list for all habitats is complete that list will be discussed at a biogeographical regional seminar, at which Non-Government Organisations, the European Commission, invited experts and my Department will be represented. The commission will base its judgment on whether our proposals are adequate taking into account the discussions at the seminar among other factors.</P>

      <P>The problem of overgrazing occurs mainly in commonages in western areas where there are high densities of sheep.  The EU Commission has instituted legal proceedings against Ireland because of the damage occurring to natural habitats as a result of overgrazing.  The <Col N="621" /> rural environment protection scheme, operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food, has been amended recently to include new provisions for the conservation of natural heritage areas and commonages.  The revised scheme requires commonage framework plans to be prepared for each commonage; these plans will prescribe sustainable stocking levels for each commonage and specify other conservation measures designed to encourage the vegetation to recover; they will be prepared by approved planners trained and supervised jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Individual commonage shareholders will be required to manage their stocking levels in accordance with the overall framework plan.</P>
      <P>There is a need to apply the measures at an early date and, in order to avoid delays in implementing the measures, both Departments are examining ways of speeding up the process and investigating whether interim measures may be taken to enable farmers with land in an over-grazed commonage to participate earlier in the revised scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures the Department of Agriculture and Food is introducing cross-compliance whereby farmers who fail to reduce their stock levels in accordance with the plans will be ineligible for headage or premia payments, other than when they are operating in accordance with an approved rural environment protection scheme plan or a farm plan prepared by my Department.</P>
      <P>The effect of the measures on the vegetation cover will be monitored to ascertain whether additional reductions are required and if, or when, stock numbers may be increased.  I am confident that all these measures will, when fully implemented, redress the problem of overgrazing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in accordance with the conclusions of the tripartite discussions between my Department, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the National Theatre Society in 1997, the National Theatre Society Limited submitted detailed proposals for a severance package to An Chomhairle Ealaíon earlier this year.  An chomhairle examined the proposal and made a recommendation to my Department.</P>
      <P>The current position is that no additional Exchequer moneys can be made available to provide funding for the proposed package.  The funding of any package the society decides to offer must therefore be examined by the society in the context of its own resources and its annual grant from An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  In this regard I have advised an chomhairle that my Department would be prepared, if requested, to assist in exploring possible funding options within the constraints of existing financial resources.</P>
      <P>The position has been communicated formally to An Chomhairle Ealaíon and was also outlined to the annual general meeting of the National Theatre Society Limited on 26 September by my proxy who attended the meeting on my behalf.</P>

      <P>A total of £18,752,000 has been made available in Vote 42 of my Department in 1998 to help fund various cultural institutions operating under my aegis and some other cultural projects.  The primary breakdown of the amounts allocated are set out in subheads B, C1, C2 and C3 of my Vote under the heading &ldquo;arts and culture&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subhead A provides for pay and administration expenses totalling £5,050,000 for the National Museum, National Library and the National Archives.  Subhead B provides payments to match resources generated by these bodies by way of grant-in-aid.  In 1998 this is estimated to be £850,000.</P>
      <P>Subhead C1 provides general expenses for cited key cultural institutions under my aegis.  In 1998 the amount has been set at £6,034,000.</P>
      <P>Subhead C2 provides for the allocation of grants to other cultural institutions and projects. Under this heading annual grants are made to the Irish Manuscripts Commission, Irish Architectural Archive, Marsh's Library and the Hunt Museum.  Capital moneys required for the equipping of the Chester Beatty Library at Dublin Castle's clock tower are also comprehended under this subhead as is a grant towards the development of a furniture conservation service being established in Letterfrack.  In 1998 the subhead C2 amount has been set at £3,018,000.</P>
      <P>Subhead C3 provides funding for capital projects approved for grant assistance under the cultural development incentives scheme, CDIS, and also the Crawford Municipal Art Gallery.  In 1998 the amount allocated under this heading is £3,800,000.</P>
      <P>The amounts to be allocated under each heading are arrived at following appraisal within my Department of the financial submissions made by each of the institutions and projects involved and in the light of the outcome of the annual budgetary process.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 640 of 30 September 1998, the delay in transmitting a list of SAC sites to the EU Commission arose initially from the fact that the <Col N="625" /> EU Habitats Directive was not transposed into national legislation until February 1997 and, subsequently, because the regulations provide all landowners and land users with an opportunity to object, on scientific grounds, to the inclusion of their lands in special areas of conservation.</P>
      <P>An advisory appeals board, chaired by Mr. Michael Mills, which I have set up to examine scientific objections to the boundaries of these sites, will meet shortly to establish procedures which will be open and transparent.  The board comprises representatives of the farming and conservation organisations and landowners and users.  I regret that there has been a delay in getting the appeals hearings under way due to difficulties which I am attempting to resolve with staff interests in relation to certain organisational matters regarding the appeals process.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I have transmitted initial lists totalling 48 sites, for which no objections were received, to the EU Commission and will transmit other sites as the advisory appeals board completes its review of the objections received.</P>
      <P>Although my Department has not yet complied with the requirement to transmit the list to Brussels, within the time frame set out in the directive, in practice practical and effective conservation is taking place on over 500,000 hectares of land included in the 207 publicly advertised sites and the non-transmission of the list has had no damaging conservation impact on these sites.</P>

      <P>As the Minister with primary responsibility for heritage, I am developing a comprehensive and systematic policy and legislative framework for the protection of the architectural heritage.  A key component of this overall strategy is the implementation of the package of legislative, financial and administrative measures for the protection of the architectural heritage announced by myself and my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government in May 1998.  These measures include the establishment of a new grant-aid scheme for approved conservation works to protected (listed) buildings.  This scheme will commence in 1999, will be administered by local authorities, will have funding of approximately £4m per annum, and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards which are being drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my own <Col N="628" /> Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council. In addition, existing policy initiatives in relation to the architectural heritage will be brought together and further policy areas will be developed in the context of the national heritage plan, the initiation of which I recently announced.</P>
      <P>Houses and castles of architectural and historic interest form a part of the architectural heritage and, where appropriate, issues of maintenance, preservation and public access will be addressed in the context of the foregoing.</P>
      <P>In relation to public access, one of the conditions of tax relief under section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, which provides for full relief from income tax or corporation tax to the owner or occupier of a building of significant historical, architectural or aesthetic interest in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance or restoration of such a building, relates to the provision of public access to the building.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my response to Questions Nos. 3 and 4 of 18 June 1998.</P>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree that a response to a consultative document such as the Green Paper is an &ldquo;action&rdquo; as envisaged under the Article referred to by the Deputy.  However, as I indicated in my earlier reply, my primary concern was to ensure that, in the response by Ireland to the consultative document, the concept of public service broadcasting with its associated elements of universal access and the provision of services which cater to a wide audience is taken into account in any deliberations on this matter.  I am satisfied that the Irish response reflects these concerns and that, given that the role of public service broadcasting systems in the member states, as acknowledged in the Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty reflect their national and regional diversity and, <i>inter alia</i>, the cultural needs of each society in the European Union, the Article has been respected.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since June 1997, I have taken a number of major actions in relation to alleged or possible <Col N="630" /> irregularities in the financial services sector.

      <P>I have seen recent media reportage relating to a report commissioned by the UK Office of Fair Trading into market power and consolidation in British food retailing.  The media reportage referred to the UK.  While concerns stopping short of profiteering were reported, the indications were that the OFT regard the report as unofficial and representing an input into their further investigation into whether such retailers were abusing their market power.  I have received no reports of profiteering by British retail multiples in Ireland.  If complaints in this area were made, I would of course be concerned.</P>
      <P>The law dealing with regulation of competition is different in Ireland.  The Competition Act, 1991, specifically prohibits anti-competitive practices, including price fixing and the abuse of a dominant position.  Under the Act, any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief, by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, contains offences and penalty provisions for breaches of the rules of competition as set out in the 1991 Act.  In addition, it provides for public enforcement of the rules of competition.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has appointed a Director of Competition <Col N="631" /> Enforcement to give effect to the public enforcement provisions.</P>
    <P>As a result of the enactment of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996, there are now two alternative ways of pursuing allegations of breaches of competition rules.  If the Deputy has any evidence of anti-competitive behaviour it is possible to take a civil action under section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991.  Alternatively, a complaint can be lodged with the Director of Competition Enforcement requesting him to investigate the alleged breach(s).  The Director of Competition Enforcement is based at the offices of the Competition Authority, Parnell House, Parnell Square, Dublin 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three key statutory provisions, contained in the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, which govern the removal or rendering harmless of wrecked vessels. Section 51(2) of the Act places a responsibility on the owner of a wreck to remove or render it harmless where it is likely to become an obstruction or danger to navigation or to lifeboats engaged in the lifeboat service, or a threat of harm to the marine environment or related interests, which include fishing and tourist activities, which constitute the means of livelihood for persons concerned, and the tourist attractions of any area concerned.  Section 51(3) of the Act empowers appropriate authorities, which are defined as harbour authorities, local authorities and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, to serve a notice on an owner requiring him or her to remove or render harmless a wreck in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>Under section 52 of the Act, the appropriate authorities also have certain powers to themselves remove or render harmless an offending wreck and to recover the expenses incurred from the relevant person.  The relevant person is defined as the owner of the wreck at the time when it sunk or was wrecked, grounded, stranded or abandoned.  While the powers of harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Irish Lights to remove a wreck arise only where it is likely to be an obstruction or danger to navigation or lifeboats, local authorities &mdash; in this instance Mayo County Council &mdash; have further discretion to act if the wreck constitutes a threat to the marine environment or to related interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have, therefore, no direct role in <Col N="632" /> relation to the removal of the wreck of the trawler in question, there are clear statutory powers and responsibilities contained in the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, which address the removal of wrecked vessels where they pose a threat.  I trust this is of assistance to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>Post traumatic stress disorder was first authoritatively described in the USA in 1980.  At that time, however, it was believed that only stress of exceptionally long duration or severity, such as that encountered in Vietnam, could give rise to the condition.  The condition came to attention in Europe at the end of the 1980s.</P>
      <P>As knowledge increased in this area, it came to be accepted that the condition could also arise from incidents of less duration or severity than had originally been thought.  By 1994 the growing body of knowledge assembled on the subject made it clear that PTSD could arise from situations such as those faced by Irish soldiers in the course of their duties, and in March 1994 procedures were put in place to prevent its occurrence where possible, and to treat it as an entity where it did occur.</P>
      <P>The steps being taken to deal with this problem are twofold.  Support and counselling systems are in place for those who are exposed to stress which may result in PTSD.  Such counselling is believed to reduce the numbers of people who develop PTSD after an incident.  For those who develop PTSD counselling and psychiatric services are offered either within the Army itself or where this is not practicable, patients are referred to the appropriate civilian treatment service.  Currently approximately 20 persons are or have been in treatment for PTSD of varying degrees of severity.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that individuals who in the past presented with symptoms which are now recognised as being related to PTSD, such as anxiety, flashbacks or sleep disturbance, received, at that time, all appropriate medical attention and the support of their peers and commanders.  The Medical Corps continues to monitor developments in this field generally and in particular continually reviews the position with regard to the experience of our own military personnel.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the reorganisation of the area aid unit has resulted in significant progress being made in improving service delivery by the unit this year.  The temporary suspension of the telephone service is due to the volume of calls arising from the unprecedented high level of early headage payments made to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the overall staff resources available to my Department the area aid unit has been an area to which I have attached particular priority given its critical importance in ensuring that the maximum number of payments are made at the earliest possible date.  I am keeping the staffing situation and allocation of other resources under <Col N="636" /> review and can assure the Deputy that wherever possible, my Department will redeploy resources to the area aid unit to meet the needs of the farming community.</P>

      <P>The criteria established to facilitate selection of areas for reclassification as extremely disadvantaged were as follows: (1) the areas must be already designated more severely handicapped, and should not extend beyond the boundary of the original MSH designation of 1975; (2) there must be a high proportion of &ldquo;Rough Grazing&rdquo; land in the areas; (3) the areas must be subject to extreme climatic conditions; (4) to ensure homogeneity of physical characteristics and farming types, areas must be at least 20,000 hectares in extent.</P>
      <P>All potential areas were examined for compliance with these criteria, and proposals were prepared which were formally submitted to the EU Commission on 9 October 1996.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to submission of the proposals, the Commission raised the issues of conservation and overgrazing in connection with the REPS and national heritage areas.  They were concerned to ensure that proposals affecting the extent and classification of land in the disadvantaged areas did not have an adverse effect on areas being targeted by the REPS and NHAs as requiring special attention.  In this regard, the Commission made it clear that discussions relating to overgrazing and conservation had to be concluded before proposals affecting disadvantaged areas could be considered.  These discussions have now been concluded.  As a result, cross-compliance between ewe premium and sheep headage schemes and agri-environmental measures must he introduced in 1999.</P>
      <P>As part of the Agenda 2000 negotiations, discussions have commenced on the future funding of Structural Fund support measures, including headage.  The question of a new category of extremely disadvantaged areas will be examined in the context of these discussions.</P>

      <P>From a welfare perspective I have indicated that, while I am not disposed towards a ban on the sport of fox hunting, there were practices associated with the sport which caused me concern. I conveyed this concern to the bodies which represent organised fox hunting in Ireland.  I was accordingly pleased to note that the Irish Hunting Association, which encompasses such bodies, announced in August last rules and procedures which will apply in particular to the practices of digging out, bolting and earthstopping.  I regard this as a positive development and I have welcomed the fact that the fox hunting bodies have responded to my expressed concern in relation to such practices.</P>
      <P>The rules and procedures will apply to all hunts which are members of the affiliated bodies of the lrish Hunting Association These include the lrish Masters of Foxhounds Association, the Irish Foot Harriers Association and the Irish Masters of Harriers Association.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>In Ireland mammography is used primarily as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or concerned women on referral from their GPs and in some cases for women at particular risk of developing the disease.  Diagnostic mammography services are provided at 19 centres throughout the country, as per the following list.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis. The aim is to lead to earlier detection and treatment of breast cancer in asymptomatic women. In Ireland, experience of breast screening to date derives from a pilot programme, known as the Eccles breast screening programme, which was established in 1989 by the Mater Foundation.  The Eccles programme successfully demonstrated that a mammography screening programme is feasible in an Irish setting.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the National Cancer Strategy.  Included in the plan were proposals for the introduction on a phased basis of a national breast screening programme. Phase I will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas and will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents approximately 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> Following the launch of the cancer action plan, a national steering committee, chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, chief executive officer, Western Health Board, was established to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer.  Since its establishment, there have been a number of key developments. These include: (i) The passage of the Health (Provision of Information) Act, 1997, which facilitated the development of a population register. A population register for the programme has now been compiled.  It is being validated and finetuned and will be operational by the time screening commences.  (ii) The appointment of Dr. Jane Buttimer as project director for the programme, (iii) A decision by the breast screening steering committee on a model of delivery for Phase I of the programme.  It has been agreed that there will be two central units based at the Mater and St. Vincent's, where the screening, assessment and treatment of women will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary team approach involving the relevant clinical disciplines, including the screening radiologist.  There will be two mobile units to bring the screening services to the women in the more remote-rural areas within the three health boards in Phase I. Each mobile unit will be linked with one of the central units.  This should ensure uniformity of standards and continuity of care, (iv) The establishment of the programme as a legal entity to facilitate the appointment of consultant and support staff as well as for budgetary control and financial accountability reasons.  The programme was recently established as a joint board under section 11 of the Health Act, 1970, (v) recent advertisements for consultant and support in the national press, (vi) Preparation of quality assurance guidelines by the National QA Committee, which is a sub-committee of the national steering committee.</P>
    <P>In relation to staff for the national breast screening programme, I can confirm that there will be dedicated consultant and support staff appointed to specifically manage the workload involved in Phase I of the national breast screening programme, in line with best international standards.  Every effort has been made to ensure that the level of staffing will be appropriate to deal with the estimated throughput levels in Phase I of the programme.</P>
    <P>A key determinant regarding the start up date for the programme will be the recruitment of the relevant consultant and support staff, advertisements for which were recently placed in the national press.  Once the relevant staff are ready to take up their appointments we should be in a position to start the programme.</P>
    <P>I am committed to making the necessary resources available to the programme to facilitate the commencement of screening and I have approved funding to date of £2 million to cover the start up costs and minor capital equipment.  I recently approved the following capital allocations: £1,035,000 towards the refurbishment of 36 Eccles Street, Mater Hospital, as a screening <Col N="645" /> and assessment unit and also as headquarters of the programme; and £897,750 towards the construction of screening unit facilities at St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsequent phases of the programme, I will be guided by the experience gained from putting Phase I of the programme in place.</P>

      <P>The consultants on the house price study, Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, recommended a written voluntary code of practice as the most effective means of limiting undesirable practices such as gazumping by some house builders and suggested that the professional representative body of home builders could play a positive role through the introduction of such a code.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the Bacon report and the launch of the Government's <i>Action on House Prices</i>, I raised the question of formulating a code of practice to deal with undesirable market practices with the Irish Home Builders' Association and the response of the association has been very positive.  In addition, my Department is in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform with a view to referring the issue of a possible legislative response to the problem of gazumping to the Law Reform Commission for consideration.</P>

      <P>Protocol dealing with the national flag is covered in the publication, An Bhratach Náisiúnta, published by the Stationery Office.  I understand that some time ago the Department of the Taoiseach asked the Genealogical Office to update the publication.  When the revision is completed it is intended to circulate it widely to public bodies, schools, libraries and other relevant centres.  It is hoped that the revised publication will encourage the flying of the flag more regularly on public buildings and, in the absence of legislation on the subject, ensure its proper display and use.</P>

      <P>In May 1998, I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, announced a comprehensive package of legislative, financial and administrative measures for the protection of the architectural heritage.  The legislative measures include a new Planning Bill, to be brought forward by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, which will give comprehensive protection to buildings and structures of architectural, artistic and historic importance, and a Bill to place the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, which is currently being carried out by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, on a statutory basis.  The latter Bill is currently being finalised and I expect to be able to publish it shortly.</P>
      <P>The National Inventory of Architectural Heritage is a key component of the overall framework for the protection of the architectural heritage, as identification and recording of that heritage is an essential prerequisite for protection.  The inventory will now have an accelerated programme of work, including an immediate interim survey of buildings, to allow it to effectively form the database for the proposed new listed buildings system. I have set a target of 12 years for completion of the inventory.  In advance of the completion of the inventory, it is not possible to quantify the total number of buildings, including houses, and structures of architectural, artistic and historic importance.</P>
      <P>The package of protection measures also includes the establishment of a new grantaid scheme for approved conservation works to protected (listed) buildings.  This scheme will commence in 1999, will be administered by local authorities, will have funding of approximately £4 million per annum, and will be operated in accordance with national criteria and standards to be drawn up by an advisory group made up of representatives of my own Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Heritage Council.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Wildlife Act, 1976, is an Act for the conservation of wildlife, including game, and, to that end, includes provisions to protect certain <Col N="652" /> wild fauna and flora; to enable wildlife reserves and refuges to be established and maintained; to regulate hunting; and to regulate and control wildlife dealing.</P>
      <P>In addition, over 100 special protection areas, SPAs, have to date been designated under the EU Birds Directive (79/409/EEC).  These designations seek to protect bird species and their habitats.  Furthermore, the EU Habitats Directive, which requires the conservation of natural habitats and wildlife species, other than birds, through the designation of special areas of conservation, SACs, was transposed into Irish law on 26 February 1997 by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 94 of 1997).  These regulations provide protection for both SACs and SPAs as important wildlife areas. The process of designating SACs in accordance with the regulations is well under way, in that the main part of what will be Ireland's SAC network, over 200 sites amounting to some 550,000 ha, has already been publicly proposed for designation and is accordingly protected.</P>
      <P>All ecologically important wildlife areas will attract a natural heritage area (NHA) designation, including areas which will not be designated under the EU Directives but are of importance in the national context.  It is intended that formal designation of NHAs will begin when the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been amended.  The position in regard to the proposed Wildlife (Amendment) Bill &mdash; which will improve laws for the protection of wildlife species and their habitats as well as providing statutory protection for NHAs and affording protection for the first time to important geological and geomorphological sites &mdash; is set out in my reply to Question No. 641 of 30 Meán Fómhair 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, has an ongoing wildlife monitoring programme in place which carries out regular surveys on all aspects of our wildlife, both flora and fauna.  Endangered or protected wildlife receive priority under this programme. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have obtained approval to increase the wildlife ranger force by 30 rangers, who are being recruited at present, and to employ other additional staff.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware of notification of decision of Kildare County Council dated 17/09/98 to grant permission for development works at Maynooth Castle subject to certain conditions.  It remains open to third parties to appeal the decision to An Bord Pleanála within a month of that date.  The next phase of the project will be to proceed to tender documentation stage having regard to the planning permission requirements, estimate of cost and funds available.</P>
      <P>The proposed project is to re-roof the keep of Maynooth Castle, for the purpose of preserving and presenting the monument for public access in a form which maintains the landscape setting of the castle ruins, to build additions necessary for the use of the castle for exhibition, assembly, tours and meetings as well as providing services for guides.  Building works will include landscaping and new paving as well as the provision of stairs, toilets and a lift in a new access tower at the north elevation, the erection of a new entrance kiosk and ancillary sewage works.  Particular measures will have to be taken to ensure the full recording of the existing structure and archaeological features which will include a full detailed study of the existing castle and archaeological clearance of areas to be disturbed prior to commencement of works on site.</P>
      <P>Subject to detailed estimates and funding, it is proposed that the first and main phase of the project comprising of works in the castle and access tower, including services, will start on site in the latter half of 1999 and will be completed by the end of the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that phase II of the works to the main block of Castletown House are now practically completed and will be finished by November next.  This phase involves mechanical, electrical, fire and security works and structural repairs which are necessary to secure the fabric of the house and to install all the necessary infrastructure to ensure that it complies with the best current practice and standards for historic buildings in respect of fire, security, health and safety requirements.</P>
      <P>There are a range of further works, consisting primarily of structural works, site services and finishes in key areas which ideally need to be undertaken before the house re-opens to the public. While these works could be undertaken at a later stage, it is more cost effective and less disruptive to undertake them while the house is closed.  The objective, therefore, is to reopen the house to the public in Easter 1999.</P>
      <P>All the works undertaken to date including the essential ones referred to earlier relate to securing the fabric of the house and to the protection of the house from such hazards as fire and intrusion.  A further programme of works is proposed to undertake interior restoration in the house and to provide visitor facilities both in the house and in the demesne generally.  It is proposed to undertake these works on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The total amount of the capitation grants paid by my Department for the 1997 school year in relation to the three schools in the Jobstown parish of Tallaght, Dublin 24, amounted to £87,279, based on a combined enrolment for the three schools of 1,106 pupils as at September 1997.  A further £33,240 was paid out in capitation grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme and £4,500 under the early start scheme, giving a total figure of £37,740 under these two schemes which are specifically aimed at the disadvantaged sector.  Furthermore, an additional capitation grant of £15,000 for the provision of caretaking and clerical assistance was paid to one of the three schools.  The total amount of capitation grants therefore paid to schools in the Jobstown parish in the 1997-98 school year was £140,019.</P>
      <P>It would appear from our records that the Foxrock parish is in fact in Dublin 18, and not Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin.  In any event, the total amount of the capitation grants paid by my Department to the two schools in that parish, with a combined enrolment of 1,383 as at September 1997, in the 1997-8 school year was £58,170.  In addition, one of the schools received an additional capitation grant of £7,500 for the provision of caretaking services.  The total amount of capitation grants paid to schools in the Foxrock parish in the 1997-8 school year therefore amounted to £65,670.  The schools in the Foxrock parish did not benefit under the schemes aimed at disadvantaged schools which are referred to in the previous paragraph.</P>

      <Quest>the reason secretarial administrators throughout the primary school sector have not received a pay increase since 1992; the reasons this category of worker remain outside the national pay agreements; the proposals, if any, he has to rectify the pay scale for these workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department provide funding towards the cost of secretarial services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978 scheme for the employment of school secretaries under which my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI. School secretaries employed under the terms of this scheme have received pay increases as provided for under the various national pay agreements. This scheme is, however, being phased out as posts become vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second scheme is the provision by my Department of additional capitation grants for <Col N="659" /> primary schools as agreed under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress &mdash; PESP &mdash; which has been in operation since 1 September 1992.  The PESP scheme provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of secretarial services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.  This scheme did not provide for the linking of those additional capitation grants to any particular payscale.  The grants of £15 per pupil are based on school enrolments and are paid as additions to the standard per capita grant.  The level and extent of service provided is a matter for local school management who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for clerical services.</P>
    <P>Since its introduction in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in the PESP.  The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment threshold to its current figure of 195 pupils, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that I remain committed to improvements in the provision of additional assistance to schools for clerical services and the position of schools which are currently in receipt of the maximum grant available under the scheme will be examined in the context of any improvements to the scheme which may be implemented in the future.</P>

      <P>Circular letters issued to the authorities of second level schools by my Department specify the hours to be allocated to guidance where additional posts have been made available on an ex-quota basis for this purpose.  Where guidance is being provided within the school's normal quota of teachers, then the actual number of hours to be allocated has not been specified, although the relevant circular letters have stated that a reasonable portion of the guidance counsellor's time should be devoted to guidance work. The basis for determining the ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance was changed in 1995.  The circular letter issued by my Department to individual schools at that time specified that the additional allocation arising from the change was to be used for the provision of guidance services only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guidelines for the practice of guidance and <Col N="660" /> counselling in schools were prepared by the National Centre for Guidance in Education and issued to all schools by my Department in early 1996.  The guidelines specify the various activities that should be expected of guidance counsellors. However, priorities will vary slightly according to the needs of each school.  For this reason, the guidelines recommend that each school should develop a plan for guidance, which includes the setting of priorities.  A working party in my Department has conducted a review of all the circular letters relating to guidance.  It is producing recommendations for me, which will be discussed with the interested parties before any revised circular letters are issued.</P>

      <P>All second level schools in the free education scheme have an ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance.  The ex-quota allocation in respect of guidance to individual second level schools in a particular school year is determined by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September. The allocation varies from 0.1 of a post to schools in the free education scheme with less than 100 pupils to 2 posts in the case of schools with 1,000 or more pupils.  The total allocation in respect of guidance for the 1998-9 school year is approximately 567 whole-time teacher equivalents. A similar allocation was made for the 1997-8 school year.  The question of increasing the allocation for guidance must be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

My Department will be happy to progress such discussions.</P>
      <P>A new north inner city community college is due to open in September 1999.

      <P>The area based partnerships are funded at present as part of the EU aided Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development 1994-99 co-ordinated by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  The continued operation of the partnerships after the current round of EU Structural Funds and their scope and function will be influenced by emerging developments generally regarding both the negotiations for the new round of EU funding and a greater integration between the local Government and the local development systems.  I am committed to the promotion of an integrated area-based approach to addressing educational disadvantage, and to the enhancement of links between education providers and community, youth, welfare, employer and training interests. My Department will continue to work closely with local development interests in the future to achieve the objective of integrated area planning and a strengthening of home, school and community links.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment at St. Brigid's national school on 30 September 1997 was 114 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and three teachers for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>This arrangement may be deviated from if a school is in breach of maximum class sizes guidelines. However, available evidence suggests that the school's current enrolment of 125 pupils can be organised within these guidelines.

      <P>The position is that allocations including secretarial and caretaking provisions for vocational schools and community colleges are approved to vocational education committees on a scheme basis.  It is a matter for each VEC to deploy clerical and caretaking staff to meet the needs of its committee and schools as it sees fit. As pay budgets for vocational education committees, which are based on and subject to their approved staffing allocations, are made on a block basis, and as such costs are not separately identified in the vocational education committees annual financial returns, the information sought on school secretarial and caretaking costs is not readily available in my Department.</P>
      <P>The general position is that each vocational school and community college with an enrolment in excess of 250 students is provided with a secretary and caretaker on a full-time basis and the salary of these employees is provided for in full by my Department in the annual pay budget of vocational education committees.</P>
