      <P>It is proposed to take No. 24b, Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998 &mdash; Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; No. 4, European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1998 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second and Remaining Stages; No. 22, motion re Treaty of Amsterdam shall be taken at the conclusion of the proceedings on the Second Stage of No. 4; No. 32, Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997 [<i>Seanad</i>] &mdash; Second Stage (Resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Report and Final Stages of No. 24b shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.30 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; (2) the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 4 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Bill, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; (3) No. 22 shall be decided without debate; and, (4) any division demanded today on the Second Stage of No. 32 shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Tuesday, 30 June 1998.</P>

      <P>There are four proposals to be put before the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 24b agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 4 agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22 agreed? Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 32 agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has promised to introduce legislation which will allow for the early release of certain paramilitary prisoners for particular offences and for the release of others who committed similar offences but were not associated with particular organisations of a paramilitary character.  When will this legislation be <Col N="230" /> published and brought before the House and, in light of the Newtownhamilton bomb, how will it ensure the individuals being released will stay on ceasefire and not drift to organisations such as the CAC or the INLA which are not on ceasefire?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be taken in the House next Thursday and I hope it will be published on Monday.  I will finalise details of that with the party spokespersons on Monday.  I wish to take this opportunity to condemn the atrocity in Newtownhamilton which affected Catholics and Protestants alike both in terms of injury and damage to property.  This was a dangerous act of stupidity by paramilitaries.  It appears that a paramilitary group has claimed responsibility in this instance but I do not know whether that information is correct.  Clearly, people who are not on ceasefire cannot be considered for early release in any form, now or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Taoiseach in condemning the Newtownhamilton bombing.  It is very important that procedures for early release are clear and transparent to ensure that people who have not made up their minds to stay on ceasefire must do so definitively in a manner which would be acceptable to the Minister before the benefits of the legislation could be extended to them.  Clearly, it would not be desirable for people whose stance on violence is ambiguous to be released.  I hope the legislation will not merely be enabling legislation and that the House will have an opportunity to debate this very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in condemning the Newtownhamilton bombing as totally and utterly anti-democratic as well as dangerous to life and limb.  No comfort should be given to those who allegedly claim responsibility for it.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach join me in urging a maximum turnout in today's elections in Northern Ireland and convey our support to all the parties participating in the democratic process there, in particular to those parties which support the Agreement which was so massively endorsed in the recent referenda here and in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be a massive vote today for those candidates who stand for peace and for the future, as most do.  Twelve parties are participating in the elections and I hope there will be a massive turnout today as the elections represent another step on the road to democracy.  They will result in the establishment of a new institution which will break away from direct rule for the first time in more than a quarter of a century.  I trust the people of Northern Ireland will go to the polls in great numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach, Deputies Bruton and Quinn in condemning yesterday's explosion and hope the people of Northern Ireland will provide the bombers with their <Col N="231" /> answer in today's election by supporting those candidates who want peace and want to advance the Agreement.  Virtually all the parties in the North support the Agreement.</P>
      <P>In regard to promised legislation, a Firearms (Amendment) Bill was promised for next week. When does the Taoiseach expect that Bill will be circulated so that we can prepare a response to it?</P>
      <P>When will the broadcasting Bill be introduced? Will the Taoiseach indicate if it will cover print media as well as the electronic media?  Does he consider it would be a good idea to have a press council which would prevent the appalling intrusion into the private lives of citizens of this State by photographs such as that carried by <i>The Star</i> yesterday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The broadcasting Bill will be published later this year.  I am not sure if it will cover the matters raised by the Deputy, but the Minister will take account of whatever proposals are put forward.  The legislation will be in accordance with the proposals set out by the Minister some time ago.  It will cover digitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if it is intended to enact the constituency boundary review Bill before the summer recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have mentioned the firearms Bill which Deputy De Rossa raised.  As I mentioned to Deputy Higgins yesterday, that Bill arose out of a court case last week and, unfortunately, we cannot comply with the normal two week rule.  Staff are working on the legislation and I have been assured they will try to complete it over the weekend.  I believe it will be Monday morning before it will be completed.</P>
      <P>I understand the Electoral Bill was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell must be concerned about the next one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell is so secure he does not have to worry about those matters.</P>
      <P>Regarding the firearms Bill, there have been great concerns about the increased level of suicide, particularly among young people.  One of the suggestions put forward was to further tighten up the firearms legislation in regard to the availability of firearms which might be used by people attempting to take their own lives.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might avail of the opportunity of that legislation to see if any improvements that could be made in the context of the alarming and disturbing growth in the level of suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will raise that matter with the Minister.  Our efforts will be put into trying to correct the flaws that have arisen.  In recent years there has been an alarming growth in the rate of suicide and that has been highlighted in this House in numerous debates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the promised minerals development Bill, is the Taoiseach aware that a company, which is about to commence drilling for oil off the coast of Mayo next week under licence from the Government, is refusing to employ any Irish labour on its oil rig?  Will he indicate if the licence of that company can be revoked under existing legislation or if such a provision will be included in the minerals development Bill?  When will that Bill be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach commented yesterday on the Bill to set up the Western Development Commission on a statutory basis, but it is not due to be introduced until the end of the year and it could be 1999 before it becomes effective. The commission that has been set up has a number of proposals for employment that are ready to proceed pending funding.  Can some mechanism be put in place whereby, pending the commission being set up on a statutory basis, those initiatives, where approved, can be given assistance from the fund set aside for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the review group on structural funding is meeting today to reallocate money that will not be spent on Luas within the timeframe of the operational programme.  Is there any mechanism for worthy projects like the Dublin-Rosslare rail link to be assured of consideration in the reallocation of funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>About eight weeks ago the Taoiseach said legislation on the setting up of a statutory sports council would be presented in about <Col N="233" /> four weeks' time.  What is the reason for the delay?  He refused to accept my Bill and the Government cannot produce its own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>After I spoke here the Minister made the position clear.  He stated that the Bill to establish the sports council on a statutory basis will be available later in 1998.  The legislation will be ready in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

      <P>On promised legislation, will the Taoiseach indicate when the defamation Bill will be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the reports in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> on the privatisation of certain key tasks currently performed by the Navy and Air Corps, will the Taoiseach indicate when the Price Waterhouse report will be officially available to this House, as opposed to it being leaked to <i>The Irish Times</i>?  Will we have a debate on the future of the Navy and the Air Corps before the summer recess based on the Price Waterhouse report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has not come to the Government yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report consists of a root and branch review of the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  It has been carried out over the past two years by the efficiency audit group.  Price Waterhouse was commissioned to prepare that report.  It is to be brought to Government within the next month and, as I said during Question Time yesterday, it will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>On promised legislation, given the commitment in the Government programme to relieve the Garda of certain duties and to establish a community warden service under the local authorities, will the Taoiseach indicate what stage that legislation is at?  Is it being drawn up by the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, that matter will follow the SMI review group work and, therefore, legislation on it is not being drafted at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from a question Deputy Kenny asked the Taoiseach on legislation on the commission for the west a system could be set up by the Minister for Finance to allow the £2 <Col N="234" /> million to be paid pending the introduction of the legislation for the very worthwhile projects that have been grant-aided in the west.  I would like if the Taoiseach could help in that regard because it is likely that money will not be made available until very late this year or early next year and a commitment was given by the authorities in respect of those projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, spoke extensively about this the other day.  We are trying to get this legislation through and the Minister of State is considering mechanisms to deal with the issue raised by the two Deputies.  It will be difficult to clear the funding prior to the introduction of the legislation, but he is considering mechanisms to see how quickly this can be dealt with.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> The previous Government did a great deal of work on the establishment of a prisons board.  An expert group was established and reported.  It produced the heads of a Bill which were given to the Department. However, no legislation has been produced. Overcrowding continues and the revolving door syndrome still rules.  Why has this Bill not been treated as a priority given that so much of the preparatory work has been completed?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 6, to delete &ldquo;section 1(2) or 15&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;section 1(2), 9 or 15&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Noonan put down three amendments similar to amendment No. 2 which I was unable to accept on that Stage.  The Deputy agreed to withdraw the amendments if I agreed to examine whether section 9 could be amended to take on board the point made by the Deputy.  I agreed to so do and I advised the committee that any such change would require a consequential amendment to section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 provides that the Minister may, by order, set a date before 30 June 2002 for the withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins.  Given the importance of such an order, the Deputy asked that I consider an amendment which would require a positive resolution of the Oireachtas in relation to it.  After considering the matter, I put down amendments Nos. 1 and 3 to take on board the point made by the Deputy. Amendment No. 3 provides that any order under <Col N="238" /> section 9 must be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and that the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House.  In other words, a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be required before an order can be made to set a date earlier than 30 June 2002 for the withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins.  I accept that it is proper that both Houses of the Oireachtas should have the opportunity to debate the withdrawal date and to approve a draft order containing it before the order is made.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the drafting formulation used in amendment No. 3 in my name is normal in such circumstances.  It differs from the wording proposed by Deputy Noonan in amendment No. 4 but I am sure he will agree that it meets his point of requiring the positive approval of each House. If amendment No. 3 is agreed, it will be necessary to amend section 4 in consequence.  Amendment No. 1 proposes, therefore, to replace &ldquo;section 1(2) or 15&rdquo; in section 4 with a reference to &ldquo;section 1(2), 9 or 15&rdquo;.  This is because section 9, as amended, will provide for the laying before the Oireachtas of orders made under it.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage yesterday a number of points were raised arising from amendments tabled by Deputy Noonan and I promised to return to them today.  There is no obligation on banks to accept coins other than the general legal tender obligation relating to coins.  This Bill does not create such an obligation.  The Central Bank and the banks recognise, however, that the changeover to the euro is an unprecedented event. Decimalisation in 1971 affected only a limited number of coins.  It did not affect notes.  I understand a fee was not paid by the Central Bank to the banks for the removal of coins.  Such a fee is not envisaged for the euro changeover.</P>
    <P>The changeover to the euro will involve a full replacement of all notes and coins.  It will also involve major questions of packaging, storage and distribution on which the Central Bank is engaged in active discussions with the banks. Everyone involved is conscious of the points made yesterday and I am confident that a smooth and orderly system of getting euro notes and coins out to the public and Irish pound notes and coins out of circulation as quickly as possible will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The changeover to euro notes and coins will not start until 1 January 2002.  The logistics have not yet been sorted out.  In that context I note the point raised about sterling coins circulating in Ireland.  The Central Bank is also aware of this point but it is too early to say what is to be done about it.</P>
    <P>As regards the calling in of coins, section 15 extends the existing calling in power of the Minister for Finance to cover coins issued under this Bill and euro coins issued by other participating member states.  In recent times 10p and 5p coins were called in and replaced by new versions.  This did not give rise to extra bank charges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="239" /> Deputy Fleming asked about the phrase in section 10 about 50 coins denominated in euro or in cent.  This does not mean that only 50 one cent coins can be tendered in a single transaction. There will be eight values of euro coins: one, two, five, ten, 20 and 50 cent and one and two euro. When euro coins come into circulation no one other than the Central Bank and anyone designated by order will be obliged to accept more than 50 in a single transaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming asked at what point in the present coinage and in the euro coinage metal cost exceeds face value.  Metal prices can fluctuate but I am informed that at current metal prices face value exceeds metal cost in all cases.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with one other point about the laying of orders before the Oireachtas raised by Deputy Noonan.  Section 15 provides that an order calling in coins must give at least six months notice after the date of making before it comes into operation.  Deputy Noonan argued that the notice period should start from the date the order is laid before the Oireachtas.  It is my intention and that of my Department to ensure that any such order is laid before the House without delay. As they relate to the calling in of coins, such orders are of substantial interest to the Oireachtas.  They are also of interest to the general public and it is important that uncertainty should not attach to them.  By its nature, the date on which the order is made is a known and certain date but the date of laying the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas is not.  This has the potential to cause uncertainty.  I am not in a position, therefore, to accept the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for meeting fairly most of the points raised yesterday on Committee Stage.  If he decides to withdraw Irish notes and coins from circulation on any date prior to the last day of June 2002, such an order will be circulated to Members and require positive affirmation by the Houses of the Oireachtas before it becomes law.  I welcome this change.  May I take it that this is being confined to section 9 and is not being extended to the normal power to make regulations and orders under other sections?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to subvert the distinction between primary and secondary legislation as it is proper that a Minister should be able to do certain things by way of regulation and order but matters of magnitude should be subject to positive affirmation, if not dealt with in primary legislation.  I agree with the Minister that his amendment is more in keeping with normal drafting practice as followed in other Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister availed of the opportunity to deal with other matters raised yesterday but has not seen fit to table amendments.  He has given a strong commitment that an order to withdraw coinage will be laid before the Houses of the <Col N="240" /> Oireachtas without delay.  This is stronger than &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; but the point is valid.  If policy-makers have decided that it would be proper to give the public six months notice, this should not be reduced because of technicalities in the making of orders.  If an order were made by the Minister but not promulgated until several weeks or months later, that would be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister on his explanation of how the Central Bank, the clearing banks and other financial houses will deal with the withdrawal of coinage and notes and the putting into circulation of the euro, establishing it not only as the legal tender but also as the currency of commerce and trade.  At the level of first principles, this is a republic governed by law, not by lawyers, politicians, bankers or central bankers.  The currency with which we have been familiar since the foundation of the State is to be withdrawn and replaced by a new currency in one of the great economic decisions of the 20th century, not only in Ireland but also in Europe.  This decision must be underpinned by law.</P>
    <P>The right of a person to take any quantity they like of coins or notes denominated in Irish currency into a bank and exchange it for the euro must be enshrined in law.  To rely on procedure and practice, the goodwill of the banking system and the efficiency of the Central Bank is not the way to proceed.  The child with a piggy bank, the political activist with the church gate collection and the small shopkeeper with coinage have a legal right to exchange it for the euro.  Without legal rights, relying on grace and favour procedures in the banking system, there is always a danger that charges will be imposed.  The bank will oblige people but they will charge a small commission.  If one brings in a bag of coins, one is already charged commission.  However, the magnitude of this issue is such that it should be underpinned in law on every occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed the House of the detailed arrangements which will be made.  I am delighted the Central Bank is firmly in control of the changes that will be made, and will be involved in the necessary discussions to ensure that the withdrawal and distribution of the alternative currency will be planned carefully. However, there is a point to be met in ensuring that the citizen has a legal right to exchange any quantity of coins.</P>

      <P>On Deputy Noonan's point about the timescale, the most recent calling in orders related to the shilling, 5p, two shilling and 10p coins.  The order for the shilling and 5p coins was made on 28 April 1992 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 April 1992.  The order regarding the two shilling and 10p coins was made on 16 September 1993 and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 21 September 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made a strong point about covering this area in legislation.  I considered the matter further after the Committee Stage debate yesterday, but I have concluded it is not necessary to <Col N="241" /> insert a provision in that regard.  There are three and a half years between now and 1 January 2002 and there is plenty of time to work out these matters. A compulsion was not placed on the banks in the past.  Instead it was left to the Central Bank and the banks to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing negotiations on all these areas between the Central Bank and the financial institutions.  If a satisfactory outcome on the matter raised by the Deputy about banks not taking in coins from individuals is not reached between now and 1 January 2002, I will have no hesitation in introducing amending legislation.  It is not necessary to include a provision on this occasion. I am satisfied that agreement will be reached by the Central Bank and the banks on this matter and there is no need for compulsion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 19, to delete &ldquo;£250&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a repeat of an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage which did not find favour with the Minister.  When a resolution is passed by an extraordinary general meeting of a company in respect of the renominalisation of shares, there is a requirement for copies of the resolution to be filed with the Registrar of Companies.  If there is a failure to file, the penalty is a maximum fine of £250 on summary conviction.  I argued on Committee Stage that a maximum fine of £250 on a company is a derisory amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If requirements are to be placed on companies to file documents with the Registrar of Companies, we must show that the intention is serious by having penalties which are connected to the real world.  The section makes provision for a maximum fine of £250.  However, the practice in the District Court on summary conviction is usually not to apply the maximum fine.  The level of fine is at the discretion of the District Court judge up to the amount of £250.  In practice, the maximum is rarely imposed.  Therefore, under the <Col N="242" /> section, the fine will not necessarily be £250, rather an amount up to that limit.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas traditionally have been good law making fora.  However, while the Republic is excellent at making laws, it is bad at enforcing them.  There are plenty of examples where we consider that the job has been done once legislation is enacted.  However, the level of enforcement is not great.  Ireland is a nation of talkers.  A need is satisfied once a matter has been debated.  The pubs are full of people like that; they debate issues forever.  Similarly, the pubs of Dublin are full of men who plan to write books, but it never happens.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the implementation of laws, the penalties should be realistic.  It is unrealistic to decide that a procedure must be followed by a company but if it does not follow it, it will be fined a maximum of £250, which I consider derisory.  It does not make sense.  At a general level, it brings our work into disrepute.  If the matter is serious enough to require it to be done under pain of penalty, it is important.  Consequently, the penalty should at least give discretion to the District Court judge to impose a reasonable amount.  At least then it would be a slap on the wrist for the company and not a matter which is treated with derision.  The penalty on the company will be that it must pay lawyers rather than having to pay the fine if it is prosecuted in the District Court under this section.</P>
    <P>My amendment suggests £1,000 as a maximum fine, which is also a modest amount.  The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service will debate the Investor Compensation Bill today. The Minister is aware the penalties under that legislation are much more severe, although the consequences of the implementation of the provisions if a company failed to comply would be more onerous on investors.  It is not a straight comparison but the Investor Compensation Bill contains significant penalties.  A maximum fine of £250 under this Bill is not significant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I understand the fine proposed in the Bill will be low and a fine of £1,000 would be a standard amount for many of the offences covered by company law.</P>
      <P>I will express a concern I did not have an opportunity to mention yesterday because I had a prior engagement regarding the denomination of fines in criminal law in IR£.  Is the Minister satisfied that the regulations will be sufficient to redenominate fines in criminal law in the euro? Will it be necessary to introduce amendments to specific laws?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's point is that criminal law lists fines in IR£ and his query is whether there is a need to amend legislation to take account of the change to the euro.  I am advised that it is covered in European law, but <Col N="243" /> we will return for further details if the Deputy wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that it is fine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reflected on this amendment since Committee Stage and Deputy Noonan will recall I explained that the fine not exceeding £250 arises in circumstances where the company fails to send a copy of the resolution passed by the company to renominalise the share capital to the Companies Registration Office for recording. Furthermore, this section and the previous two sections are designed to facilitate companies in the changeover to the euro; in effect, these are dedicated provisions dealing with redenomination and redenominalisation compared with existing company law provisions.  For a company to achieve the equivalent end result using existing procedures would be considerably more complicated. For example, where renominalisation would involve a decrease in share capital, it would involve court approval.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, we are putting a simplified procedure in place to facilitate companies on the introduction of the euro.  In companies legislation, two provisions are particularly relevant in the context of the present amendment.  Section 143 of the Companies Act, 1963, provides for the forwarding of resolutions passed by companies in various circumstances to the Companies Registration Office.  Where a company fails to comply with this section, a person who is in default is liable to a fine not exceeding £250.  More specifically, section 68 of the same Act deals with the power of a company to alter share capital by members in general meeting.  Again, copies of the resolution making such a change must be notified to the Companies Registration Office under section 69 and a person in default is liable to a fine not exceeding £250.  This fine is a revised amount introduced by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1982.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that the fine of £250 is the correct amount and I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>Redenominalisation is at the lower end of seriousness of charges that could be brought under the Companies Act.  It is a long time since I looked at the Companies Act, which is a mammoth document with a large range of penalties, but the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is carrying out a major review of company law and I am sure these matters will be reviewed.  I do not want to increase the fine to a figure not to exceed £1,000 and then to have someone point out that the fine for a more serious breach of company law is a lot less.  That is not the proper procedure and for this and other reasons I have decided to leave the fine at £250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept Deputy Noonan's point on bringing the law into disrepute.  We pass laws but do not implement them or allocate enough staff to enforce them.  Old Acts with low fines bring the law into disrepute, but I do not think it appropriate <Col N="244" /> to amend company law on a piecemeal basis. For those reasons I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister but I also understand Deputy Noonan's point.  Rather than looking at this in a piecemeal basis, we should do as the Minister says and look at the range of fines in company law.  I predict that under current arrangements we will find that, five years after the introduction of the euro, thousands of Irish companies will not have notified the Companies Registration Office of their formal resolutions, yet none will be brought to court or fined £250.</P>
      <P>If there is a date by which a company must fulfil its obligations under the Companies Act that the company fails to do so, interest and penalties should accrue and the matter should then be forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners.  It could then become part of the fine imposed in the company's tax settlement.  Going to court for £250 would clog up the courts and be a waste of time and money.</P>
      <P>We are either serious about these fines or we are not, and even if they are small there must be a simple way to collect them.  Perhaps they should be collected automatically by the Revenue Commissioners when they are overdue.  We should not look at this fine in isolation because there is a broader issue here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should inform us whether, across the whole corpus of law where there are penalties, the Government plans to denominate all penalties in law in euros.  If so, will there be discretion for rounding those penalties up or down just as there is for companies which denominate their shares into euros?  It seems anachronistic that our laws are littered with penalties expressed in pounds; every time a district judge imposes a fine the clerk will have to get a calculator to turn it into euros using the exchange rate.  That will be great fun.  Nobody has referred to this, but it will have to be done.  The facilities afforded to private enterprises will have to be extended to fines also.  There will have to be a mechanism to round fines off so that £250 is not translated into a peculiar combination of euros and cents which does not appear sensible as a maximum fine.  If that is so, I presume one piece of enabling legislation will be brought in to <Col N="245" /> trigger everything to round sums off to the nearest euro.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider a fines indexation Bill.  It seems that fines are always out of date, often appearing to be out of date by the time the law is implemented.  In times of high inflation they go out of date very quickly, and a fines indexation Bill would be simple enough legislation, though the Department of Justice has traditional reasons of principle for not proceeding in this way.  It holds that each Act and penalty has its own validity and that having common criteria for raising fines is not in accordance with best judicial or law reform practice.  However, even if there were objections to applying an index to criminal law an index could be applied to company law.  The Minister should discuss with the Tánaiste the possibility of taking note of the increase in inflation since fines were upgraded in 1982, increasing the fines and denominating them in euros.</P>
      <P>I know why the Minister is not accepting my amendment.  It has nothing to do with the invalidity of my argument.  It is because it arises from the 1982 revision in company law.  The Minister is afraid that if it goes up to £1,000 it will be out of kilter with other penalties in the legislation.  It is the internal inconsistency that makes the Minister's advisers reluctant to change rather than any flaw in my argument.  If the Minister refuses to make change on a piecemeal basis for good and valid reasons, he will never make change.</P>
      <P>This makes apparent another problem in the way we legislate.  The departmentalisation of the process causes difficulties.  The Tánaiste's office, being responsible for company law, should upgrade fines right across the board.  Then we would not have this difficulty.  The precedent for the Minister's Bill comes from company law and the fine is £250, so the Minister feels he has no discretion because it would stick out like a sore thumb in the corpus of company law if a requirement to file in one instance was associated with a penalty of £1,000 and a requirement to file documents elsewhere was associated with a penalty of £250.  The matter should be seriously addressed. A fines indexation Bill of some sort which applied right across the board would have favourable consequences for the Revenue, and the courts would have more discretion in the imposition of fines.</P>

      <P>European law and the European Law directive, Council Regulation 974/98 Article 14, states that where a legal instrument is existing at the end of the transitional period, reference is made to the national currency units; these references shall be read as references to the euro unit according to the respective conversion rates; and the ground rules laid down in regulation No. 1103/97 shall apply.</P>

      <P>The legal base is covered by this regulation, but in relation to the Deputy's other point, there could be very unusual fines as a result of the conversion.  It may be necessary for individual Ministers to bring piecemeal legislation before the House and avail of the opportunity of standardising fines to round euro amounts.  As of now the legal base is there and it will happen automatically.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also made a case for a fines indexation Bill.  That could be considered in the future but it is not something for me to consider at this time.  I see some merit in what the Deputy says, but a fines indexation Bill would lead to unusual amounts.  Some other mechanism would have to be found to round the figures.  The subject can be considered at another time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Fleming also raised questions about fines.  Not all companies renominalise their share capital.  Also this provision ceases to have effect 18 months from 1 January 2002, which means it will cease to have effect on 30 June 2003. I agree with the Deputy that all fines should be kept under review, and I am sure the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan raised in Committee the difference in drafting between sections 11 and 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained that the difference arises because <Col N="247" /> section 11 reflected the wording of the treaty in relation to coins intended for circulation across the euro area, while section 30 reflected previous Irish law on commemorative coins.</P>
    <P>However, I agreed with the Deputy that it was desirable to have consistency in drafting within the Bill in so far as possible, and I undertook to see whether I could accept the Deputy's suggestion that the wording of section 30 be aligned with that of section 11.  I have now considered the question, and I have joined the Deputy in proposing this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am not too sure whether I am correct, but I think this is the first occasion where an amendment was tabled jointly by a Minister and the Opposition spokesperson.  Perhaps we have created history.  I agreed with this amendment and added my name to it.  It is Deputy Noonan's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this legislation successfully through the House.  It is the last serious Bill which will be brought through in preparation for the euro.  It is important to reflect on a point which Deputy Pat Rabbitte raised in Committee and which, because of the rules of Committee, could not be adequately dealt with.  That is the issue of inflation, the possibility of asymmetric shocks in the future and how an Irish administration would be empowered in dealing with such shocks.  The Minister should reflect on this and give us an opportunity at a future date to reflect further.  I do not want to pursue the inflation argument at the moment, but it is important to note that what is happening in Europe from 1 January next is not unique.  There have been currency unions before. There were five in the 19th century.  Two succeeded admirably and three failed miserably. Those that succeeded were driven by a strong political agenda.  Those that failed were simply put in place because of some perceived advantages in terms of trade and commerce and eventually disappeared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People in Ireland would be familiar with the circumstances in regard to those that succeeded. I recall at one period that if students doing history <Col N="248" /> in the leaving certificate did not get a question on the unification of Germany they got one on the unification of Italy.  If they studied both they were sure of passing one question.  Both of these unifications were preceded by monetary union and because the political momentum was so strong towards a united Germany and a united Italy monetary union succeeded and knitted into a political union.  If there is any pulling back in Europe from further integration and from a progressive move towards political union, over one or two generations, what we are doing now will fall apart.</P>
    <P>I hope the discussions in Cardiff were simply an aberration arising from the fact that there will be a general election in Germany in September because it seems that all the bogus talk about subsidiarity is at attempt to reintroduce an argument that was dealt with 15 years ago.  Reintroducing it now seems to be an attempt to diminish the powers of the Commission and of the centre and move back towards greater control by the governments of member states.  That argument is in the past.  The perceived reluctance of those who have been the net payers to Europe since the Treaty of Rome to continue to be net payers will have adverse effects.</P>
    <P>We have to consider what we can do as an Irish Parliament if things go seriously wrong.  What mechanisms will be left open to us?  Monetary and interest rate policy is gone.  We may get heavy-handed advice on fiscal policy but it is not easy to cut public expenditure or renege on obligations to the social partners and to the citizenry at large to give tax relief.  Much of the economic advice comes from people who, in the refined world of academia, can afford to speculate along these lines but in the real world their collective advice does not amount to anything a practical man could use.</P>
    <P>The most successful monetary union is the United States which has automatic stabilisers built into its system between the federal and the state governments.  If the grape harvest fails in California and it appears that the Californian GDP will be reduced, there are automatic arrangements between the federal and state budgets which immediately kick into place.  The contribution from the state is lessened and, in certain circumstances, the transfer from the centre is increased.</P>
    <P>The European budget is 1.27 per cent of GNP and it simply is not big enough to have any transfer of funds engineered by the Commission to member states who are in trouble.  The stability pact which is in place puts the onus firmly on the member states to fund themselves.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House much further but I would like the Minister to consider, with his advisers and excellent civil servants, putting together a portfolio of policies which could be implemented if things go wrong domestically. They could also consider the possibility of putting in place other levers which, in general terms, will be of a fiscal nature.  We cannot throw our hands <Col N="249" /> up in the air and say there is nothing we can do. A combination of the provisions of the stability pact, together with specific fiscal measures, should be considered for the future so that if something happens we will not be totally exposed on the European stage.  I realise the Chair becomes agitated when he hears long contributions on Fifth Stage but I would like the Minister to reflect on what I have said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond briefly to the points raised by Deputy Noonan.  Even though he merely touched on this matter, he raised some fundamental questions about the way Europe will develop.  He pointedly referred to the deliberations at the Cardiff Summit.  There seems to be a major divergence in regard to what happens at European Council and ECOFIN meetings, what some of the larger states want <i>vis-a -vis</i> the smaller states and what they want for themselves. On the one hand, they want the Commission to take immediate and punitive action regarding the states with which they do not agree while looking for more subsidiarity on the other.</P>
      <P>From my experience of attending ECOFIN and European Council meetings I am aware of a growing frustration on the part of many member states with the increasing number of rules and restrictions emanating from the European Commission. That may affect the thinking of some member states but they do not follow the logic of their arguments because they say they want more subsidiarity at home but demand more regulations to affect matters that legitimately come within the remit of individual member states.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Noonan is of major significance and that is the prognostications from the net payers to the Community.  I agree with the Deputy that some of the papers have taken up this issue over the past year and put forward the view that it may have something to do with forthcoming elections in certain countries. That must be taken into account in some of the thinking but after many months of attending ECOFIN Council meetings I have concluded &mdash; I made my views known to my officials &mdash; that this is no longer a put-on game.  Many of the bureaucrats and civil servants throughout Europe appeared to give the impression that this was an optics exercise, so to speak, for the people back home, but this is a real game and more and more people have come around to my view in that regard.  At nearly every second meeting a point is made about this and there is enormous pressure from some of the bigger contributors to get back some of their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to pre-empt what might happen in that particular regard but we cannot allow a situation to develop whereby the principle is established that one must get back exactly what one puts in.  The principle behind the European ideal would no longer exist if that were the case. If everybody in Ireland said they wanted to get back the equivalent amount of money they paid <Col N="250" /> in taxation, the country would be unable to operate.</P>
    <P>There will be further debate about the net contributions of some member states but we cannot allow a situation to develop where, pound for pound, we must get back what we put in.  If that principle had been applied in the early 1970s we would not have been allowed to join.  I expect that within the next decade Ireland will become a net contributor, and rightly so.  I have got into difficulty for expressing some of these views but I believe that when a market or business in a town grows, everybody benefits.  The net contributions to Ireland have been substantial but other European states have benefited from Ireland's prosperity by way of developments here.</P>
    <P>In many instances there is ambiguity from Europe.  On one hand it holds us up as the great example of what can be done if funds are utilised effectively, which embodies the European ideal. The impression is given that Ireland, which was at a certain stage of development 25 years ago, is today an example to the rest of Europe and the world.  On the other hand, increasingly envious eyes are cast on Ireland by other member states. There is a contradiction there and the logic behind the position of some people, including many Europeans, is not followed through.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked what policy tools would be available, and we discussed this matter on many occasions, including yesterday.  In the rundown to EMU a strict line has been taken as to what will be available.  We want to ensure monetary union will operate under a strict regime and that the new currency will have great credibility throughout the world.  I am certain that in three or four years as we move forward, items will be considered which are not under consideration now because we are engaged in trying to ensure monetary union gets off to a sound and stable start.  I am sure there will be many opportunities in future to debate this matter, but all we can do at this stage is wish it success.  We have done our homework and this should be the last Bill to be brought before the House on this matter before economic and monetary union commences on 1 January.  We will be involved in a great new experiment from that date.</P>
    <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions on Committee and Report Stages and for allowing the Bill to go through the House so quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an historic occasion because the House is signing off our currency, a currency which has been in use for only about 25 years.  Like virtually everybody in the House, I believe that monetary union is as much a political as an economic project.  In a sense it also has the potential to threaten the political unity of Europe and we should not lose track of that.  Monetary union is already used as an excuse by individual Governments to justify action they had to take in their own countries, in most cases action which they would have to take anyway.  There is always a great danger that, in a matter which is bureaucratic <Col N="251" /> and involves regulation and intervention of the kind with which people are not always comfortable, it will be remote from the ordinary citizenry and from individual legislators in particular countries.  We cannot allow monetary union to be scapegoated.  Reflecting on the Amsterdam Treaty, the deliberate effort made to bring Europe closer to the citizenry has not worked.  Perhaps as the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty operate in coming years, things will change, but I would not be too hopeful about that.</P>
      <P>On the stability and growth pact, we should be very careful about being clear that this is not written in stone.  The stability and growth agreement is no more than a political agreement that will have to be reviewed in two or three years' time, if not sooner.  In recent months the Bundesbank and Germany have been anxious to formulate monetary union in the way they want.  We do not have much choice about that, but we must keep an eye on the stability and growth pact.  We must insist, for example, that it serves the needs of a country such as Ireland which, unlike other countries which are developed to a greater degree, needs to spend money on infrastructure and to invest.  We should keep an eye on that ball because it will have to be considered in the future.  I join others in marking this historic day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This Bill amends the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended.  Thus it relates essentially to the Treaties which establish the European Communities, namely the European Community &mdash; EC &mdash; the European Coal and Steel Community &mdash; ECSC &mdash; and the European Atomic Energy Community.  I shall refer later to matters not dealt with in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect in domestic law to those provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which affect the treaties establishing the European Communities and the European Court of Justice. These are the provisions of the Treaty which must be made part of domestic law of the State prior to ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam by Ireland.  The long table of &ldquo;treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo; and other treaties and legal acts set out in the table to section 1 of the Bill will remind Deputies that similar Bills have been debated in this House prior to each significant stage in the development of the European Union since Ireland's accession to the then European Communities in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the contents of the Bill, I would like to refer briefly to the recent referendum. On 22 May the electorate, in accepting <Col N="252" /> the Government's proposed amendments to the Constitution, demonstrated its endorsement of the Treaty of Amsterdam and of Ireland's full involvement in the development of the European Union.  Some commentators have claimed that the result of the referendum represented a victory for opponents of the treaty and of continued European integration, but the Government rejects this claim.  I do not deny that many voters may have felt uncertain about the significance of the treaty, resulting in a lower level of support than on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Treaty of Amsterdam is an amending treaty, not a stand-alone text.  Read in isolation, it is without question a difficult document to comprehend.  Furthermore, this was not a treaty which contained a &ldquo;central issue&rdquo; which could engage popular attention.  It consists of many improvements and a number of important new provisions, but no single idea comparable to the Single Market in the Single European Act and EMU in the Maastricht Treaty, which in addition established the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Co-operation in Justice and Home Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Government does not accept that the outcome of the referendum signals any diminution of support among the people for our full participation in the European Union.  The majority of people remain convinced, and with good reason, that European integration is in the best interests of this country.</P>
    <P>I would also like to comment briefly on the role of the Referendum Commission, established by the Government to prepare and disseminate information on the Treaty and to promote public debate.  It is my belief &mdash; and research carried out by the Commission bears this out &mdash; that the information campaign organised by the commission was successful in raising awareness of the treaty.  The manner in which information is provided for referenda will be examined further by the Government in the light of our most recent experiences.  In this connection, the issue of information for referenda is being examined by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This is a very short Bill containing two sections and it is primarily technical in nature.  Section 1 is the principal operative part of the Bill.  It adds the relevant amending provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the list of treaties and other instruments contained in the definition of the &ldquo;treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo; in section 1(1) of the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended.  These are Article 1.13, Articles 2 to 12 and annexed Protocols.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of the reader, a table sets out the complete list of the treaties governing the European Communities contained in section 1(1) of the 1972 Act, as amended, together with the amendment now proposed in respect of the Amsterdam Treaty &mdash; new paragraph (S).</P>
    <P>Section 2 contains normal provisions concerning the short Title, collective citation, construction <Col N="253" /> and commencement of an Act of the Oireachtas.  Pursuant to this section, a commencement order will be made at the appropriate time providing for the entry into force of the Bill on the date that the Treaty of Amsterdam itself comes into force.</P>
    <P>I would like to set out those Articles of the Amsterdam Treaty which are referred to in section 1 of this Bill and which will thus be given the force of law in the State.  I do not propose to explain the substance of the Articles in detail today &mdash; the Dáil has already debated the treaty on a number of occasions and the people have given their verdict on it.  For ease of understanding, I will deal with the Articles under three broad categories: first, role of the European Court of Justice; second, substantive amendments to the European Communities Treaties and third, simplification and renumbering of the treaties.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Justice has always had jurisdiction under the First Pillar, which deals with Community matters.  When the Second and Third Pillars, dealing with the common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs, were set up by the Maastricht Treaty, the Court of Justice was not given jurisdiction over them, with one small exception for certain conventions concluded under the Third Pillar.</P>
    <P>Article 1.13 sets out the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty to which the powers of the Court of Justice apply.  In particular, it extends the jurisdiction of the court in the area of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, which is the new title for the Third Pillar.  Because it is important that Ireland be in a position to comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice on Third Pillar matters in the same way as it complies with the court's judgments in the First Pillar, it is necessary to give the force of law in the State to Article 1.13. This measure will ensure that police and judicial co-operation is carried out not only efficiently but also with increased protection for human rights.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 to 4 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, together with annexed Protocols, represent the main body of amendments to each of the treaties establishing the European Communities, that is, the treaties establishing the European Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and Euratom.  Articles 2 to 4 include a very wide range of provisions which improve the capacity of the Union for action, including closer co-operation among member states, non-discrimination, free movement of persons, employment, consumer protection, environmental protection, institutional reform and the right of access to Community documents.  Taken together they represent a modest but important contribution towards European integration and greater effectiveness and efficiency within the Union.  The changes also help the Union to prepare for enlargement and bring it closer to its citizens.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the Amsterdam Treaty deals with certain changes made in relation to the election of representatives to the European Parliament. <Col N="254" /> Taken together with other changes contained in Articles 2 to 4, these changes will affect the workings of the Parliament in a number of ways.  The new treaty will impose an upper limit of 700 on the membership of the Parliament, which is now 626.  It will also strengthen the role of the Parliament through a considerable extension of what is known as the co-decision procedure.  The co-decision procedure makes the Parliament in effect a co-legislator with the Council in the adoption of Community legislation.</P>
    <P>Articles 6 to 11 deal with the simplification of the treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related Acts.  Article 12 deals with renumbering.  The provisions on simplification of the treaties are a welcome first step in tidying up or pruning the various treaties and long obsolete provisions relating to the setting up of the Communities, the establishment of the Common Market. The Intergovernmental Conference negotiators also took the opportunity to renumber all the Articles of the EC and EU Treaties in a straightforward numerical sequence.  This is provided for in Article 12 of the Amsterdam Treaty. The end result of simplification and renumbering is that the treaties on which the Union is based will be shorter and more readable when the Amsterdam Treaty comes into effect.  Deputies who have an interest in EU law will wish to know that a publication containing the consolidated EC and EU treaties is available.  It reflects the changes made by the Treaty of Amsterdam, including the renumbering of Articles.  It will be very useful for reference purposes postAmsterdam.</P>
    <P>The matter of simplification of the treaties is of interest to all of us inasmuch as all measures which can help to make the workings of the European Union more clearly understood must be welcomed.  Government officials are participating actively in a new Brussels working group which has been asked to prepare guidelines on the quality of drafting of EU legislation in response to Declaration No. 39 annexed to the Final Act of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  In Declaration No. 39, the Intergovernmental Conference called on the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission to establish by common accord guidelines for improving the quality of drafting of Community legislation.  Deputies may also be aware that the Government took a decision on 24 February last to re-establish the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, which will have the task of consolidating Acts, such as the European Communities (Amendment) Acts. These measures should help to increase accessibility and transparency in relation to European law.</P>
    <P>Only certain provisions &mdash; those which I have described, namely Articles 1.  13 and 2 to 12 and annexed Protocols &mdash; of the Treaty of Amsterdam need to be made part of the domestic law of the State.  Other provisions in the treaty deal with procedural issues and matters of international treaty law and do not need to be reflected in our <Col N="255" /> legislation.  Examples are the general and final provisions setting out the indefinite duration of the treaty, the procedures for its ratification and entry into force and the authentic treaty languages.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the amendments to the European Communities Act proposed in the Bill do not include matters relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, provisions of the treaty.  This was also the case when the Act was amended prior to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  The reason is that the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions are essentially intergovernmental in nature.</P>
    <P>Subject to one exception in relation to the Court of Justice, of which I have already spoken, the amendments to the Act proposed in the Bill do not include matters related to police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  Police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, or the Third Pillar as it is commonly known, is contained in Article l of the Treaty of Amsterdam but is dealt with outside of the framework of the EC treaties.  Police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty, seeks to build on the co-operation which was formally established under the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Under this new treaty, the role of the Commission and European Parliament have been strengthened along with the role of the Court of Justice.  However, in keeping with their approach throughout the period since signature of the treaty, the Government has been careful to seek no more authority in this legislation than is strictly necessary for the purpose of giving effect in domestic law to the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Thus, no authority is sought to make statutory instruments for issues relating to the Third Pillar which may arise in the future.  These would be matters of sufficient weight as to merit primary legislation and thus full scrutiny by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 1 has been carefully drafted to ensure that all the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty which it is necessary to make part of our domestic law prior to ratification are in fact made part of Irish law, but the Government has not sought to go any further than is necessary in order to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the amendment to the Constitution approved recently by the people provides that the options and discretions provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam would be exercised by the Government only with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  These would include the provisions for closer co-operation between member states and free movement of persons within the EU, to which I have already referred.  Again in this instance, the Government is keen to ensure that all significant steps to be taken by it under the terms of the Treaty of <Col N="256" /> Amsterdam will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael supports the passing of this legislation.  However, I will table an amendment on Committee Stage for the purpose of teasing out a particular point.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is about more than security or foreign policy issues.  It is concerned with greater equality provisions, employment, fighting crime, improving environmental standards, public health and consumer protection.  In particular I wish to address security related issues.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam European Council did not agree a common defence even though the Maastricht Treaty stated that the Union might in future agree to a common defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence.  Furthermore, Amsterdam sets up blocks and barriers to a common defence and makes it clear that a common defence would require major treaty revisions, including a further intergovernmental conference and ratification by each member state in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. The strange reality is that Irish neutrality will be enshrined in the Constitution for the first time if the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified.  I will return to this point later.</P>
      <P>In three quarters of a century of independence Ireland as a State has played an important role in the world in peace-keeping and, through the United Nations, in advancing the cause of non-nuclear proliferation.</P>
      <P>Twenty five years ago, after half a century of independence, we joined the European Union.  In the last quarter of a century our sovereignty has become a greater reality, not because we chose to stand aside from certain organisations, but because we joined specific organisations, most notably the UN, the Organisation for Security Co-operation in Europe and most, significantly, the European Union.</P>
      <P>Our decision not to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 1949 continues to enjoy wide public support, even though the reasons for not joining have never been enumerated or publicly consented to.  The public is able to discern between membership of NATO and broad security arrangements, on a case by case basis, tailored to our needs and with our full agreement and consent.  MRBI research shows this to be the case as the MRBI &mdash;<i>The Irish Times</i> survey of September 1996 &mdash; indicated.  In my research the only principle on which our neutrality is based, as far as I can ascertain, was set out by Seán McBride, the then Minister for External Affairs, in 1949, when he said Ireland would become a full charter member of NATO the day after partition ends. This is a point I will return to in relation to the British-Irish Agreement later in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cold War is over but international strife continues.  Increasingly this strife is of an internal nature &mdash; such as in the former Yugoslavia and Algeria &mdash; and requires a new response.  There is now a greater emphasis on the need for security, <Col N="257" /> stability and good order as a prerequisite to, for example, humanitarian aid.  The EU does not have the capacity to make this response but the addition of the Petersberg Tasks to its remit will give the EU a greater capacity to help keep the peace.</P>
    <P>The Petersberg Tasks are: humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making.  They provide a framework within which the Western European Union can provide effective support &mdash; including structure and communications &mdash; for implementation of measures for conflict prevention and crisis management, including peacekeeping activities decided by the UN Security Council or by the OSCE and Ireland is a member of both.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam White Paper, Articles 15.51-3 states:</P>
    <P>The EU will avail itself of the Western European Union to elaborate and implement EU decisions on the Petersberg Tasks which have now been brought within the scope of the CFSP.  When it does so, all member states will be entitled to participate fully in the tasks in question.  This is an entitlement &mdash; there will be no obligation on any member state to take part.</P>
    <P>Guiding principles on defence policy discussions were set out in the White Paper on Foreign Policy published by the last Government.  These are:</P>
    <P>4.113 Ireland has argued that the formulation of a common defence policy should take account of the level of political and economic integration achieved by the European Union, be responsive to broader developments in European security, and reflect the varying capacities and experience of the member states.</P>
    <P>4.114 In discussion with the Western European Union of involvement in the &ldquo;Petersberg Tasks&rdquo; and in contributing to discussion of overall defence policy for the Union, the Government will be guided by the following underlying principles &mdash;</P>
    <P>the commitment of successive Irish Governments that when the time came Ireland would be willing to enter into negotiations on a common defence policy for the Union. In line with this Ireland should be a constructive participant in the Intergovernmental Conference on this issue, one which wants to contribute to and influence the outcome, and one which wishes to participate in its implementation</P>
    <P>the common defence policy should have as its primary objective the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security in accordance with the UN Charter and OSCE principles</P>
    <P>the Union's defence policy must be relevant to the broader role of the United Nations which has a unique legitimacy in the area of international peace and security</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> the common defence policy must be situated in the context of a broad approach to security that recognises the crucial contribution to security that can be made by economic progress, the removal of the causes of conflict, the fight against crime and drugs and the protection of the environment</P>
    <P>The defence policy must be compatible with Ireland's continued pursuit of its objectives in the area of disarmament and arms control.  We will continue to work for a reduction in armaments, for the strengthening of non-proliferation regimes, and for an end to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>4.115 The Government has undertaken to put the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum. This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged, unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>That particular quotation and what the White Paper states later relates to the foreign policy issues relevant at the time.  The passing of the British-Irish Agreement by the people of Ireland has opened a new window in the whole area of security and defence relations, and one of which Members may not be aware.  I have no hesitation in welcoming and supporting them.  The White Paper at 4.49 states:</P>
    <P>The overall objectives of Partnership for Peace are consistent with Ireland's approach to international peace and European security, and participation in the partnership could have several important advantages &mdash;</P>
    <P>we would be working together with OSCE partners on programmes of practical co-operation designed to reduce tension and promote overall security in Europe.  We have consistently called for and encouraged the development of such inclusive co-operative security arrangements</P>
    <P>it would enhance the capacity and readiness of our Defence Forces to participate in UN or OSCE peace-keeping operations through training and exercises with countries with which we share a peace-keeping tradition, and thus help us to ensure that Ireland is in a position to continue to make an important contribution in the field of peace-keeping</P>
    <P>it would enable our Defence Forces to make available to European countries which wish to develop their peace-keeping capacities, the benefits and lessons of Ireland's long experience in international peace-keeping operations</P>
    <P>it would enhance Ireland's capacity to carry out search and rescue operations off our coasts and to conduct humanitarian missions in response to national or other disasters</P>
    <P>it would provide a framework for practical <Col N="259" /> co-operation and planning to deal with threats to the environment and drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>Participation in the Western European Union Petersberg Tasks would do the same.  Fine Gael advocates joining Partnership For Peace as well as taking on Petersberg Task type commitments on a case by case basis.  In the past many issues have been beyond reasoned or respectful discussion in this State, something I have repeatedly said in the House and in committees.  Our role in the future security and defence architecture of an evolving Europe remains in this category.  This is unhealthy and wrong.</P>
    <P>Regarding the evolving EU security architecture, every Taoiseach from Seán Lemass to Deputy John Bruton has indicated that, should continued membership of the EU require Ireland to take on security and even defence commitments, they would favour doing so.  It is time the Taoiseach made his position clear.  The Amsterdam Treaty does not entail defence commitments, but an enlarged Union of 26 to 30 countries may revisit the question at a future date.  The purpose of an integrated Union is to ensure peace and stability so that Europe can prosper and there can be no return to the tensions which gave rise to two World Wars in the first half of this century.  As the Union becomes more federal in nature it will take on more of a peacemaking as distinct from a peacekeeping role.  The Petersberg Task commitments of the Western European Union, to be transferred to the EU under the Amsterdam Treaty proposals, is a step in this direction.</P>
    <P>Instability anywhere on the continent of Europe has implications for the stability of the continent as a whole.  However, in the case of Bosnia, it was NATO which was the driving force behind the international peace effort and not the EU, which is the single biggest political and economic bloc in the world.  The EU was confined to issuing démarches while countless numbers of Europeans died in horrific genocide.  However, public opinion in the United States is becoming less supportive of leading such missions abroad. To ensure stability in the long-term, it is inevitable that the EU will develop its peacemaking role.</P>
    <P>Effective peace enforcement without NATO assets is not a realistic concept at the moment. The Western European Union and EU do not have the independent capacity to enforce peace. We must acknowledge that 11 of the 15 EU states are NATO members.  We must learn to respect the fact that individual sovereign states have come together in NATO and, furthermore, all central and eastern European countries wish to join in this alliance.  Nor is it a question of right and left.  Many of those states are led by socialist prime ministers.  The Secretary General of NATO is a socialist.  As part of our preparation to have a credible role in influencing the evolving security architecture in Europe, we must ensure that we <Col N="260" /> are not isolated and irrelevant.  Otherwise the agenda will be completely set by others.  Simply put, if we are not in the game, we cannot make the rules.</P>
    <P>Regarding neutrality, the Maastricht Treaty left open the question of a future possible agreement on a defence policy which might in time lead to a common defence.  The Amsterdam Treaty does not pursue this possibility but sets out the substance of co-operation in the Petersberg Tasks and the method of achieving this. Those who advocated support for the referendum on the British-Irish Agreement while arguing against the Amsterdam Treaty on security, defence or defence policy grounds, may be surprised in time to find that new security arrangements may arise from the totality of relationships in these islands rather than from the EU in the near future.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the strangest thing about the Amsterdam Treaty is that it enshrines neutrality in the Constitution for the first time, at least as far as the EU and the Western European Union is concerned. Ironically, should the State wish to join NATO or, perhaps, some new security arrangement on this island, there would be no constitutional ban after the Amsterdam Treaty.  The enshrining of the British-Irish Agreement in Article 29 of the Constitution provides the necessary constitutional authority for future security or defence arrangements on the island and even between it and Britain.  When the Amsterdam Treaty becomes law, Ireland could not become part of a future common EU defence or full members of the Western European Union without an intergovernmental conference, the unanimous agreement of the European Council, which is the Heads of State or Government, ratification in accordance with our constitutional requirements, since the Single European Act court ruling, and without holding a referendum on the issue.</P>
    <P>This arises because Article J.7 of the Amsterdam Treaty states:</P>
    <P>1.  The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide.  It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</P>
    <P>The Western Europe Union (WEU) is an integral part of the development of the Union providing the Union with access to an operational capability notably in the context of paragraph 2.  It supports the Union in framing the defence aspects of the common foreign and security policy as set out in this Article.  The Union shall accordingly foster closer institutional relations with the Western European Union with a view to the possibility of the integration <Col N="261" /> of the Western European Union into the Union, should the European Council so decide.  It shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain Member States, which see their common defence realised in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.</P>
    <P>The progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as Member States consider appropriate, by cooperation between them in the field of armaments.</P>
    <P>2.  Questions referred to in this Article shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.</P>
    <P>3.  The Union will avail itself of the Western European Union to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.</P>
    <P>The competence of the European Council to establish guidelines in accordance with Article J.3 shall also obtain in respect of the Western European Union for those matters for which the Union avails itself of the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>When the Union avails itself of the Western European Union to elaborate and implement decisions of the Union on the tasks referred to in paragraph 2 all Member States of the Union shall be entitled to participate fully in the tasks in question.  The Council, in agreement with the institutions of the Western European Union, shall adopt the necessary practical arrangements to allow all Member States contributing to the tasks in question to participate fully and on an equal footing in planning and decision taking in the Western European Union.</P>
    <P>Decisions having defence implications dealt with under this paragraph shall be taken without prejudice to the policies and obligations referred to in paragraph 1, third subparagraph.</P>
    <P>4.  The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of close cooperation between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the Western European Union and the Atlantic Alliance, provided such cooperation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this Title.</P>
    <P>5.  With a view to furthering the objective of this Article, the provisions of this Article will be reviewed in accordance with Article N.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> Article N is the Article which provides for an Intergovernmental Conference.  As stated in section 1, actions &ldquo;which might lead to a common defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;the integration of the Western European Union into the Union&rdquo; would require a unanimous decision of the European Council and &ldquo;it shall in that case recommend to the Member States the adoption of such a decision [the same wording is used in both cases] in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements&rdquo; which means a referendum in the case of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a new Article J.13 of the Treaty on European Union, the Maastricht Treaty, is being introduced regarding procedures.  This provision introduces a new Article J.13 which governs the procedure to be followed when adopting measures under this title.  The general rule is that the Council must act unanimously.  However, it may act by qualified majority vote when adopting joint actions or common positions or taking any other decision on the basis of a common strategy and when adopting any decision implementing a joint action or common position.  Two exceptions to this procedure are important.  First, if a member of the Council declares that, for important and stated reasons, it intends to oppose the adoption of a decision, a vote shall not be taken. Second, the procedure shall not apply to decisions having military or defence implications. A simple majority suffices for procedural matters.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of Deputies making outrageous allegations and I want the record to state the facts.  When people read the record I want them to be able to say &ldquo;Yes, that point is supported by the evidence.&rdquo; Before this debate is over, some Deputies will make headline grabbing, outrageous statements.  I am calling on those Deputies to participate in this debate on security, defence and related issues in a civilised and proper way which relates to the facts.  I do not expect everyone to share my view but I object when Deputies make allegations against other Deputies on the basis that we did what we believed to be our duty when supporting the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>Article J.14 of the Treaty on European Union covers agreements with States or international organisations.  This provision introduces a new Article J.14 of the Treaty on European Union, covering the procedure to be followed for the negotiation and conclusion of agreements with states or international organisations in the context of this Title.  The procedure applies similarly to Article K.10 of the Treaty on European Union. Article J.14 states:</P>
    <P>When it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States or international organisations in implementation of this Title, the Council, acting unanimously, may authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission as appropriate, to open negotiations to that effect. Such agreements shall be concluded by the Council acting unanimously on a recommendation from the Presidency.  No agreement shall be binding on a Member State whose representative in the Council states that it has to comply <Col N="263" /> with the requirements of its own constitutional procedure; the other members of the Council may agree that the agreement shall apply provisionally to them.  The provisions of this Article shall also apply to matters falling under Title VI.</P>
    <P>Declaration No. 3, relating to Article J.14 states:</P>
    <P>The provisions of Article J.14 and K.10 of the Treaty of the European Union (Maastricht) and any agreement resulting from them shall not imply any transfer of competence from the Member States to the Union.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of pro-military neutrality campaigners these articles are much stronger provisions than Article J.4 of the Maastricht Treaty which reads:</P>
    <P>(1) The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence.</P>
    <P>(2) The Union requests the Western European Union (WEU), which is an integral part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.  The Council shall, in agreement with the institutions of the Western European Union, adopt the necessary practical arrangements.</P>
    <P>(3) Issues having defence implications dealt with under this Article shall not be subject to the procedures set out in Article J.3.</P>
    <P>(4) The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework.</P>
    <P>(5) The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of closer cooperation between two or more Member States on a bilateral level, in the framework of the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance, provided such co-operation does not run counter to or impede that provided for in this Title.</P>
    <P>(6) With a view to furthering the objective of this Treaty, and having in view the date of 1998 in the context of Article XII of the Brussels Treaty, the provisions of this Article may be revised as provided for in Article N(2) on the basis of a report to be presented in 1996 by the Council to the European Council, which shall include an evaluation of the progress made and the experience gained until then.</P>
    <P>It is clear from comparing Article J.4 of the Maastricht Treaty with Article J.7 of the Amsterdam Treaty that not only does the latter not bring us further into any military alliance, it creates <Col N="264" /> blocks, checks and balances.  If anything it weakens what the Maastricht Treaty hoped to build on.  However, people still claimed that we would be in some defence alliance.  If we are in any security or defence alliance in the near future it is more likely to result from the British-Irish Agreement than anything agreed in Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>The essence of the new Article J.7 is that actions of the European Council which might lead to a common defence, only if recommended by them unanimously, would have to be adopted by member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  Furthermore, should the possibility of the integration of the Western European Union into the Union be agreed by the European Council, which would again have to be by unanimity, it would have to be ratified by each member state in accordance with its constitutional requirements.  With a view to furthering the objective of this Article, the provisions of the Article will be reviewed in accordance with Article N at some time in the future. This means a further intergovernmental conference before any changes can be recommended unanimously by the European Council to the member states.</P>
    <P>Any claim that the Amsterdam Treaty in any way weakens our traditional military neutrality is untrue.  For the first time it copperfastens neutrality in the Constitution in terms of European Union membership until the people decide otherwise. This is my interpretation of what is included in the Articles.  I am putting forward this view after the referendum campaign because I am not trying to persuade anyone.  If anyone does not believe this to be the case let them indicate where I am wrong.  If we are to debate these issues then let us do so rationally and reasonably.  Fine Gael welcomes these provisions.  If there is to be a departure from our traditional policy at any stage in the future then this should be by decision of the people, following the agreement of the Government and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>A full consideration of the extent of current moves towards further European integration must include an examination of EMU, agreed in the Maastricht Treaty, as well as the Amsterdam Treaty.  EMU is aimed at creating a single currency &mdash; the euro &mdash; for those member states wishing and able to take part in the project.  The main economic benefits of EMU are considered to be removal of exchange rate uncertainty and costs in trade, investments and tourism, the estimated transaction and hedging costs to business in the EU is over $16 billion US dollars per annum; convergence of interest rates among member states which participate; a deepening and enhancement of the single market; an affirmation of the European identity in international relations &mdash; in time the EU should be able to punch its weight and a strengthening of collective discipline, especially in the fight to control inflation.</P>
    <P>A single currency will mean that participating member states will cease to have their own currency <Col N="265" /> and will not be able to devalue in the event of an economic shock.  However, the alternatives to EMU are not cost free.  For example, a disintegrating Europe, which would almost certainly follow the abandonment of the EMU project, would have serious implications for employment.  In any event, devaluation is only a short-term solution to underlying problems of competitiveness which must be addressed in the long-term.  This is the real lesson we must learn: prepare now by becoming more productive and more competitive in use of manpower, materials, energy and general cost control.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty sets out criteria which each member state wishing to qualify for membership of EMU must meet.  In this further stage of integration and adoption of a single currency, we must also consider the other supports that exist for member states.  A ceiling of 1.27 per cent of a European Union budget would not meet the requirements which could arise from, for example, an asymmetric economic shock to a member of EMU.  This matter needs to be given greater priority.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, the ERSI indicated clearly that, on balance, it is in our interest to join EMU and we should be committed to it.  The Amsterdam Treaty is a further step on the road to ensuring that what happened in the first half of this century, when 60 million Europeans killed each other, will not happen again.  The integration process is not about assimilation, it is about learning to live together &mdash; British, Irish, French, Germans, Catholics, Protestants and non-believers &mdash; and ensuring peace and stability for continued prosperity.</P>
    <P>While I will raise a question on Committee Stage about section 2, I support the Bill and hope it has an easy passage through both Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of Deputy Spring, I will inevitably lean more towards the part of the treaty that affects the areas for which I have responsibility.  I first want to take up a point made by the Minister of State who said: &ldquo;Some commentators have claimed that the result of the referendum represented a victory for opponents of the treaty and of continued European integration, but the Government rejects this claim&rdquo;.  While I welcome this forthright statement, I do not agree with its construction or conclusion. It would be foolhardy to ignore the circumstances and context in which the Amsterdam Treaty was debated.  Some would put it more bluntly by claiming people were inclined to glaze over matters relating to the treaty prior to the referendum and, worse still, after the referendum were inclined to say it is something we should ignore.  In the week prior to the referendum, I recall a reverend gentleman in my constituency of Galway West very enthusiastically, and with admirable sincerity, saying, &ldquo;Whatever you do, vote on the Northern Ireland agreement, but as to the other one, make up your own mind&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this because we are not in the business <Col N="266" /> of frustrating the will of the people by rejecting the Bill on Second Stage.  It is foolhardy for commentators to claim the opponents have had a victory They have not.  There is, however, a problem about discussing Europe in Ireland, in Britain and in most European countries which has some basis.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Mitchell's thoughtful contribution and I agree that the text of Article J in the Amsterdam Treaty, as a transition from Maastricht, is a strengthening of the protections critics have sought, but I will not dwell on that at this stage.  I want to deal with the reason for the low poll in the referendum.  The poll in Galway West, the lowest in the country, is not a record of which we are proud.  The turnout was approximately 48.9 per cent.  That was a tragedy in terms of the opinions that were necessary on the British-Irish Agreement, but it is now a matter of history. I want to consider what has gone wrong with the European debate.</P>
    <P>Those who spoke in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty did not address the general disquiet about the debate on Europe regressing to a debate on a common market, that it was not a debate about a Europe of citizens and that treating about accession was treating about enlarged markets rather than a further unification of peoples.  Issues of cultural diversity and citizenship were neglected and the language used was a dead one. One could convincingly show that there had been comprehensive bad faith from the moment the President of the Commission and the President of the Parliament made their great rhetorical phrases about constructing a Europe of the citizens. Those speeches which preceded the Irish Presidency of the European Union, and to which the Irish Presidency sought to give some depth, seemed to have receded.  The speeches made by uncritical enthusiasts before, during and after the treaty, placed far more emphasis on building an economic, competitive power to the United States and Japan than on constructing a Europe of citizens.  For example, the founding European treaties are singular in their total exclusion of any reference to culture.  The first reference to culture is in Article 128 of the Maastricht Treaty.  Any person seeking to advance a legal dimension to this would have to rely on Article 128.4 and even that is very weak.  It simply suggests that culture must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Lest people suggest that is exactly what one would expect from people who are not real Europeans, unfortunately this neglect has immense economic implications which the President of the Commission recognises.  The world audio-visual industry is worth $176 billion, of which the United States has 51 per cent and Europe has 30 per cent.  It is equally interesting to note that in terms of the flow of audio-visual products into the European Union, America comes second. When an impasse was reached at the World Trade Organisation talks on this specific point, the negotiations foundered on a fundamental principle.  Were audio-visual products, which <Col N="267" /> include film, documentaries and other such matters, simply commodities like vegetables, tinned beans, bread or potatoes and were they much more than that?  Were they not cultural expressions?  Hence, the French position, which I supported during my time in office, in the WTO talks stressed the cultural exception, the idea being that things that expressed one's story or aspects of people's lives were not simply commodities. There were a whole set of consequences which flowed from that.  For example, if they were not commodities, they had to be taken into account by wider considerations than simply competition and the marketplace.  Hence, in the WTO these matters were left unresolved and there was a great deal of pressure on the European Union to concede.</P>
    <P>In 1995 a briefing document was leaked which suggested that a briefing document to the United States negotiators stated they should not get stuck on culs-de-sac about culture, but rather stress the introduction of new services.  The document continued along those lines, the idea being that Europe could be seduced into the view that by becoming bigger it could compete more effectively. This is germane to what has gone wrong and the context in which the referendum took place.  A process of deregulation, mostly focused on the State sector, was begun as part of becoming a big competitor in economic terms, able to handle competition from Japan and the United States.  People heard about the necessity of having regulators in place.  Here there was a green paper on convergence in the telecommunications industry. At the same time there was a complete neglect of the spirit of the treaties.</P>
    <P>If I was a free marketeer, which I am not, and purely in favour of competition I would see the Commission had broken its own terms in relation to competition.  For example, the draft directive on concentration of ownership, originally produced by Commissioner Monti, was abandoned following opposition from two other commissioners. As recently as in the past six weeks, the Commission said there will be no prescriptive directive in this area.  Rather, a directive will be based on the principles of moral suasion.  People were being asked to remove State obstacles in the way of creating a big, effective economic bloc, while at the same time to be supine in handing aspects of European life over to an oligopoly and monopoly which is internationally structured.</P>
    <P>On explaining during the referendum how one system of regulation after another had to be put in place moderate and very interested people said to me they did not think they were voting for all this.  We explained the audio visual growth of 69 per cent between now and 2005 which will come entirely from paid television services, most of which will be imported from the United States. In Britain, for example, a deficit of £163 million has replaced a surplus of £161 million.  The reason for this is that £300 million is exactly the value of <Col N="268" /> what BSkyB purchases from the United States for its new services.</P>
    <P>The European Union is increasing its size in economic terms and removing State obstacles, but at the same time is not taking any action on the issue of defending competition abroad.  There is a fundamental dishonesty &mdash; I use the word very carefully &mdash; in the Commission.  There are three commissioners, namely, the commissioner with responsibility for new services, who is following an agenda which might as well have been written by the United States, the commissioner with responsibility for competition and Commissioner Marcelino Oreja who has responsibility for culture and whose views are largely ignored.</P>
    <P>The discourse about Europe before, during and after the referendum was heavily, supinely and dishonestly economic in so far as it was not prosecuting competition in terms of any limitation on concentration of ownership.  For example, on the issue of convergence on the telecommunications industry, the green paper completely fudged the distinction between convergence of technology, convergence of markets and convergence of content. It almost did not matter what people saw, listened to or read.  All that mattered was size and the public is beginning to see a powerful regression to a rather crude, old-fashioned and not very theoretically sophisticated economic model.  People said to me on the doorsteps that they were unsure about this and did not think it was what they voted for.</P>
    <P>It was equally wrong of those who genuinely opposed some principles of the two previous treaties to simply use them in arguing against the Treaty of Amsterdam which, of course, sought to have some very good aspirational sections in relation to workers' rights, the environment, the sharing of information, co-operation in relation to the elimination of certain types of crime and a social agenda which was welcome, even if it was a little loose.  I preferred the White Paper on the treaty, which outlined these issues, than the final explanations on offer before the vote.</P>
    <P>The issue in this period between the people having expressed their viewpoint and it passing into domestic law is how we can most valuably use the debate.  We should reflect on the current atmosphere about debate in Europe.  It is also very important to realise that the great institutional reform which has been promised has not happened.  If anything, there has been a regression in relation to the quality of the language used in explaining the European Union.  It is a fallacy to suggest all that is needed is a printing press and the provision of more information, that citizens will become more enthusiastic if they get more information.  However, this is not the issue. The issue is the loss of trust, of belief in a vision and of authenticity in people making the case for a bigger and wider Europe.  It is important that these matters are placed on the record in the context of the Minister's speech.  Those who propose to take part in the European elections, as candidates or participants in the debate, better gird <Col N="269" /> themselves for the fact that the citizens of Europe will not welcome silence on these issues.</P>
    <P>Of great importance is the issue of balance between culture and the economy.  We are heading for disaster if we continue to neglect the cultural component.  It was significantly important to be included as a reserve item in the World Trade Organisation debate.  However, there will be further debate as the cultural space of Europe is wider than the economic space.  It includes the 18 million unemployed people, the employed and migrants within the Union.  If we are to suggest the economy is a sealed off separate entity to the totality of the institutions of Europe and its other social forms, we are heading for growth rates which will be coupled with the most massive, divisive confrontations, in the context of immigrants, the unemployed, the socially excluded and a new group, namely, those excluded from information in an information society.</P>
    <P>The ninth protocol of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which relates to public service broadcasting, represents an Irish influence.  It sought to provide for investment in public service broadcasting and was a real achievement.  I do not wish to stray from the Bill, but the protocol is very important. It concerned the nature of public service broadcasting which sought to educate, inform and entertain and carried a responsibility of universal access, diversity of cultural form, plurality of editorial opinion and all the things which fit easily with citizenship.  The protocol constitutes a journey in the direction of a Europe for citizens. However, this debate is being lost.</P>
    <P>Even within the existing framework there is a need to restore or, more accurately, establish a parity between the components of the Commission in developing and administering the treaties.  I already mentioned the three Commissioners with responsibility for culture, new services and the Internal Market.  I am angry at the manner and arrogance of the Internal Market in the context of the regular downgrading of proposals from the Commission regarding cultural considerations.  It is from cultural consideration that the theory of citizenship is derived.  This is referred to weekly in the articles which speak about distinctiveness and a Europe which incorporates different stories. That provides the best possible approach to dealing with accession.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I witnessed patronising, insulting and degrading meetings with applicant countries and I hope I managed to help put a stop to that. During the French Presidency, applicant countries were asked to stay on at the end of a Council meeting at which they produced lists of everything they had deregulated, privatised, the number of radio and television licences which had been issued and so on.  It was humiliating to witness the destruction of countries' various cultural forms and listen to people telling the Council how rapidly they were becoming what it wanted them to be.  Such a scene did not represent a relationship between people who were building a Europe <Col N="270" /> of the citizens.  That kind of prosecution of economic interests, coupled with rhetoric about no more war and everyone living in peace and harmony, will not be acceptable into the future.  It will be necessary to prove how issues of citizenship and the cultural component have been dealt with, whether there has been a willingness to do anything about Article 128.4 in the Maastricht Treaty and what purposes will be made of the ninth protocol.  In regard to the ninth protocol, my successor has stated it is not something which requires any great action, merely something that must be taken account of.  That attitude will be the rock on which European enthusiasts will perish. The protocol was included in the treaty by people like me who believed in public service broadcasting, diversity, universal access and citizenship. We refused to regard all these things as commodities and did not want to be dominated by a product over which we would not have any control.  There was an element of bad faith in regard to these issues which was reflected in a low turnout in the recent referendum and which will wreak disaster unless these issues are honestly addressed.</P>
    <P>The European treaties must be construed in their totality but all of the available evidence is that they are not.  The Amsterdam Treaty at least attempts to address a Europe of workers; it boldly recognises the 18 million unemployed and seeks to give rights to employed and unemployed alike.  It also seeks to put an end to old obstructionist, conservative, anti-worker philosophies. These are things the member states could achieve together.  The Amsterdam Treaty was carried, admittedly with a low majority.</P>
    <P>I notice that many people who opposed the social charters implicit in the Amsterdam Treaty are now coming out of the woodwork.  I refer to such people as the &ldquo;cheap labour theorists&rdquo;.  They believe that once the largest pigs at the trough have taken their swill, there is something wrong with growth rates continuing if the profits are to distributed among the lower paid.  They also think there is something wrong with an economy which does not produce a large pool of unemployed people in order that wage rates can be depressed. It is so much more attractive for such economists to speak of a labour supply curve in which more people would be available for work and low wages could be offered to them.  It would be outrageous, in their view, to even suggest the payment of a minimum wage as it would interfere with the market for labour.  Such views did not last 24 hours anyway because, following the initial total opposition to tax cuts which was expressed, a beautiful academic backstep occurred with talk of tax cuts above the middle line and so on. Offensive phrases such as the one &ldquo;Joe six pack&rdquo; coined by Moore McDowell were used and Brendan Walsh rushed in practically urging us to hold a national conference because the growth in the economy could not possibly last.  Such attitudes are offensive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> This is a Parliament and we, as parliamentarians, are responsible for the totality of things. The economy is merely one dimension of our responsibilities.  I, and others who share my political views, see the economy as instrumental in achieving certain social objectives and political options.  We do not see ourselves as semi-literate &ldquo;Joe six packs&rdquo; at a remove from the economy. There seems to be an attitude that we should be kept out of the economy as if we were yobbos likely to cross the fence and interfere with it.  The economy is viewed as a physical entity which can heat up and cool down and we are merely meant to wonder how it is progressing from the sidelines. It is as if it did not matter that income gaps have widened and people are suffering desperately from social exclusion, unemployment, bad housing and differential access to health services and so on.</P>
    <P>As someone who had serious questions about previous EU treaties I could not, and did not want to, impute those reservations to the Amsterdam Treaty.  Turning the provisions of the treaty into realities will pose a very real challenge.  The treaty recognises the need for social policy and protections at work and the need for environmental and ecological responsibility.  I want to participate in a debate about a bigger Europe.  I am very worried about the capacity of any such debate to have the necessary ring of authenticity about it. People do not merely want to be told that in the event of a future war, we would be able to defend ourselves.  They want more than that.  They want to feel part of a Europe in which people's best versions of themselves will be to the forefront. They want a Europe in which diverse opinions will be shared patiently and want to feel there are things we can do together in a positive environment.</P>
    <P>The treaty refers to arms sales but it does not go far enough.  Those who are strongest in Europe speak about the importance of building peace but when one considers the balance sheets of these Governments reveal they make a great deal of money from the production and sale of armaments, such statements ring very hollow indeed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that nobody has yet embarked on self-congratulation in this debate. When Ireland first joined the EU, I was part of a deputation to Europe.  One member of the deputation began his speech by saying Ireland was a small country but a proud one.  It was possible predict the subsequent content of the speech quite easily, having heard that.  One often hears a chorus of people in the Dáil saying how well we have done from Europe and how grateful we should be, a sort of pathetic &ldquo;we'd be grateful if your Lordship could give us a little more for the potatoes&rdquo; attitude.  We must construct a positive agenda about Europe, one which will accelerate the direction of the Amsterdam Treaty in terms of deepening the social discussion.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper on technological convergence <Col N="272" /> has been described by some academics, whose opinions I would respect, as disgraceful.  It is a technical document which does not refer to content and fails to deal adequately with the convergence of markets.  It adopts a &ldquo;Willie Wonka chocolate factory&rdquo; view of technology pointing out the various exciting developments which have occurred in televisual, telephonic and other forms of technology.  The view is to the effect that there should be no holding back.</P>
    <P>The interpretation of the totality of the treaties is important.  A parity of treatment of culture, the economic and the social is also important.  The context in which the recent referendum has to be critically examined in terms of what is missing from the discourse is significant.  The agenda of a Europe of citizens must take precedence over the negative elements in the treaty.  The meaning of European integration and accession has to be extended to include a greater respect for accession countries.  The absence of reference to participation in the cultural form must be addressed.  As an illustration, convergence has to be moved from the technical to deal with the content. We must get back to the spirit of the original White Paper and try to rediscover the philosophy that can carry the treaty onwards.</P>
    <P>I accept that the case for a constitutional referendum on any change in our military neutrality is strengthened rather than weakened by the treaty. More importantly, we need to get to a point at which Ireland will cease participation in the European Union as part of its partnership internationally. I welcome the initiative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to nuclear proliferation and our participation in the wider agenda.  Anything we do should not be at the price of our commitment to the United Nations or the development of a stronger United Nations. For that reason we must have an informed debate on security and defence and we must also begin to address the causes of war and conflict and their elimination.</P>

      <P>This is a short technical Bill to give effect in domestic law to the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty which affect the European Community Treaties and the European Court of Justice.  The other provisions in the treaty did not need legislative intervention for reasons outlined by the Minister, Deputy Fahy.  I do not propose to go over that ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past 25 years of European membership has seen a massive increase in prosperity and national self-confidence.  During the past 25 years of European membership, our wealth has climbed from 58 per cent of the European average to well over 90 per cent today.  EU funding has made a significant contribution to our economic success and our improved standard of living.  Access for Irish exporters to the large barrier free European market has made possible rapid economic growth. Ireland's position within the European Single Market has attracted significant inward investment <Col N="273" /> and boosted job creation.  Nobody can doubt that rural Ireland has benefited greatly from the impact of CAP reform.  In addition, EU membership has positively influenced many other aspects of Irish life, including equal pay legislation, environmental protection policy, consumer protection law, health and safety standards and social and educational policies.  The provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty consolidate and enhance the benefits to Irish citizens in those important areas.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty imposed a number of monetary conditions on Ireland as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for membership of a single currency.  There was no social or employment dimension to that treaty. It did not matter what our rate of unemployment was or how many people were living in abject poverty, if we met the monetary targets in terms of our public borrowing requirement not being below X and our debt-GDP ratio being at or below Y, we would qualify.  However, the Amsterdam Treaty attempts to place employment and social inclusion closer to the heart of European policy.  It is true there is no definition of employment in the treaty nor is there any indication of the type or quality of jobs that need to be created.  The treaty also provides that employment policies must conform to economic policies and that increased employment must boost competitiveness. I would have preferred a provision to the effect that competitiveness would lead to employment creation.  I would also have preferred if minimum targets for employment had been clearly set out in the treaty.  Nevertheless, it is a beginning.</P>
    <P>The vote in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty was somewhat less than generally anticipated. That was due no doubt partially due to confusion about its provisions.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Fahy, said, the treaty lacked a central theme of the sort which commands popular attention. It was an amending treaty rather than a stand alone text.  Therefore, it is a difficult document to comprehend in isolation.  However, I suspect there is another explanation.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Michael Higgins said and I agree with much of it.  There are increasing signs across the European mainland that the Euro federalist agenda has peaked and that the impetus towards further European integration has weakened. It is true that EMU will necessitate further economic integration, but the EU citizen's appetite for political integration seems to have significantly diminished.  I am detecting increasing signs on the ground that this attitude has begun to take hold here.  There appears to be an absence of an underlying political will to create a European super state.  The attitude among EU citizens, and increasingly among Irish citizens, is that they prefer confederation to federation.  It will be extremely difficult to sustain the federalist agenda in an expanded European Union.</P>
    <P>The hostility to creating significant centralised power in an expanded European Union arises from the fact that there is no effective system to <Col N="274" /> control those who exercise those powers.  That attitude has been slower to develop in Ireland because of the rancorous debate in the United Kingdom.  The fear of being labelled Thatcherite has prevented many of those in this country who have reservations about Europe from voicing their opinions, but that is changing.  The probability now is that the majority of people throughout the EU prefer a loose confederal Europe of nations in which member states retain their own constitutions, political identities, tax systems, criminal law systems and State rights.  The Irish people in particular cherish their separate identity. I have no doubt that the vast majority of our people would recoil in horror at the notion that their identity would be submerged in a European super state.</P>
    <P>It was said many times during the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty that it has no implications for Irish neutrality and I believe it is necessary to state that again.  I agree with Deputies Mitchell and Higgins that the wording of the Amsterdam Treaty takes Ireland further away from the notion of being involved of military alliances of any sort.  If the treaty had not been passed, our Defence Forces would still continue to take part in peace-keeping, peace enforcement and humanitarian missions.  The only difference the treaty makes in that regard is it enables us to engage in such activities as part of the EU in addition to doing so by virtue of our membership of the UN.  The treaty makes a tentative move towards a common European defence system and a common defence.  However, the question of European defence is extremely complex and hypothetical.  In the long-term common European defence policy involves a certain decoupling from the United States, special consideration for the German position and the question of the British and French nuclear deterrents.  We have barely taken the first step along any of those roads. However, the new procedures incorporated in the Amsterdam Treaty will go a long way towards removing that paralysis of decision-making which effectively prevented the EU from playing any role in the maintenance of world peace and order.</P>
    <P>At the time of the Nazi holocaust other states could claim that they did not know about it, but no such excuse can be advanced regarding the activities of Pol Pot in the killing fields of Cambodia. All of Europe saw the horrors night after night on television, but we were unable to act. Then there was Bosnia and we tried feebly to act, but we failed.  That failure will stand to the eternal discredit of Europe.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the provisions in the treaty which give the European Court of Justice general jurisdiction over third pillar matters of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. While criminal law enforcement in each state will remain the exclusive preserve of that state, this extension of the remit of the Court of Justice will mean that police and judicial co-operation between states is carried out not only with <Col N="275" /> increased efficiency but also with increased protection for human rights.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty represents a small, tentative step along the road to greater European integration.  It seeks to complement rights already in existence in member states while introducing extra measures at EU level to enhance the rights of citizens and to bring the Union closer to its citizens.  Many of its central provisions are still unclear to the vast majority of Irish citizens. However, they will have a profound impact for good on the lives of the people, as will be amply demonstrated in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Michael Higgins's speech was interesting and got to the root of many of the issues we must address.  There is a difference between those who are uninformedly enthusiastic about European union and those who are in favour of the European Union and its evolution but are critical on many occasions of the directions it takes.</P>
      <P>The idea of a confederal versus a federal Europe, put forward by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, should be teased out.  I am not sure he is right in his assertion that a confederal Europe would be better than a federal Europe, despite the current acknowledged absence of a democratic mechanism for controlling decision making in a federal Europe.  One of the critical roles of the European Union is to recover for the citizen power and control over the issues which I call problems without frontiers.  The degradation of the environment, crime, drug trafficking and so forth require European regulation, if not global regulation.  They cannot be dealt with effectively on the basis of co-operation between states because that does not adequately recover for the citizen the democratic power to which the citizen is entitled in relation to these matters.  That debate must be conducted and I hope there will be an opportunity to do so in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House gives effect to the will of the people as expressed in the referendum in May which ratified the Amsterdam Treaty.  The debate on that treaty is over and the people have spoken.  There is little to be gained from going over the issues again.  We now need to look at where the European Union will go after the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of debate on the treaty in this country was disappointing.  To the extent that there was a debate, it tended to focus on the non-issue of neutrality.  I use the phrase &ldquo;non-issue&rdquo; not because neutrality is not important but because it was a non-issue in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty.  Under the terms of the treaty the likelihood of a common defence policy and a common defence force are even more remote.  Those who argued otherwise did a disservice to the treaty. They took the focus away from its real gains in terms of adding a social dimension to the Maastricht <Col N="276" /> Treaty, a treaty I opposed because it did not contain such a dimension.</P>
    <P>That is not to say the social dimension in the Amsterdam Treaty is the end of the process; it is only the beginning.  As Deputy Higgins said, the issue now is implementation of that dimension. It ought to be the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to address the content of the Amsterdam Treaty and how it can be implemented.  In that context, the committee should prepare an agenda of issues to be pursued by this House.  That would develop the role of this Parliament as an initiator of ideas for Government to pursue.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty contains a provision which allows the Council, within the limits of the powers conferred on it by the Community, to take action against discrimination.  This is a new power.  The new article provides that the Council, acting unanimously on a Commission proposal and after consulting the Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>Once the treaty is in place it is possible and probably likely that the Irish Government will be brought to the European Court for its failure and the failure of previous Governments to put adequate services in place for mentally handicapped people and for the absence of adequate residential care, respite care and assistance for people who are caring for the mentally handicapped 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks of the year.  There is gross discrimination against families who have children with mental handicap and those families, on the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, will have a strong case to take against the Government.</P>
    <P>The poor level of debate on the treaty contributed to a disappointing turnout and to the higher than expected level of &ldquo;no&rdquo; votes.  This reflects a European wide trend of uncertainty and suspicion about where the European Union is and ought to go.  Earlier this week I welcomed the decision at the summit in Cardiff to hold a special summit in Innsbruck to consider ways of bringing the European Union back to its citizens.  There is a role for this Parliament in advance of that summit, through the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Foreign and European Affairs, to address how this Parliament rather than simply the Government believes Europe can be made more relevant to its citizens.  A report should be prepared by the House for presentation to the Government on how we believe the Government should address this issue.</P>
    <P>Further development of the European Union will only be possible with the support and involvement of its citizens.  Increasingly, however, it appears that more and more people regard the institutions of the European Union as remote and lacking any relevance to the daily problems they face in their lives.  Concern that already existed about this problem was intensified by the significant <Col N="277" />&ldquo;no&rdquo; votes in the referendums in Ireland and Denmark on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>There is significant evidence, supported not just by anecdotal experience but by opinion poll findings, that many of those who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum in this country did so not because they opposed an item in the treaty but because they did not understand it and were unsure of the likely impact of its ratification.  We need to improve the flow of information to the public and also the level of political debate about Europe related issues.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, whose view has been echoed by the European Union movement and others, that part of the problem was that there was no core idea in the Amsterdam Treaty and that this militated against people getting to grips with it.  There were many significant core ideas; what was wrong was that they were not debated in advance of the referendum.</P>
    <P>I accept, as someone who was a member of the Government which helped to negotiate the treaty, that the absence of debate was as much our fault as anybody else's.  As Minister for Social Welfare, I attempted to generate debate.  I spoke to the Irish section of the European anti-poverty movement and a range of other bodies.  I organised conferences on various issues, including social exclusion, but my efforts were inadequate as they did not generate a response.  While the idea of poverty is an old one, the broader concept of social exclusion is a new one and we are only beginning to come to terms with it.</P>
    <P>Since the referendum there has been much comment about the need for greater information on the European Union to increase commitment to it and the turnout at referenda.  As Deputy Higgins said, increasing the turnout of the printing presses is not the answer.  I have long held the view that it is not so much a problem of the absence of information as the lack of debate about the rationale for and the direction of the European Union and the absence of interaction between local, national and European political institutions.</P>
    <P>This House has virtually no role in how European policy is developed from an Irish perspective. There are occasional debates.  We are having this debate because we have to put into law the changes approved by the people in the referendum. There were statements earlier this week on the Cardiff Summit.  There should have been a debate prior to that summit to ascertain the views of the House on the agenda.  The House should have an opportunity to express its view which the Government can accept, if it chooses. This would help to generate knowledge, information and opinions on the direction of the Europe Union.</P>
    <P>There should be a similar debate at local level. There is no reason the democratically elected representatives of the people on county councils, borough corporations and urban district councils <Col N="278" /> should not debate issues relevant to them that arise at European level.</P>
    <P>It is almost a cliché to say that we have to find a way to make the European Union relevant to the citizen.  Despite the good intentions, virtually no progress is being made.  European citizenship is of little value unless it delivers direct and tangible benefits to the citizen.  Part of the problem for people in Ireland is that the European Union lacks a political identity.  The European Parliament appears distant and its proceedings are rarely reported on by the media, unless there is a row about expenses, junkets, the possible loss of funds under the Common Agricultural Policy or an alleged threat to Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, the citizens of every member state face problems without frontiers, including crime, drugs, terrorism and environmental destruction. There is an acceptance and understanding that there is a need for wide, if not global, regulation but we have so far failed to make the connection between that understanding and acceptance and the political mechanisms for making the process more democratic, transparent and participative.</P>
    <P>There is a perception of conflict between a developing European identify or dimension to policy making and implementation and the national identity.  The European identity should be complementary.  We will never build a European identity unless it is perceived to be radically different from the national identity and part of the multiple identity and roles which every citizen has.  We are members of families, localities and nations and have professions as well as social, political and religious commitments, all of which are central to our lives.  If people are to accept a European identity, we must treat Europe's cultural pluralism as an asset, not as a hindrance.</P>
    <P>We must reach the point where the European identity permeates people's lives and daily existence, otherwise they will not support initiatives such as the single currency.  Neither will they support the view expressed by Deputy Mitchell about common defence.  If there is a federal Europe, there will be a common defence but how does one win support among the citizens of Europe for such an idea?  This will only happen if we make the idea of Europe relevant to people's lives and their understanding of who they are.  This must not be exclusive, us against the rest of the world.  It has to be inclusive.  There has been too much exclusivity when it comes to national identity.</P>
    <P>If we do not develop a convincing case for European integration which demonstrates that the project can promote peace, greater prosperity and human values and bring to an end marginalisation, social exclusion and homelessness, it will fail.  If the pressure not only to peg the European budget at its current grossly inadequate level but to reduce it further succeeds, the project will fail because resources will not be available at European level to demonstrate that it is possible to deal with the social and economic issues which affect people's daily lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> There is a need for ongoing debate, not just at times like this, either before or after a referendum. National parliaments should have a more effective role in the decision-making process. There is a need for formal consultation with local authorities and non-governmental organisations. We experimented with this when we negotiated Partnership 2000.  It should be extended to European affairs matters.</P>
    <P>There is a small but significant step we could take to make the Dáil more relevant and that is to bring to an end the pointless ritual in which we engage every six months when statements are made after a European summit at which decisions have been made.  It would be far more logical to discuss the agenda in advance and to give the Dáil a real opportunity to influence the Government's position and thereby the decisions of the summit. There would be a need for statements on the outcomes but on their own they are pointless.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater democracy at European Union level with fewer decisions being made by civil servants and Ministers behind closed doors in Brussels and more being made by the democratically elected Members of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is vital this is done before enlargement takes place.  Part of the problem is self-inflicted.  Too often decisions made by the Commission or the Council of Ministers are seen to be inflexible or illogical.  The decision made in 1991 to abolish duty free sales is a classic example of an EU own goal.  Another potential one is a threat to anti-poverty community and development projects throughout the Community arising from the decision by the Commission earlier this month to freeze funding of £300 million.</P>
    <P>We must now consider where the Community is going in the short and longer term.  A key for issue for Ireland in the coming months will be the Agenda 2000 proposals and the decisions relating to the next round of European funding.  In the longer term we must consider how we can consolidate the gains made in the Amsterdam Treaty and prevent a reversion to the exclusively market driven ethos of Maastricht.  There are likely to be two revisions of the European treaties over the next ten years.  Amsterdam has confirmed what was already evident at Maastricht that the current system for revising the treaties based on diplomatic discussions, culminating in a big bang summit, has failed and must be replaced.</P>
    <P>It is bordering on the suicidal to attempt to widen the Community on the budget proposed in Agenda 2000.  The failure to adequately deal with the budget will set in train a process which will lead to the disintegration of the Union as society demands that member states try to retake control of fiscal and economic levers, probably in vain, hoping to preserve their benefits.  This would be disastrous.  The European project is essential but it must be democratic and have social and cultural dimensions.  It must serve the interests of the citizen and not big business.</P>

      <P>This debate has been useful.  The tragedy is that it did not take place six months or even two years ago.  As many Deputies said, the people were ill prepared for the Amsterdam Treaty which was, by its nature, a complex, multifaceted document.  I agree with Deputy De Rossa that it had many focal points but the valuable aspects in terms of the new ground being broken and the creation of a constitution through the importation of elements into the European treaties were never explained to the people.  There was a failure on the part of everybody in politics in that regard.</P>
      <P>The debate in the lead up to the recent referendum had as its high marks scaremongering, innuendo and half truths.  When one considers all those elements, it is no wonder there was a decline in the willingness of the people to participate and a huge increase in the degree of confusion. Many people to whom I spoke wished to participate in the vote but they were switched off. The tragedy was that the poor turn-out was reflected as indicating a discontent or unwillingness to participate in the decisions on the peace agreement.  We did not treat the citizens of the State with the respect they were due on this matter. We did not prepare the way.  We failed because we should have done so.</P>
      <P>In addition, because of a variety of court judgments, a commission was established to deal with publicity arising from the constitutional referendum. This heaped confusion on top of confusion. There is such a thing as neutral, value free information.  However, some of the material that was trotted out, at the taxpayers' expense, on the pro and con arguments was so artificial that it gave rise to suspicion among the population.</P>
      <P>There were also scaremongering tactics in the debate, such as the argument that neutrality would be affected.  As Deputy Mitchell pointed out, the exact opposite was the case.  There will be additional clarification in international law of Ireland's neutrality and position on military alliances.  Deputies are correct that there has not been a proper debate on what is meant by Ireland's neutrality.  Everybody has a view on neutrality but there has never been a meaningful political debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>What does it mean?  The basic reason Ireland did not become involved in NATO in the postwar period had nothing to do with high-minded ideals.  Sweden, Austria and Finland had real national debates.  In the case of Austria the 1956 state treaty forced neutrality on it.  The settlement with the Soviet Union forced neutrality on Finland and Sweden chose neutrality on the basis of its experience.  However, Ireland chose to stay separate from NATO because six counties were occupied by another state.  This was the reason Ireland adopted a particular stance before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be honest with the people.  There is a need for an informed debate on neutrality.  My view is that Ireland should not become involved in international ventures.  However, our neutrality <Col N="281" /> is not based on any type of intellectual bedrock or honest debate.  This must be acknowledged.  I do not agree with everything Deputy Mitchell said, but the points he put forward are infinitely more honest and based more on principle than the arguments put forward by those who want Ireland to cut itself off from Europe.</P>
    <P>Innuendo was another aspect which destroyed the debate.  Dr. FitzGerald and I took part in an Irish Council of the European Movement information seminar in Arklow and one of the points which astonished me was the extraordinary innuendo injected into the debate by people who considered themselves principled but opposed the issues.  One individual took the trouble to rewrite history in a subsequent letter to <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>As an example of the views which are simmering under the surface, one of the arguments put forward that night was that Ireland needed to vote no to the Amsterdam Treaty because it would give unfettered rights to the Western European Union, which is totally untrue, and would involve Christian soldiers from Ireland attacking Christian Serbs in their religious war with non-Christian forces.  It is bizarre that this level of debate takes place.  This point was not made by a ranting lunatic who had arrived recently from a remote village but by a woman who would consider herself sophisticated.  A person who speaks in nice tones is the most dangerous type of racist.</P>
    <P>The level of debate was based on horrific racist innuendo that because a person has slightly darker skin or does not worship the same God, he or she has less of a right to life.  We must come to grips with this undertone of racism which exists in many debates.  We have been most dishonest in not facing up to it.  A point made by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, resonated strongly with me.  The concept that a self-satisfied, complacent, smug and wealthy Europe has the right to sit on its hands and witness another holocaust within European borders is totally anathema to me.  We had no right as Christian Europeans in the 1930s to sit on our hands and let something odious happen to our fellow humans because they were Jewish.  Equally, we have no right now as Europeans to sit on our hands and allow something equally horrific happen to other Europeans because they are Muslim.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa is correct that neutrality was the great non-issue in the debate.  It was used again, as it was used in 1973 before the original vote to enter Europe, in the Single European Act debate and in the Maastricht Treaty debate.  The only people who can end Irish neutrality are the Irish people.  There is an undertaking across the political spectrum that that matter will be put to a referendum.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa was also correct regarding the social aspects of the Amsterdam Treaty. There has been disenchantment in Europe because citizens of Ireland and elsewhere are subject to a barrage of propaganda about what Europe stands for.  If one listened to that great <Col N="282" /> doyen of Irish political commentators, Mr. Byrne, in the run up to the Amsterdam Treaty referendum, he was given an absolutely unfettered right to promulgate a view on the national airwaves that the Amsterdam Treaty would involve us in EMU, which had already been decided by the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Opinion leaders in the print and electronic media have revelled in pure ignorance as to precisely where we are going and what we intend to do.  We who regard ourselves pro-EU have a responsibility to address the misinformation. Deputy De Rossa pointed out those positive aspects of the treaty which mean he feels he can support this treaty having opposed the Maastricht Treaty.  He mentioned the anti-discrimination measures as well as the rights of workers and consumers. He is correct, but these are aspects of the treaty that were totally ignored, swept to one side or confused in the debate.  They are progressive measures which any rational human being would endorse, but during the debate the anti-discrimination measures were portrayed as a threat to the Irish family and way of life.</P>
    <P>The treaty also recognises the rights of people with disabilities.  For the very first time, there is European recognition that a significant proportion of the people of Europe face significant challenges.  I cannot see how anyone could not welcome that.  However, all of those measures, and others such as provisions regarding the environment and culture, were ignored.  These aspects were sidelined as a result of the bizarre line taken here regarding the responsibilities of political leadership when it comes to informing the public of what is good, bad or indifferent for the State. We have passed responsibility to the judges of the Supreme Court, and, with all due respect to them, they can occasionally make wrong decisions.  The decisions taken by the Supreme Court to neuter political information in these referenda were fundamentally wrong.  The judgment of that court and the response to that judgment would not have been replicated in any other country.</P>
    <P>This issue, arising out of the response to the McKenna and Coughlan judgments, must be addressed.  It is bizarre that when there is virtual unanimity in the political community as to the benefits of a treaty, the Government, which is politically answerable to the public, does not have the right to put the truth forward.  We had the utterly ridiculous situation of a commission, set up with taxpayers' money and employing highly paid civil servants, thinking up entirely spurious arguments against the Amsterdam Treaty.  That was how we attempted to put forward the contra view.</P>
    <P>I am not saying there is no contra view of Europe; there is an honest opposition to Europe and to the federalism of Europe.  I do not agree with it, but it exists and deserves to be put forward in a more meaningful way than some of the trite nonsense trotted out at taxpayers' expense. We need a public debate on where Europe is going, because Europe will develop over the <Col N="283" /> years ahead.  Europe seems remote and is a switch off for many people.  The European Parliament is seen as a gravy train rather than a democratic institution responsible and answerable to the people of Europe while protecting their rights. The lunatic behaviour of some MEPs from time to time does not help with this.</P>
    <P>Ms Patricia McKenna MEP recently called for an end to sheep subsidies.  I accept that the CAP is a piece of licensed madness, but the argument should not be to wipe it out and take income away from a huge proportion of Irish farmers. There should have been an argument on the principles of the CAP, what is wrong with it and why.</P>
    <P>We do not focus on the intellectual challenge of Europe.  We patronise the public, taking the view that the public is not to be informed of the minutae of Europe because it is not interested.  It is not the responsibility of the political establishment, no more than it is that of the media, to titillate people with spurious arguments.  There is a responsibility in politics to recognise that every argument, including the European argument, has two sides.  Those sides must be put forward in a way that challenges people to view those arguments. The Irish media has been extraordinary in this matter, but then it is extraordinary in many other things.  It decides where the high moral ground is, climbs up on it and will brook no alternative argument.</P>
    <P>Europe is rightly seen by many people as being too bureaucratic, too centralist and too remote. This should be addressed, and that is where debate should be focused.  I disagreed with the Minister saying the federal thrust of Europe is gone; I think it has slowed down.  The EU has come a long way since Robert Schuman dropped his famous bombshell by suggesting that a resolution to generations of genocide in Europe could be found in unity.  He argued that there was more in common between the French and Germans than separated them, and that one could control the madness of war by establishing an authority to control coal and steel, and thus weapons. People thought then that that was a daft adventure, but Europe has come a long way since then.</P>
    <P>We must remind ourselves that Europe is about more than grants, which is an obnoxious attitude.  We talk about how many grants we have received.  Europe is about more than money.  The EU has given Europe something more valuable than prosperity in the past 50 years: it has given Europe peace.  That is why much of the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty was, in many ways, a betrayal of the Irish people.  We did not accept that the Irish people can face intellectual arguments and can deal with complex issues.  We have not accepted that there are contra arguments.  I have long accepted that there are many arguments against the European adventure, but those need to be put forward in a way that is based on logic, just as those arguments which favour Europe need to be based on logic.  We must respect alternative views.  To put forward fundamentally <Col N="284" /> racist arguments against Europe is the biggest disservice of all.  The Government has a responsibility to address the lacuna that now exists in the area of information and to rekindle the debate on Europe.  We will return to this issue again very shortly.  As previous contributors said, in the next decade we will return to it at least twice.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility as politicians, as a House of the Oireachtas, and we owe it to the people to initiate a logical well structured debate on what Europe is about, where it is heading and what our role in Europe will be.  We need to get away from the &ldquo;deontas&rdquo; mentality where the only thing Europe means to us is the begging bowl. We need to see that Europe is not just about privilege but also about responsibilities.  As I said in the neutrality debate, I will be always on the side that Ireland should not enter military alliances, but I respect the other viewpoint too. We owe it to ourselves to come to grips with the real issues in this debate and, above all else, to deal with those issues in a way which is fundamental, intellectually challenging and comprehensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I was fascinated to see representatives of the establishment parties coming into the Dáil and refighting the campaign on the amendment of the Constitution some months back and, in the process, denouncing those who opposed ratification by the people of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The major political parties who foisted this agreement on the people have been badly rattled by the almost 40 per cent of the electorate who voted against the ratification of the treaty.  It was a blow to their pride. They had become so used to their word being accepted overwhelmingly by very many people that it came as quite a shock.</P>
      <P>It would be optimistic on my part to expect that they have learned from the experience.  We should reflect on what it meant.  It was extraordinary, that although political parties with enormous resources and representing over 90 per cent of the vote at the last general election unanimously appealed to the people to support the Amsterdam Treaty, a full 40 per cent of the electorate defied them and voted in opposition to it. It is a very strong statement by our people on how we should approach the whole issue of Europe and the structures that are being put in place to dominate Europe over the next period. There is no question but that the issue of the military plans for Europe was central to the unease that brought so many people to vote against the treaty.  The people were not convinced by the right-wing political parties who told them they had nothing to fear.  Clearly the people's judgment was much more advanced than that of many of our politicians.  This is a question on which we will keep a very close eye over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who opposed the ratification of the <Col N="285" /> Amsterdam Treaty never said that ratification would mean an immediate military adventure or something of that nature.  What we said was that it was part of a process of the EU moving to have a military wing so that it could stand alongside, for example, the United States and, as well as having economic muscle, have military muscle to impress those outside the borders of the EU with whom the EU wanted to do business.  The legitimate fears that people had about that development was reflected in the result of the referendum.</P>
    <P>The other thing that features largely in people's minds is that they see more and more decisions that have real effects on their lives being taken out of their hands and out of the hands of the political establishment over whom they have some kind of control in that the Government of the day and the political parties have to go back to the people for election.  More and more fundamental decisions are being made in such a way that the people have no control.  There are many examples of that.</P>
    <P>There have been disturbing trends in that regard in recent times in the market economies of Europe and the world.  One such example is the genetic engineering of plants, crops and animals, and the production for mass markets, for mass profits for multinationals, of genetically modified foodstuffs for animals and humans. Without reference to the Irish people, the EU has allowed this development.  It has allowed United States based multinationals like Monsanto to import huge quantities of genetically modified foodstuffs for animals and humans into the EU. That is before the Irish people had any opportunity for a debate in regard to a very crucial, even sinister, development that will have a serious impact in many spheres of our lives in future.  This type of new technology, which contains within it the most serious dangers, could be foisted on our people by faceless people in the EU.  Such trends are another reason people put down a marker in regard to the recent referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I warn the main parties that make up this Dáil that if they continue to ignore the fears of our people, they will regret it, because people see what is going on.</P>
    <P>Another issue that will arise in the next few months and years is that of EMU and the euro. Again the main political parties are suffering delusions of grandeur in regard to how this economy can hold up in comparison with the other economies in the EU.  The propaganda of the past years about the so-called Celtic tiger has gone to the heads of the political leadership of the main parties.  They have allowed themselves to be deluded into thinking that, because of a few years of relatively good growth, this small economy can drive in the same lane as the powerful German and French economies.  The political leadership of this State is getting carried away, like a small boy suddenly being admitted into the company of the bigger fellows and thinking he is a great man. <Col N="286" /> It will be brought down to earth in a few years from now when reality hits home.</P>
    <P>People should learn from the disastrous situation in south-east Asia.  Before the Celtic tiger came on stream we had the same propaganda in the journals of international financiers and economists about the tiger economies of Asia.  These miraculous economies were forging ahead in terms of growth rates, etc., but now everything has turned to ashes and the poor people in those countries have been left to carry the can.</P>
    <P>I remind our political leaders that many of the features that underpinned the development of the so-called Asian tiger economies are similar to those that underpin the current growth in the Irish economy.  The intervention of the multinational companies is a common feature as well as high levels of indebtedness and more recently, as we have seen here, the enormous increase in property and house prices.  I refer to them as the obscenities in the housing market where homes are put beyond the reach of ordinary working people by virtue of the activities of racketeers in the building and development industries.</P>
    <P>Those activities were a similar feature of the economies of south-east Asia.  The cycle of capitalism will always reassert itself and the boom will turn to bust.  The cycle will turn for the Irish economy also and we will find that attempting to play with the EU big boys is a different story, as the real underlying weakness of the economy comes into play.  By that time, however, the political establishment on both sides of Dáil Éireann will have tied us into rigid economic and monetary structures and our traditional methods of wriggling out of economic crises will be denied our policy makers because we will be tied into the currencies of the major countries.  For example, we will be unable to devalue as a possible mechanism and we will be tied into fixed interest rates, etc.  The smaller economies of the EU such as Ireland and Portugal will face disaster and I have no doubt that, some years from now, this whole experiment will come apart.</P>
    <P>There has not been any real debate on this issue from our political leadership.  That is a shame because they are going into this process blindfolded and hoping everything will work out on the day.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> In the time remaining to me I will try to educate the Minister of State on this matter because Members of this House constantly misunderstand the position. The totalitarian states of eastern Europe are not the model I advocate.  They were not democratic socialist states concerned about the interests of the people but totalitarian gangster states.  I was <Col N="287" /> one of the people who predicted their demise 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>The alternative to the centralisation of the European capitalist economies is not to put more distance between ourselves and Europe but to have a unity of the ordinary working people of Europe, not of the conglomerates, the multinationals and the ruthless people who currently dominate this area.  We must have a unity of people and an exchange of techniques, knowledge, culture, etc.  on a European basis.</P>
      <P>We can create an economy that will serve all the people of Europe and, in the process, outlaw the racketeering and profiteering that puts one of the most basic necessities, a home, out of the reach of most people.  We must utilise the resources democratically and, freed from the grip of the profiteers and the multinationals, we will create a society in which all our people can have a reasonably comfortable lifestyle and freedom of expression.  That is the democratic and socialist Europe to which I aspire.  When the dreadful experiment we are now embarking upon comes unstuck, these ideas will come forward.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The statements made last week on the EU Cardiff Summit, to which some Deputies referred, serve as a reminder that we must focus on EU affairs on an ongoing basis and not just at times of constitutional change arising from developments in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Our business today, however, is technical in nature and limited in scope.  It is a question of providing an Irish law using the framework of the European Communities Act, with which we have been familiar since 1972, for certain provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty to have direct effect.</P>
      <P>This is technical legislation and, consequently, much of the comment that has been made, while interesting, is not relevant.  I am always interested to hear what Deputy Joe Higgins has to say and I respect his point of view, but I believe the process of European integration is democratic and socialist.  While I agree with the Deputy that there are aspects of this development which are less than satisfactory &mdash; he referred to multinationals &mdash; his alternative is not the way forward.  Events in eastern Europe in recent years are a salutary lesson.  The democratic system is the best one for the administration of the new Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for his comments and note his views on common foreign and security policy.  Our business today, however, is to debate the provisions of the Bill, not those of the treaty. There is not much point going back into the debate on the treaty.  The common foreign and security provisions of the treaty are not dealt with in the Bill.  The Deputy referred to EMU, but the Amsterdam Treaty does not deal with EMU and thus developments relating to EMU are not relevant <Col N="288" /> to debate on this Bill.  However, the Deputy's comments are noted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael D. Higgins, as usual, made very interesting comments, but they are perhaps more appropriate to another debate at another time.  While his comments are noted with interest &mdash; I agree with many of them, as I always do &mdash; they are not specific to the legislation we are dealing with today.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to discrimination. Ireland is not in breach of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty which provide for the Union to take measures to combat discrimination in circumstances where all member states so agree.  Consequently, I do not agree with the Deputy's comments in that respect.</P>
    <P>This is tight, technical legislation and I commend it to the House.</P>

The changes made to these articles, however, by the Treaty of Amsterdam are not changes of substance and I will explain the reason.  The changes are as follows. Article N of the Treaty on European Union deals with amendments to that Treaty.  The change made to Article N by the Treaty of Amsterdam consists simply of removing the requirement to hold the 1996 intergovernmental conference.</P>
      <P>The change made to Article O by the Treaty of Amsterdam deals with who may apply to become a member of the Union and how this shall occur.  As with previous enlargements, in the event of further states becoming members of the Union, an accession treaty would be negotiated and in due course ratified by Ireland.  At that future stage the European Communities Act, 1972, would again be amended to take account of the changed membership. The change to Article S provides that the Finnish and Swedish language versions of the treaty shall be authentic.  This has been provided for by the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1994, which dealt with the accession of Finland and Sweden to the EU.</P>

      <P>As I already explained in responding to a number of questions in the past, the outcome of the review which I carried out was presented to Government in the form of an <i>aidemémoire.</i> As the Deputy will know from his period in office, it is not the practice to publish formal ministerial submissions to Government.</P>
      <P>I will, however, make the substance of what emerged from the review of the scheme, together with all the statistical and other information which was appended to the <i>aide-mémoire</i>, available for circulation in the Official Report.  This information is essentially what was extracted from the case files during the review.  I am not, however, in a position to release information which would either involve a breach of Cabinet confidentiality, disclose confidential legal advice from the Attorney General to this or previous Governments, potentially affect our international relations or, in accordance with long standing practice, breach the understanding of confidentiality with which individuals have dealt with my Department.</P>

      <P Just="Center">Summary</P>
      <P Just="Center">Review of Investment based Naturalisation Scheme</P>
      <P Just="Center">10 February 1998</P>
      <P>The Scheme was intended to assist the then IDA in attracting inward investment especially in attracting manufacturing industry.  The introduction of such a Scheme had been advocated by successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce throughout the 1980s but opposed by successive Ministers for Justice on policy grounds.</P>
      <P>In April 1989, the then Minister decided to seek Government approval in relation to a particular proposal which involved a large number of applications.  The Government decided that the applications should be approved and, furthermore, so should future applications for anybody who was prepared to invest in the State.</P>
      <P>Around this time, a Statement of Intent (Appendix A) was made available to persons who enquired about naturalisation linked to investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the period 1988 to 1994, the range of investments made under the Scheme widened <Col N="292" /> from industrial development (which appears to have been envisaged during the early days of the Scheme) to include, for example, some property and forestry development and the shipping sector. In this period, 66 investors (plus 39 spouses and children) were naturalised.  By and large, the main elements of the Statement of Intent were complied with.  Details are set out in tabular form at Appendix B.</P>
    <P>The guidelines at Appendix C were introduced in 1994 and have been followed since; 29 investors (plus nine spouses and children) have been naturalised since the introduction of these guidelines. In general, the provisions of the terms of reference have been complied with.  Details are set out in tabular form at Appendix D.</P>
    <P>Details of the various areas of industry involved are charted at Appendix E.</P>
    <P>On 4 September 1996 the Government decided that no new applications should be accepted pending the introduction of specific legislation, while processing of existing applications could continue.  On 11 March 1997 the Government decided that 19 cases on hand at 4 September 1996 were to be regarded as cases where commitments had been made while 50 other cases were to be left over until legislation was in place.</P>
    <P>On 6 May 1997, despite the decision of 11 March, the Government decided that additional applications should be accepted in respect of three companies.  Again, on 25 June 1997 the Government decided that a further application should be accepted in respect of a fourth company and approved the substitution of an application for investment in a particular company where the original investor had withdrawn.</P>
    <P>On 2 September 1997 the Government decided that further consideration of the Scheme should be deferred pending a report which would be submitted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On 14 October, the Government decided that the decision taken by the previous Government on 25 June to process an application should be implemented.  The Minister approved the application and procedures were still being finalised on 10 February 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in reply to a Dáil Question that, pending the review which the Government - on 2 September 1997 - asked him to carry out, he would not be considering any of the cases which remained to be finalised.</P>
    <P>There are a small number -five- of older cases which had been approved by Ministers prior to September 1996 which have still not been completed and may never be as the applicants no longer appear to be interested.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that applications will be received from the dependants of some investors who have themselves been naturalised.  It is not possible to quantify the numbers of such applications but eight such applications were on hand on 10 February 1998.  Overall, 143 persons (48 of whom are spouses and minor children of investors) have been naturalised on foot of this Scheme, with investment in excess of £90 million <Col N="293" /> having been made.  It is difficult to say precisely how many jobs have been created/preserved but the information available suggests that the figure is in the thousands.</P>
    <P>Regulation of a scheme of this kind is very difficult for various reasons &mdash; checking character references for persons who have never lived in Ireland, checking whether the persons concerned have, in fact, honoured the undertaking to spend 60 days in Ireland in the two years after naturalisation, and inability to take any effective action against persons who might not honour their commitments regarding residence.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform could ascertain the following are countries which do give citizenship in return for investment or direct payments to Governments: St Christopher and Nevis, Tonga, Belize and Panama.  It is understood that in 1994 the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay and the Bahamas operated similar arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the view that the Scheme, as constituted, should not be re-established.  Failure to re-establish the Scheme would not affect the situation of any wealthy individuals who wish to live in Ireland, perhaps invest in business and apply for naturalisation under existing law.</P>
    <P>In so far as the applications accepted for processing by the previous Government in advance of the proposed legislation are concerned, the Minister is of the view that, in the light of the legitimate expectations of those involved and in the interests of those employed in the entities concerned, these applications should be processed to finality.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister sought approval to announce the Government decision by way of a press statement and this was agreed.  The press statement which issued is at Appendix F.</P>

      <i>Statement of Intent</i>
    </P>
    <P Just="Center">(in relation to the exercise by the Minister for Justice of his discretion under section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, to waive the provisions of section 15(c) of the Act in the case of persons establishing certain businesses in the State).</P>
    <P>The Minister will accept as fulfilling the requirements of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; in section 16(a) the guidelines set out in (a), (b) and (c) hereunder so as to grant an application which does not comply with the condition at 15(c) of the Act, but only that condition.</P>
    <P>(a) The applicant will have acquired a residence in the State, will have been resident in the State for two years and will have spent a reasonable amount of time here over the two years.</P>
    <P>(b) The Minister will be satisfied, on the <Col N="294" /> advice of a Minister of the Government, that the applicant has established a manufacturing or international services or other acceptable wealth and job creating project here that is viable and involves a substantial investment by the applicant.</P>
    <P>(c) All other requirements of the Act have been complied with.  (Copies of sections 15 and 16 of the Act are attached).</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1) &ldquo;Residence&rdquo; for the purpose of paragraph (a) involves the establishment here of a residence consistent with the circumstances of the applicant and any of his family allowed to reside here by law and in which he (they) have their home.  The question as to whether any accommodation is or is not a &ldquo;residence&rdquo; will be decided on the criteria applicable to the grant of naturalisation generally and the decision of the Minister thereon shall be final.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purposes of &ldquo;a reasonable amount of time here over the two years&rdquo; in (a) the minimum number of days acceptable would be 60.</P>
    <P>(3) The &ldquo;project&rdquo; referred to at (b) will be one resulting from the applicant's investment and which would not otherwise have occurred.</P>
    <P>(4) The application may include a spouse and children under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>4.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 15 of the Act of 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of naturalisation, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant the application, if satisfied that the applicant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)s of full age;</P>
    <P>(b) is of good character;</P>
    <P>(c) has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;</P>
    <P>(d) intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</P>
    <P>(e) has made, either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>
    <P>(2) The conditions specified in paragraphs (1) to (e) of subsection (1) are referred to in this Act as conditions for naturalisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>5.&mdash;The following section is hereby substituted for section 16 of the Act of 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;The Minister may, in his absolute <Col N="295" /> discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation in the following cases, although the conditions for naturalisation (or any of them) are not complied with:</P>
    <P>(a) where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations;</P>
    <P>(b) where the applicant is a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish associations;</P>
    <P>(c) where the applicant is a naturalised Irish citizen acting on behalf of a minor child of the applicant;</P>
    <P>(d) where the applicant is married to a naturalised Irish citizen;</P>
    <P>(e) where the applicant is married to a person who is an Irish citizen (otherwise than by naturalisation);</P>
    <P>(f) where the applicant is or has been resident abroad in the public service;</P>
    <P>(g) where the applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of the 28th day of July, 1951 and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of the 31st day of January, 1967, or is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons of the 28th day of September, 1954.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>1.  To consider applications for naturalisation based on investment in the State received by the Minister for Justice and referred to the Group and to make recommendations to the Minister based on the Group's assessment of the jobcreating or job-maintenance capacity of the investment.</P>
    <P>2.  The Group will examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation/advice from relevant <Col N="296" /> agencies where necessary and, in making their recommendations, will apply the following criteria:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Substantial residence must be purchased and retained in ownership for a period of at least 5 years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the 2 years following naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(b) The level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant.</P>
    <P>(c) Where the investment is in the form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least 7 years at an interest rate not greater that 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary market, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower.  The loan shall be made by the applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.</P>
    <P>The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on.  The loan shall not be secured by the assets of the company in which the investment is to be made.</P>
    <P>(d) As ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period; at the very least 5 years.</P>
    <P>(e) the number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only.</P>
    <P>(f) Audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the Group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with the rules of the scheme for naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(g) The investment will be monitored by Forfás to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the Group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship.</P>
    <P>(h) Police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in country of origin (and, if required, from the Police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments) together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to enquire behind it.</P>
    <P>(i) Annual certification by an established auditing firm of accountants to Forfás that the investment is being maintained for the appropriate period.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Investment Based Naturalisation Scheme</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, John O'Donoghue TD, today announced the formal ending of the Investment Based Naturalisation Scheme whose operation had been suspended since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would now proceed to process outstanding cases that were already on hands when he was appointed.  These cases will be dealt with through the formal assessment process already in place since 1994 &mdash; which includes the involvement of an Interdepartmental Advisory Group operating within set terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to stress that it has always been open to would-be investors to seek in the first instance Business Permission to reside in the State.  Persons who have availed of such permission have always been in a position to apply at a later stage for naturalisation under the relevant provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the long-standing arrangements in place for the granting of Business Permission to individuals to reside in Ireland and subsequent naturalisation applications by them will be reviewed.  This review will be carried out by his Department in consultation with other <Col N="298" /> Government Departments and relevant State Agencies.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of this review the system currently in place in respect of Business Residency Permissions and subsequent naturalisations will continue be operated by his Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> In anticipation of the report, I would like to ask the Minister how comprehensive will it be.  Will each application since the scheme was conceived be dealt with?  Will the background information on filling in application forms, the intervening circumstances before the decision was made to grant naturalisation and passports as well as the relevant documentation relating to each application be made available?  I note the Minister has included a type of codicil in relation to Cabinet confidentiality, advice from the Attorney General, etc.</P>
      <P>As this scheme involved the granting of citizenship and passports and where virtually every regulation was set aside, including the residency obligation, the declaration of fidelity, the regulation on investment and the specific forms to be filled, and where most of the basic provisions applying to any type of scheme which should operate on a proper regulated basis were set aside, does the Minister agree that all the details should be published in full and that nothing should be held back?  From the point of view of the public's entitlement to know, there should be no restraint in relation to each detail applying to this scheme.</P>

      <P>I would like to put it on record yet again that I have nothing to hide in relation to the investment based naturalisation scheme.  A large number of questions have been tabled on this matter in recent months and despite the fact the questions relate to events which long predate my assuming office, I have given as much information as was available to me in responding to questions short of disclosing, for reasons of personal confidentially and commercial sensitivity, specific details relating to the identity of investors and companies involved.  I am fully prepared to continue to answer further question which might arise.  In an unprecedented move, I have published this report.  Deputy Higgins would do well to read this report carefully before tossing allegations around the House.</P>
      <P>The foundations of this scheme were laid in the 1980s following a visit to Hong Kong by none other than Deputy John Bruton, now Leader of Fine Gael.  To quote the file, certain far-reaching undertakings to Hong Kong businessmen were given in respect of special terms of naturalisation. It would appear that Deputy Bruton has suffered from amnesia since then but he was the champion of this scheme, of that there is no doubt &mdash; it is chronicled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Higgins, there has been a considerable amount of focusing on certificates granted by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  I am not for <Col N="299" /> one moment suggesting that Deputy Bruton or any of those Ministers operated other than in the national interest but it is perhaps instructive to note that Deputy Owen, as Minister for Justice, issued no less than 40 certificates of naturalisation. Let us be clear about it.  I have been as upfront as I possibly could be throughout.  It is clear that four applications were granted by the Rainbow Coalition Government following on a decision that only those on hand would be dealt with.  These applications were granted when the rainbow coalition Government was on the way out the door.</P>

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Is the Minister aware that in the case of the 11 passports granted to Saudi Arabian and Pakistani gentlemen by the former Minister, Ray Burke, who personally signed the certificates of naturalisation, which was unprecedented because it is normally done by the Assistant Secretary, and which were personally delivered by the former Taosieach and leader of his party, Charlie Haughey, that the residency requirement was not complied with, the oath of fidelity does not seem to have been compiled with, some of the applications were made on the wrong forms and that numerous technical and legal safeguards were not met?</P>
      <P>In such a situation, is there not an obligation to publish each detail?  I hope every detail will come out in the report which he has now promised.  Is the Minister aware that the arrangements were so loose it would have been easier to get a passport than a medical card and that they were wide open to exploitation?  Somebody could make an arrangement in relation to drawing down £1 million of investment, leave it in a bank, borrow it at 3 per cent, invest it at 11 per cent and draw down £0.5 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the Legal Aid Board I continually monitor the position with regard to waiting times at the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.  I am aware waiting lists in some law centres have increased notwithstanding the allocation of significant additional resources to the board.</P>
      <P>The increase in waiting times at the board's law centres is attributable to a significant degree to the continuing increase in the level of demand on the board's services arising from the introduction in recent years of additional family law legislation, including the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  In the calendar year of 1997, the Legal Aid Board provided legal services to 13,805 people.  The number of legal aid cases requiring representation in court increased from 4,460 to 6,021, an increase of 35 per cent over the previous year. This was the seventh successive year in which there was an increase in the level of service provided by the law centres operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
      <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and when, for whatever reason, they become excessive, appropriate remedial action is taken where possible.  The board has a number of vacancies for solicitor staff and I am advised it will advertise a competition for the recruitment of solicitors for its law centres in the near future. I will continue to monitor the situation closely and I will give the board every assistance in dealing with problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board operates a policy of providing a priority service in a range of issues which include domestic violence, child care and child abduction. A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis.  For example, 180 of the 680 appointments offered in law centres in May 1998 were for priority matters.  None of those accorded priority were put on waiting lists. In the Dublin area, 120 appointments were <Col N="301" /> offered through the private practitioner scheme operated by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will inform the House of my plans to address the waiting lists in law centres.  Some time ago the board submitted substantive staffing proposals to my Department.  These proposals were examined in depth, arising from which my Department made a detailed request for sanction for additional staff to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Last week I met the chairman and chief executive of the board at their request to discuss the delays in the law centres and their proposals to alleviate the problem.  Shortly after that meeting, I raised the matter with the Minister for Finance. I am confident the additional staffing, which will be announced in the very near future, will significantly reduce the waiting lists at law centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A reply to a parliamentary question on 14 May indicated an alarming increase in the waiting times for most of the law centres throughout the country.  For example, in nine centres the waiting time was in excess of ten months, in five the waiting time was one year and in one case, 14½ months.  This is a substantial increase in the waiting times given in January 1997.  The increase over the past 16 months is substantially larger than is acceptable.  I accept that more solicitors will be employed but given the extent of the problem and that access to civil legal aid should be the right of everyone, irrespective of ability to pay, will the Minister specify what remedial action will be taken, particularly in those nine centres where the waiting time is in excess of ten months?  It is unacceptable and means that access to civil law is not practicable for those on the waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an increase in the waiting period at the centres.  This is due to a welcome proliferation of family law in recent years.  In the main the centres deal with family law matters.  Very definitely, something must be done to rectify the situation.  Some time ago the board submitted substantive staffing proposals to my Department.  These were examined in depth, arising from which my Department made a detailed request for sanction for additional staff to the Department of Finance.  Recognising the problem, which the Deputy has outlined, last week at their request I met the chairman and chief executive of the board to discuss the delays in the law centres and their proposals to alleviate the problem.  I am confident the additional staffing, which will be announced in the near future, will significantly reduce the waiting lists at law centres.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 7, 18, 28, 41, 45, and 69 of 14 May 1998, the Garda Commissioner ordered an investigation into the alleged surveillance of two journalists employed by RTE.  On being interviewed by a senior garda officer investigating the matter, neither journalist was able to provide direct evidence of surveillance taking place.</P>
      <P>The Garda investigation of these allegations remains open, but so far, no evidence has come to light which would enable the Garda to submit a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking directions for prosecutions.  The suggestion that a serving member of the Garda Síochána was involved in the surveillance operation, if there was one, is a very serious matter.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as matters stand, the Garda are not aware of the reports suggested. Furthermore, according to the Garda authorities, at no stage during the investigation was there any suggestion that a serving member of an Garda</P>
      <P>Síochána was involved in the alleged unauthorised surveillance of the two journalists in question, nor did evidence of such activity come to light.  However, if anyone has any information on this aspect of the matter, I exhort him to contact the Garda immediately.</P>

What steps have been taken to establish who exactly was carrying out surveillance on the two journalists &mdash; George Lee and Charlie Bird &mdash; who broke a public interest story and did a marvellous service by uncovering one of the biggest banking scandals in history, where customers, big and small, were systematically ripped off by a bank over a long period?</P>

Obviously the question of whether surveillance took place is a matter for the Garda Síochána. The Garda Síochána could not find that evidence. Neither could they find evidence that surrveilance was not taking place.  In the absence of some evidence it is clear the Garda investigation cannot proceed any further at this time.  I emphasise the allegation was and is being treated seriously and if further information comes to light the Garda will certainly investigate it.  In the meantime the file remains open.</P>

      <P>I have asked the Attorney General for advice relating to the committal warrant in question.  In the circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment further on this case.</P>
      <P>The rules applying to juvenile offenders are complex and I hope Deputies bear with me while I explain them.  It would not be possible to provide the Deputy with an adequate answer to her question without explaining the committal options available.</P>
      <P>Male offenders aged 16 and 17 and up to the age of 21 may be committed on remand to or to serve a period of detention in St. Patrick's Institution. Male offenders aged 17 and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment to the four adult committal prisons, Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick and Portlaoise.  Sentenced male offenders aged 16 and 17 may be transferred from any of the four adult committal prisons and from St. Patrick's Institution to Wheatfield Place of Detention, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle to serve their sentences.</P>
      <P>Wheatfield and Fort Mitchel provide a more suitable environment for young offenders sentenced to imprisonment or detention.  The age structure of the population at Wheatfield and Fort Mitchel is relatively young and the regimes place greater emphasis on education and work training for young offenders than the regimes in the adult prisons.  Shanganagh Castle is an open centre reserved exclusively for male offenders aged between 16 and 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Female offenders aged 17 and over may be committed on remand or sentenced to imprisonment <Col N="304" /> to Mountjoy and Limerick Women's Prisons. However, very few female offenders aged 17 are committed to penal institutions each year. At present there are no female offenders aged 17 in custody in Mountjoy or Limerick Prisons.</P>
    <P>Offenders under the age of 15 cannot be committed to a prison under any circumstances. Fifteen year old male offenders and 15 and 16 year old female offenders can be committed to prison only in exceptional circumstances.  This can occur only in cases where the court certifies under the provisions of sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908, that the young person is so unruly or depraved of character that he or she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under Part V of the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional Information.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The legal provisions for the committal of young offenders under the age of 18 will change on enactment of the Children Bill, 1996.  The Bill proposes that, where a court imposes a period of detention on a child, it shall order the child to be detained in a children's detention school operated by the Department of Education and Science where the child is under 16 years of age, or to be detained in a place of detention provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform where the child is 16 or 17 years of age.</P>
    <P>When a child who was under 16 when they were committed on indictment reaches 18, the chief executive of the children detention schools can apply to the court to have the child transferred to a place of detention provided by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Such application has to set out the reasons for it and to justify it.  Otherwise the court may refuse to make the order resulting in the child remaining in the children detention school until he or she reached 18.  At that stage, if the sentence was not fully served, as in a murder case, the child would then transfer to a place of detention operated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  A child convicted of murder will be liable to the same penalty as an adult, that is, life imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I understand a girl under 17 cannot be sent to prison but can be sent to a place of detention.  However, there is no such place in the State for girls between 16 and 17.  Oberstown House is a remand and assessment centre and no detention is possible there for more than three weeks.  In effect, there is nowhere to put a girl between 16 and 17 who has been sentenced to detention.  This is a serious situation.  What does the State do when a girl between 16 and 17 has been sentenced to detention?</P>

      <P>Oberstown House is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and the issue of the committal warrant in this case gives rise to complicated legal matters which I have raised with the Attorney General.  I do not wish to go into detail on that. However, I assure the Deputy that I am taking <Col N="305" /> the Attorney General's advice on the issue but it would be inappropriate to comment further.</P>
      <P>Sixteen year old females can only be committed to a prison in the exceptional circumstances of a court certifying that she is so unruly or depraved of character that she cannot be detained in a place of detention provided under the Act.  In the case of a person convicted of murder, the certificate would not apply in that instance because the offence would be regarded as being very grave and this would also apply to the offence of manslaughter.  The issue of committal in circumstances where complications arise would be referred by any responsible Minster to the Attorney General and his advice is awaited in the case which the Deputy perhaps has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not of concern to the Minister that, if a girl has committed an offence serious enough for her to be sentenced to detention, there is no proper provision for her?  Surely a girl of that age who would commit such an offence would need to be detained where she could have proper rehabilitation to ensure she would not reoffend.  We are all agreed that, if young people offend at that age, it is absolutely essential there is proper intervention to ensure they do not set out on a criminal path.  Does the Minister intend to take further action in this regard?</P>

      <P>Where a young female offender has been committed, I assure the Deputy that special arrangements are made.  This would include allocation to a suitable single cell and the designation of a female prison officer to remain with her during all times she is out of the cell to protect her, if that should prove to be necessary.  The new women's prison, which will be operational towards the end of the year, will provide a higher standard of accommodation, greater access to recreational and other facilities and more scope for the proper segregation of young offenders. Special account is taken of the fact that they are young offenders.</P>

      <P>I have obtained the approval of the Government for the drafting of legislation <Col N="306" /> which will radically reform the law on fraud and dishonesty.  The Criminal Justice (Fraud Offences) Bill will: create a new offence of theft to replace the existing common law offence of larceny, numerous statutory offences of larceny and the statutory offences of embezzlement, fraudulent conversion and obtaining by false pretences; create new offences to deal with dishonest behaviour not properly covered by existing legislation; create new offences of forgery to replace the existing law of 1913; create new offences of counterfeiting to replace the existing law of 1861; provide a new power for the Garda Síochána to obtain search warrants for documentary evidence of offences of fraud and dishonesty; contain provisions to enable Ireland to adopt the important EU Convention on the Protection of the European Communities' Financial Interests and three protocols to that convention; and bring together in one consolidated statute the main offences of fraud and dishonesty.</P>
      <P>As regards corruption, I have included in my legislative programme a Prevention of Corruption Bill primarily to make any legislative changes necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign</P>
      <P>Public Officials in International Business Transactions which was signed by Ireland on 17 December 1997.  The opportunity may also be taken in that Bill to provide for the ratification of the EU convention on corruption involving officials of the EU or member states of the EU. This latter convention is due to be ratified by member states before the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>I am currently carrying out an examination of the existing laws on corruption &mdash; which are very widely cast &mdash; to determine what changes, if any, are required to enable Ireland to become a party to the OECD convention.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The laws in the area of corruption are grossly inadequate.  The area is governed by three statutes dated 1889, 1906 and 1916.  The law is totally out of date.  As far as common law is concerned, there is a gross deficiency in the definition of bribery and that law has evolved in a most unsatisfactory manner with the result that it is almost impossible to define.  The Minister needs to introduce a specific statute law dealing with bribery which will define the offence which is currently open to many definitions.  There is no law on &ldquo;payola&rdquo; or secret commissions, about which we have heard so much in recent times.  Unless this matter is made open and transparent and the law is tightened <Col N="307" /> up, public confidence in many of our deliberations on these issues will not be restored.</P>

      <P>The law on corruption is set out in three Acts &mdash; the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act, 1889 and the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1906 and 1916.  The dates of these Acts indicate there is a need for a radical overhaul of the law on dishonesty and that is what I propose in the new fraud legislation.  I want to provide that it will be a serious criminal offence to dishonestly make a gain or cause a loss.  That broad sweep will radically alter the current law and provide us with a solid statutory base for the criminal law on dishonesty.</P>
      <P>The offences of corruption referred to in the three Acts are widely cast and cover corruption in the public and private sectors.  The provisions of the statutes as they relate to penalties and holders of public office, such as Ministers, were significantly reformed and updated by the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.  Deputy Flanagan will be aware this is an extremely complex area but it is being tackled head on by the Government.  I hope to introduce the most comprehensive law on fraud in the not too distant future.</P>

      <Quest>the investigations, if any, that take place when asylum seekers make applications for refugee status to ensure the applications are genuine; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important feature of the asylum determination process for an asylum seeker to show that he or she has grounds for being recognised as a refugee and that the asylum seeker is who he or she claims to be.  It is necessary, therefore, for all asylum seekers to produce, as far as it is possible in their circumstances, some sort of evidence as to their identity.  Accordingly, it is common practice to advise all asylum seekers to try to secure and provide documentary evidence of their nationality and documentary evidence to support their application for asylum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department attend meetings of Council of Europe committees where asylum and migration issues are discussed.  The Department has access to all Council of Europe documentation in these areas and other areas, e,g, human rights, as appropriate.  Information from many different areas, governmental and non-governmental, and in particular from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is used to assist in assessing the validity of cases put forward by applicants for refugee status.  International experience is that some people intentionally <Col N="308" /> misuse asylum procedures for illegal immigration purposes.</P>
    <P>Attempts by people with no valid claim to international protection take advantage of asylum procedures and create serious problems by clogging those procedures.  Such abusive claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal migrants and, in turn, reflects negatively on the asylum institution and, hence, on bona fide refugees.</P>
    <P>An applicant for refugee status must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear exists in the context of the refugee definition in the UN Convention of 1951 and the 1967 Protocol, the applicant will be granted refugee status.  Each application is individually examined and it is only after such examination is completed that a decision on its well-foundedness can be taken.</P>
    <P>All applications are examined in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention to determine if Ireland is the appropriate state to consider the applications.  Following this examination, the applications are considered in accordance with the definition of a refugee as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This section defines a refugee as someone who, owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
    <P>While recognising that there is a problem with abuse of asylum procedures as a means of facilitating illegal immigration, it is nevertheless critically important that cases are not prejudged, that each application is fully and fairly considered and that each applicant has access to an independent appeals system.  These are the principles by which I am operating and will continue to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly acknowledge Ireland's obligations to genuine refugees.  I have asked questions on this subject in the past which drew unfair criticism.  However, I will not be deterred in my efforts to ensure that genuine refugees are accommodated but that taxpayers money is not misspent on rogue refugees or illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>I have a report from the biggest health board which handles more than 90 per cent of the illegal immigrants and asylum seekers claiming refugee status.  The report states: &mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The health board states that dealing <Col N="309" /> with the vast and rapid increase in the number of asylum seekers has presented many difficulties to the board's officers, not least being that of establishing and verifying identity and that in many cases asylum seekers have no documentation whatsoever and it is national policy not to make inquiries in the country of origin.</P>
      <P>This applies in all health board areas.  The Minister commented on the production of evidence of identity.  I understand there is a certain amount of racketeering involved and that it is suggested to those claiming refugee status that they should not have evidence of identity. It would be a difficult task but what steps or measures are open to the Minister to try and ensure that evidence will be produced?</P>

      <P>I am fully aware that many asylum seekers are forced to flee their countries of origin without any documentation as to their identity.  It is an important feature of the asylum determination process for an asylum seeker to show that he or she has grounds for being recognised as a refugee and that they are who they claim to be.  It is necessary for all asylum seekers to produce, as far as possible, some evidence of identity.</P>
      <P>It should be recognised that not all asylum seekers flee their alleged countries of origin without some form of identifying documentation.  Many asylum seekers are in a position to produce identification papers.  It is common practice to advise all asylum seekers to try and secure documentary evidence of their nationality to support their application for asylum.  It is not, nor never has been the practice to prevent any applicant completing the questionnaire simply because he or she cannot provide such evidence.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Callely's concern for genuine refugees.  I assure him the procedures in place in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which are open, transparent and fair, are being dealt with by people of the highest integrity, are appealable to appeals authorities and amenable to judicial review.  A case can be taken to the highest court in the land, if that is the applicant's choice.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is important when debating this issue to use accurate terms and that Deputy Callely displayed ignorance by using terms like &ldquo;genuine refugees&rdquo; and &ldquo;rogue refugees&rdquo;?  We all should know that one is either a refugee or not.  Does the Minister agree it is important to use proper and accurate language and not, intentionally or unintentionally, to raise the temperature, given that it is often ignorance that leads to fear which, in turn, leads to racism?</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Callely's intention was to distinguish between an illegal immigrant and a refugee.  All applicants are in the first instance asylum seekers.  When the determination process has been completed, an individual <Col N="310" /> is deemed to be a refugee or an illegal immigrant. To be fair to Deputy Callely &mdash; I am sure he can speak for himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that I was trying to determine the difference between an illegal immigrant and a genuine refugee. Those claiming refugee status are dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, while programme refugees are dealt with by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am sure I do not have to lecture people on the different terminology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps when other speakers use the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; they should explain that there are programme refugees and asylum seekers seeking refugee status.  I am pleased that fair procedures are in place in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform because there was a three or four year gestation period when they were not in place.  We have clarified the point about genuine asylum seekers fleeing persecution who deserve refugee status, but does the Minister know the number of illegal immigrants who are engaged in a racketeer industry and bringing people into the country who do not have a right to be here?  Can procedures be put in place to ensure these people, when caught, are not accommodated overnight, but returned to the country of origin without delay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is evidence of organised trafficking in people to this country.  That is why I recently announced a new Bill to deal with the matter.  I do not have the statistics the Deputy seeks, but I can give him some idea of the number awaiting decisions and in doing so I am not casting aspersions on any of these people.  As of 31 May 1998 there were 5,678 applications awaiting decisions.  I cannot categorise them because they must go through the determination process before it is decided whether they are refugees or illegal immigrants.  Of those, six claims were lodged in 1995, 489 were lodged in 1996, 3,053 were lodged in 1997 and between 1 January and 31 May 1998, 2,130 were lodged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a parliamentary question on the number of deportations as a result of the new procedures.  I was informed that no deportations had been carried out under those procedures, even though we all know deportations are being carried out.  How many deportations have been carried out under the new 10 December procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a statistical question and not allowable.  Nonetheless, if I had the exact <Col N="311" /> figure I would inform the Deputy.  There have been some deportations, but the figure is not high.  I will, however, communicate the precise figure to Deputy McManus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other side of the coin, will the Minister indicate the number of repatriations that have occurred in respect of refugees in his Department compared with programme refugees in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  Question No. 100 refers to statistics with regard to percentage increases.  I would welcome that information from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have notice of these questions, but I will give the Deputies whatever statistics I have.  I can now tell Deputy McManus that to date in 1998, 22 persons have been served with deportation orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that under the new procedures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I anticipate that is under the new procedures, but the procedures that were in place prior to coming into force of the new procedures were also administrative in the sense that the Refugee Act, 1996, has not been fully implemented for reasons outlined on numerous occasions.  There have been 21 deportations to date this year.  In one case a deportation order was served but not effected because of a judicial review and the person concerned remains illegally in the State.  The statistics which Deputy Callely seeks are not readily available to me, but I will make them available to him at the earliest possible opportunity and I will clarify any point arising for Deputy McManus.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated previously in the House, I am examining, in consultation with my Government colleagues, the report of the Consultative Group on the Private Security Industry.  The consultative group considered a broad range of issues across the private security industry and the report recognised that there are complex problems to be addressed in any proposals to regulate the industry.</P>
      <P>It recommended that no single solution will prevent, alleviate or solve the problems and proposed that the best way forward is through a combination of measures which have significant implications for a broad range of Government Departments, as well as for the Garda Síochána. In addition, the group made a number of recommendations which raised issues of a legal nature.</P>
      <P>The process of consultation with my Government colleagues, and my examination of their views, is almost complete.  When I have completed my examination in the near future, it is my intention to bring proposals to Government which will recommend an appropriate course of action.</P>

      <P>The consultative group and the group appointed by the previous Minister reported last December.  We are midway through the year and we are still at the consultation stage. In the past we have seen urgent legislation being speedily introduced.  Has the Minister recently <Col N="313" /> met the Irish Security Federation?  Is the federation in favour of dealing with door supervisors or bouncers in the context of legislation?  Has the Minister decided on the heads of a Bill and, if so, has he decided to bring them to Cabinet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a delay in addressing this issue.  However, there are significant implications for a range of Government agencies arising from the report.  Also, there are complex legal issues which have not been previously addressed.  We have consulted a number of other Departments and have received the views, conclusions and recommendations of the report.  My intention, following completion of a detailed consideration of the report, is to bring proposals to Government, I hope, in the very near future.  I agreed to a request for a meeting from the private security industry.  We discussed the matter in detail and I explained the position. I also explained why I was not in a position to accept the Deputy's Private Members' Bill: there is no need to go over those reasons again.</P>
      <P>I favour regulation of the security industry and it is my intention in the near future to bring proposals to Government and ensure legislation is drafted once the Government agrees certain proposals. I will then not be found wanting in pushing ahead with the publication of legislation.</P>

Has the Minister received approval from the Government and the Departments &mdash; I would appreciate information on the Departments concerned &mdash; for the introduction of legislation which will incorporate different aspects of their views?  From previous experience we know that when more than one Department is involved, officials may say a particular route cannot be pursued.  Do the relevant Ministers agree the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may introduce and implement legislation with the backing of the other Departments?</P>

      <P>No disquiet was expressed to me by the representatives of the security industry whom I met concerning Deputy Farrelly's Bill.  I explained why I wanted to introduce a comprehensive security Bill.  The Departments with responsibility in these areas are in favour of the proposals in the report of the consultative group in the context of bringing certain elements of the industry out of the black economy.</P>
      <P>There are significant issues relating to health and safety in the industry which must be tackled with a view to improving the conditions of employment in it.  I assure the Deputy that there has been extensive consultation and the views expressed have been deeply considered.  It is my intention to proceed, in the not too distant future, to bring proposals to Government in order that the issue may be further progressed.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend establishing through the legislation a separate inspectorate to deal with applications for licences? Every day we wait for the legislation to be brought forward there is huge pressure being put on young people by a small number working in the industry in the context of peddling drugs, something which is known throughout the country. Will the Minister give a commitment that the legislation will come before the House in autumn to avoid and reduce the pressure on young people?  This pressure is being brought to bear in night clubs in many parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a growing industry and it operates in a very sensitive area.  Regarding an inspectorate, the scope for self regulation, which is effectively what currently exists, is somewhat limited.  I am also conscious that should the Government agree to legislation &mdash; I hope it will and anticipate this happening &mdash; it will take time for the provisions to take effect.  I will continue to explore the potential for progress on a cross departmental basis.  However, it would not be possible to give a precise deadline to the Deputy regarding when the legislation will be ready.  It would be wrong for me to do so as it would tie me to a date and it may not be possible to adhere to it due to the raft of legislation being processed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Resources can only stretch so far, and the Deputy will appreciate the Department carries a very significant legislative programme. However, I will continue to do everything possible to expedite the matter.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Does the Minister acknowledge that, of all industries, the security industry is wide open to exploitation?  People are involved in the protection and so-called securing of large volumes of money.  Yet, there is no regulation, supervision, standards or character references. The entire industry is wide open in the context of allowing criminal elements enter it and organise a major heist.  I ask the Minister to try to prioritise the legislation, particularly in view of the number of decommissioned paramilitaries. This matter should be a priority for the next term.</P>

      <P>Self regulation exists which I said is limited in scope.  In the past there have allegations that criminal elements have infiltrated the security industry to assist in organising and orchestrating robberies.  It is for this reason that there is a real need to regulate the industry as quickly as possible.  Developments are also ongoing at European level with regard to the publication of standards for the various aspects of the industry.  It is very important that we do not <Col N="315" /> lose sight of the fact that many reputable companies operate within the industry and provide a valuable and professional service.

    <P>As can be seen from the figures, two institutions were operating above their bed capacity and a further four institutions operating above their design capacity on 19 June last.  The biggest problem with overcrowding continues to be in our committal prisons and, in particular, in Mountjoy and St Patrick's Institution.  To address this problem I have put in place a substantial programme of prison refurbishment and reconstruction and the Government is on schedule to deliver on the commitment to provide 1,000 additional prisoner places in the first two years of its term of office.</P>
    <P>I recently officially opened the new prison at Castlerea which has accommodation for some 188 prisoners in total.  The new women's prison at Mountjoy and the remand prison at Cloverhill beside Wheatfield Place of Detention will be on stream around the end of the year with the new 400 man prison in Portlaoise following in autumn 1999.  I am actively considering the issue of further prison places beyond this. <Col N="317" /> The extensive refurbishment programme at the older prisons is also continuing.  Planning for the replacement of the C wing at Limerick prison has commenced and it is hoped that construction will start at the end of the year.  It is also planned to replace the D Block in Portlaoise prison.  The refurbishment of Mountjoy prison, over a five year period, including the installation of integral sanitation, is planned to start as soon as possible following the opening of a new remand centre at Cloverhill.  While the refurbishment of Mountjoy is long overdue, it would simply not be possible to start it in advance of additional prison accommodation being available.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing additional prison spaces I am fully committed, in the interest of providing a balanced treatment of offenders regime, to the development of community sanctions and measures as alternatives to custody and as a means of combating crime.  My Department's probation and welfare service has a significant role to play in this regard.  A number of alternatives to custody are already in place, for example more than 1,000 offenders are placed on probation orders each year.  Another alternative to custody which has proven successful is community service with approximately 1,600 offenders being required by the courts to perform community service each year.  A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision.  This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision.  Participants may be referred to this scheme by courts as an alternative to a substantial sentence of two years or more. Furthermore, offenders in custody for similar sentences may be released early from custody towards the end their sentence under intensive supervision.  It is my Department's policy to develop probation as a viable alternative to imprisonment.  To this end, funding is provided to more than 40 hostels, day centres and workshops.</P>
    <P>I again stress my commitment to community sanctions and measures as viable alternatives to custody.  I recently established a group to examine the probation and welfare service, its role, needs and organisational structure, and to make recommendations on how the service should develop into the next millennium.  I also secured funding for a much needed new IT system for the service which will be developed in 1998 and for three new probation centres.  In total, I have increased funding for the probation and welfare service by 27 per cent in 1998 over the 1997 allocation.  The measures I have outlined will, in time, alleviate the problem of overcrowding in our prison system.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> Will the Minister identify the two prisons in which the overcrowding problem exists and outline their official capacity and the prisoner complement in each case as of last Friday?  Is the Minister aware that the most damning denunciation of the prison system was <Col N="318" /> contained in the chaplains' report published on 5 June which set down in detail a list of 79 recommendations for major improvements, not simply in regard to funding but also in regard to attitude, organisation and administration?  Heavy emphasis was placed on the fact that vulnerable prisoners were being pressurised into sexual activity, the existence of inhumane conditions, barbaric treatment and, as the Minister acknowledged in the case of two prisons at least, chronic overcrowding. What is the Minister doing to address the issues raised in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the men's and women's prisons at Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution.  The design capacity of the male prison at Mountjoy is 547, the bed capacity is 670 and the number in custody on 19 June 1998 &mdash; the latest figure available to me &mdash; was 738.  In the female prison, the design capacity is 60, the bed capacity is 60 and the number in custody on 19 June 1998 was 59.  In St. Patrick's Institution, the design capacity is 165, the bed capacity is 172 and the number in custody on 19 June 1998 was 180.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the overcrowding in Irish prisons and I fully accept that a serious problem exists in this regard.  That is why we have embarked upon the biggest building and refurbishment prison programme in the history of the State.  It would be remiss of me not to mention in passing that the cancellation &mdash; or postponement &mdash; of Castlerea prison by the former Minister for Justice has contributed to the current problem as it delayed the prison building programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Since coming into office, this Government has put this matter to the forefront and is currently engaged in tangible work to alleviate what I regard as a very serious problem. I received the chaplains' report, to which Deputy Higgins referred, on 19 May this year.  In preparing their report, the chaplains understandably placed an overriding emphasis on the spiritual and personal welfare of prisoners.  Their unique positions within the prison system give them a valuable oversight of conditions in our penal institutions and, in those circumstances, their views must be taken seriously.  As Deputy Higgins pointed out, there are 79 recommendations in the report, but an initial examination of it would suggest that few of the issues raised are new.  Some relate to important policy issues which will require detailed consideration, but the more general issues include rehabilitation, overcrowding, poor conditions, drug abuse, medical, psychiatric and psychological services, etc.  I have commented on previous occasions on many of the other issues raised, including the drug problem in our prisons and efforts to deal with it by reducing the demand for and supply of drugs, and I accept much work needs to be done in this area.  I am <Col N="319" /> keen to extend the number of places available for treatment of sex offenders.  There are many recommendations in the report, to which I cannot devote any meaningful time in the short time available, but Deputies can be assured it is being considered in great detail and being given the weight it deserves.</P>

      <P>My recollection is that the previous Government approved the building of Castlerea prison, we opened it and the Minister opened an extension to it.

I will have an opportunity to deal with those matters on another day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the dividend of the peace process in the North and that probably 400 prisoners will be released over the next two years, will the Minister consider renting some prison spaces from the prison authorities there, as there are a number of prison officers in the North who are worried about their jobs?  Those spaces would be useful for detaining hardened prisoners, especially those involved in drug pushing and so on.  Will the Minister have a discussion on that to seek to alleviate the serious problem of the lack of capacity in our prisons which is likely to be a problem for some time to come, regardless of the number of prison spaces he opens?</P>

      <P>We are providing a new prison at Portlaoise which will have 400 spaces.  It will be a stand alone prison on a site adjacent to Portlaoise prison and will be known as Midlands prison.  We are also building a new remand prison at Clover Hill.  It will be the main prison in the State when it is completed in the autumn.  We are well on course towards providing an additional 1,000 prison places as promised and I anticipate the number provided will be 1,092.  Everything I said in relation to the Members of the House is correct.  Deputy Farrelly is welcome to take up those matters with me at any time here or elsewhere.</P>

The number of prison places that will be built in the first two years will adequately address the immediate problem.  I am conscious there is an insufficient number of prison places and that is why we have embarked on the most adventurous programme of prison building and refurbishment in the history of the State and why the Government committed itself to the provision of a further 1,000 spaces following the building of the first phase.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 17 together.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to increase Garda numbers to bring the strength of the force to 12,000.  That will require the recruitment of an estimated 2,200 gardaí.  I propose to achieve that <Col N="321" /> over a period of five years.  The intake of additional recruits to meet this target commenced in January and the intention is to recruit a total of 550 trainees during 1998.</P>
      <P>The written tests for the 1997 Garda recruitment competition took place in September last and interviewing of candidates who were successful in those written tests is ongoing.  The need for a further recruitment competition or competitions to meet the commitment in the programme for Government will be kept under review in my Department and my proposals will be a matter for consideration by the Government in due course.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his intention to recruit more gardaí.  Does he recognise that the gardaí deployed in Border counties following the BSE crisis are doing excellent work under increased pressure?  While the number of gardaí deployed there during that crisis may not have been greater than the number deployed in other counties, they worked a good deal of overtime and more resources were used. Will the Minister take special cognisance of the Border region when deploying additional gardaí given the extra pressures under which they work due to their close proximity of large urban areas in the Six Counties?  I hope the Minister will reach his recruitment target within the next few years.</P>

      <P>The number of gardaí recruited is a policy matter for the Government of the day.  During the period of the previous Administration natural wastage outstripped recruitment.  While the Garda Síochána Ranks Order 1982 provided for a maximum strength of 12,000 gardaí, that has never been achieved.  The highest ever strength of the force was 11,396.  It is intended to increase the number of gardaí to 12,000.  That would be the maximum strength pursuant to the 1982 order.  It is indicative of the Government's commitment to law and order.  I assure Deputy Keaveney that her request will be communicated to the Garda Commissioner.</P>

He allocates gardaí according to where the need is greatest <Col N="322" /> and I have no doubt that he will continue to pursue this policy.

      <P>The greater visibility of the gardaí in urban areas, particularly in Dublin, as a result of the policies pursued by this Minister and his predecessor has worked well.  Crime in Dublin has been reduced.  With due respect to the concerns of my rural colleagues, that policy should be maintained and the number of gardaí in Dublin increased when the new recruits come on stream.</P>

Is the Minister aware that in certain rural areas, for example, Duleek in County Meath with which the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will be familiar, the number of crimes being reported is one in three and that the lack of gardaí in the area has led to a huge increase in the number of crimes?

      <P>The same system of reporting has been in existence for some time. Indeed, with the introduction of crime stoppers in Dublin the facility for reporting crime or giving information in relation to crime has improved.  It is always difficult to say how much crime is being reported.  When comparing one year with another, one can only say that the system in place was the same so, all else being equal, if the figures go up or down they indicate an increase or decrease.  It is true that some crimes are unreported but it would be churlish of the Deputy not to accept that there has been a significant improvement.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is necessary legislation to continue the fight against the evil of drug barons and those who peddle drugs.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the House an excellent survey on drug abuse in third level colleges which was carried out by the Union of Students in Ireland.  It is the first such survey and the research was carried out in October and November, 1997 and January and February 1998.  I congratulate USI on conducting the survey as part of its drug awareness campaign.  When we discuss drug abuse we tend to concentrate on the deprived areas of our cities where drug abuse is a significant problem.  However, we usually ignore other areas even though drug abuse occurs at all levels of society.  It is important that we are conscious of the need to tackle the drugs problem in a multifaceted way.</P>
      <P>A total of 72 per cent of respondents indicated that they took drugs for the first time at second level; 5 per cent, at primary level; and 23 per cent, at college.  The earliest age at which a respondent took drugs for the first time was 11.  The majority took drugs for the first time between the ages of 14 and 18.  A small number took drugs for the first time over the age of 18.  I was surprised to learn that only 10 per cent indicated that the drug they had tried first was ecstasy compared to a figure of 47 per cent for cannabis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a view that young people experiment <Col N="325" /> with drugs because of peer pressure but 75 per cent of respondents indicated that they took drugs initially out of curiosity.  Only 17 per cent indicated that they took drugs because their peer group was doing so.  This appears to suggest that an awareness campaign to create a better understanding of drug abuse could be effective.  A total of 67 per cent indicated that they had received information prior to taking drugs.  When asked from where they had received it, 28 per cent indicated that they had obtained it from articles, 24 per cent from friends, 23 per cent at school, 10 per cent from parents and 8 per cent from an older sibling while 6 per cent said they had found it out for themselves.  A strong awareness campaign highlighting the dangers associated with experimenting with drugs should influence young people not to get involved.</P>
    <P>A total of 69 per cent of respondents indicated that they were aware of the effects drugs could have.  A total of 62 per cent indicated that they now consume a larger quantity.  Those who use drugs on a weekly basis usually smoke four joints a week on average.  Most would describe themselves as regular cannabis users.  The average amount spent per week on hash is £10 to £15. Others would describe themselves as weekend users.  Their average alcohol intake is six pints on a night out.  They take one ecstasy tablet on average. Those who use drugs on a few occasions each month spend £10 on average on hash.  The other drugs used in this manner are ecstasy, speed and poppers.</P>
    <P>Those respondents who cited affordability as the reason for continuing to use drugs indicated that smoking cannabis was cheaper than alcohol with better effects.  A small minority indicated that they were probably addicted to it.  Other reasons given included the relief of pain and psychological dependence.</P>
    <P>When asked from where they obtained drugs 27 per cent of respondents indicated that their source of supply was a regular dealer; 53 per cent said friends; 7 per cent, college; and 4 per cent, on the street.  When asked about the immediate dangers associated with the drug of their choice, the five main dangers cited were addiction, death, the tendency to use heavier drugs, health problems and loss of control and consciousness.  Other factors included the cost of drugs, the fear of prosecution by the Garda Síochána, the fear of being caught by their parents, and the fear that they would be taken advantage of or injured while under the influence.</P>
    <P>A total of 57 per cent of respondents indicated that they had a bad experience.  Those who had a bad experience with LSD had suffered from hallucinations lasting up to two hours.  One respondent indicated that an LSD trip had lasted up to 12 hours with flashbacks which had lasted between three to seven hours.  Those who had a bad experience with ecstasy had suffered from hyperactivity with jaw and tongue spasms and a negative come down, including extreme paranoia, <Col N="326" /> palpitations, sweats and terror of friends.  Loss of appetite, a feeling of weakness and breathing difficulties often lasted into the following day.  One respondent indicated that his breathing had stopped and that his rib cage and upper abdomen muscles had arrested.  He believed his experience was due to a bad tablet.  He subsequently gave it up.  A bad acid trip can last eight to nine hours. One respondent indicated that he had a ten to 15 minute flashback while on a bus.  Those who had a bad experience while taking magic mushrooms had suffered from paranoia lasting several weeks. Other respondents indicated that they had physically injured themselves when mixing magic mushrooms and acid.  Others suffered from constant vomiting when mixing alcohol and ecstasy, loss of sensation in limbs for 30 to 40 minutes when mixing alcohol and cannabis and a feeling of weakness and panic attacks for 15 to 20 minutes when mixing alcohol, cannabis and poppers.</P>
    <P>A total of 61 per cent of respondents indicated that the policies of dance clubs were not safe; 86 per cent indicated that ecstasy was part of the club scene; 83 per cent indicated that a public campaign would not stop them taking drugs; while 41 per cent indicated that they considered media reporting to be sensational, 40 per cent, informative, and 19 per cent, too emotional.</P>
    <P>I refer to these figures because, when dealing with this problem, people tend to associate it with a certain socio-economic group or parts of cities. Undoubtedly, drugs such as heroin, which accounts for only 1 per cent of use in colleges, is endemic in parts of the capital city.  It is appropriate that the public is concerned about the drug problem which is a blight on communities.  It is not only a city issue.  It affects rural areas also. Drugs are available in most rural towns and villages. One can report it to the Garda but people are reluctant to name the individuals involved.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the need to introduce the legislation to deal with drug trafficking and dealers.  It is most important that the drug barons and those making enormous sums of money from drug trafficking are caught and the force of law applied to them.  We must ensure the laws do not contain loopholes.  I am glad the Bill highlights the vital distinction between the position of addicts who are accused of being in possession of drugs and people who deal drugs for the sole purpose of profit at the expense of misfortunate addicts.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that, regardless of the seriousness of the problem in communities, the fundamental rules of law and democracy must be applied at all times.  Everything must be done in accordance with constitutional provisions.  The Bill is extensive and a number of sections could be questioned in terms of their severity and the democratic freedom of individuals.  The Minister must take particular note of this aspect.  Reactionary Bills were introduced in the past following unusual cases.  Subsequently, legislation that was introduced in a hurry was successfully challenged on constitutional grounds and it was necessary for <Col N="327" /> the Houses of the Oireachtas to change the statute. The Bill reduces the ministerial power which currently exists and I hope the Minister will explain why this action is being taken in relation to the offence.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.  The measure is long overdue and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it.  In my research I found that some of my original notes on this subject dated back to early 1996.  It is gratifying to note that the House is at last coming to grips with the wave of drug related lawlessness which is raging on the streets of the capital city and provincial towns and cities.</P>
      <P>It is fine for Opposition Deputies to jeer and sneer at the Minister who has positively and firmly come down on the side of law and order. However, unlike his predecessor, he has initiated measures to combat the dreadful conditions thrust upon certain sections of society who live in areas where crime is prevalent.  I can only give a certain amount of latitude to criminals who claim, or on whose behalf it is claimed, that the environment in which they were raised or the poverty to which they were subjected is responsible for their behaviour.  To totally accept this as an excuse for criminality would be to denigrate the efforts made by the vast majority of others in similar economic or social circumstances to lift and keep themselves above the criminal threshold.</P>
      <P>As I prepared my contribution I was interrupted by a telephone call from a constituent.  He wanted to know what we are doing about youth misbehaviour and criminality.  He had been subjected to several hours of abuse by a group of boys and girls aged not more than 11 or 12 years outside his house who made his life a misery. Having failed to reason with them and not wishing to concede to his desire to give them a good hiding, he called the Garda.  It was a disappointing exercise all round.  The Garda were powerless to make any spirited response, the constituent received little satisfaction after his couple of hours of misery and abuse and the children went almost unchecked.</P>
      <P>For those who are willing to listen, the answer to this is what is known as &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; where the lesson is learned at any early age that all misdemeanours will be taken into account and punished in line with what is reasonable.  This lesson will be taken into adolescence and adulthood and may catch a young person in time and prevent him or her drifting into a serious criminal career later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the theft is petty.  Much of the upset, imposition and feeling of violation is caused by small time criminals or out of control teenagers and not by hardened criminals.  This aspect must be addressed as much as major crime.  Whatever legislative steps are necessary must be taken to control it.  However, if the only response to such <Col N="328" /> logic is jeers and dismissal, it will be necessary to introduce more legislation, similar to this Bill, to deal with a situation involving adults which might have been prevented.</P>
    <P>Correction must start at an early age and a culture of correction needs to be reintroduced and developed.  It has been allowed to slip and the people are paying a heavy price for the ineptitude of the previous Administration.  Unfortunately, a situation has not only developed but been positively encouraged where it is almost impossible to deliver correction to a child.  The religious leaders, gardaí and teachers have all encountered this difficulty.  The whispering campaign about it being wrong to slap a child has added little that is positive.</P>
    <P>We must face reality.  Society must be clawed back from those on the criminal side who have hijacked it and those who are prepared to allow the situation to deteriorate further.  It is easy for people to criticise and jeer when decisive policies are put forward and decisive action is proposed but then to panic and blame those around them when the deteriorating situation finally catches up with us.</P>
    <P>Following the Veronica Guerin murder, the former Minister finally sat up and took notice of the slide.  It took that cowardly act to provoke not only the Minister but also society into taking some of the measures for which this side had called for a considerable time.  It is possible to tackle crime and win.  We need only consider the success of the Garda, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other State agencies in the two years since Veronica Guerin's murder.  With a combination of good legislation, adequate resources and a clear unequivocal political message, society can win.  No one is, or can be allowed to be, invincible or untouchable in the State.  Even if that was the only benefit of the last two years of dedicated policing, individual heroism and good Civil Service practice, all the effort would have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>There is no point, however, in tackling only one area of the entire criminal process if no progress is made in other areas to streamline procedures, improve detection and provide additional places of detention.  A more integrated approach is necessary and the Bill is only one piece of a large jigsaw.  Week by week the Minister is putting in place more pieces of the jigsaw.  When all his proposed measures are in place, Ireland will be seen as a criminal unfriendly zone; to use the favoured American expression, &ldquo;they can run but they cannot hide&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Only so much parliamentary time is available to Ministers.  Limited resources are available to each Department and on this occasion the Minister has chosen to meet head on the growing threat to society from drug trafficking.  As I stated previously, the increase in the use of illegal drugs is causing a concurrent rise in ordinary crime. Theft, larceny and burglary provide money for drugs.  It is estimated by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce that the cost of crime to the city's <Col N="329" /> retail sector is approximately £30 million a year. In addition, these businesses spend more than £20 million on preventative measures, a cost the hardpressed retail sector can ill afford.  This has serious implications and grave repercussions for the retail sector both in Dublin and the provinces. Not only is there an added danger of physical injury to citizens, profits are reduced and jobs are placed at risk.  There are many reasons for the prevalence of crime, from underlying social problems to the allocation of resources to the Garda. However, the inadequacy of the legal system, which makes it difficult to secure convictions, is a crucial factor.  There is a low incidence of prosecutions of crimes against business, and most businesses are dissatisfied with the courts and sentencing.  These are clear weaknesses in the criminal justice system that must be addressed urgently.  The fundamental problem is that the system is weighted unfairly in favour of the accused.  I am by no means a member of the &ldquo;hang 'em, flog 'em&rdquo; brigade, though I may be close to it.  However, we must face reality. Advances have been made recently, but the odds of winning are on the side of the criminal rather than the law.  In Opposition, the Minister introduced a Private Members' Bill, during which I said:</P>
    <P>The misuse of drugs and their illicit sale and distribution is a creeping cancer in our society for which the only cure is surgery.  The practice of drug taking and profit making must be removed with clinical care and efficiency in clean and successful surgical strikes.  We must facilitate all the necessary agencies of the State to be able to carry out this surgery efficiently so that the people can survive.</P>
    <P>This Bill forms part of that surgical programme, and I applaud the Minister for sticking rigidly to the introduction of positive proposals which will combat the scourge of illegal drugs.  This Bill is a positive step towards providing the type of security which people demand and have a right to expect.  One of the major causes of drug related crime comes from the dealers and godfathers. Nobody can deny that someone trafficking in drugs to the value of £10,000 or more is not a dangerous criminal.  Those who traffic in drugs for profit should be shown no mercy and should incur the full rigours of the law.  Dealers must know that what they are selling on the streets and in back alleys, pubs and dance halls is possible death or a life of misery, dependence and insecurity.  In any other context they would be the outcasts of society.  I am pleased the Minister is bringing in special provisions to deal with such people.  We are not discussing junkies dealing on the street, but organised crime which must be met head on. Nobody can say that the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years is too harsh; there is too much at stake for the future, and too many lives are at risk.  A great deal of damage can be done by £10,000 worth of drugs, and the courts must <Col N="330" /> recognise that.  The Minister is giving them the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Without this mandatory sentencing, sentences would be at the discretion of the Judiciary.  We have had many past examples of wildly differing interpretations from judges of how harsh a sentence should be.  For example, some judges are quite happy with the two year ban for drink driving offences, while others differ.  In my area, one district court judge has often remarked that in certain circumstances he feels that the Probation Act should be applied in drink driving cases if it is a first offence.</P>
    <P>This type of inconsistency must be eliminated, and a comparison can be made between the courts system and the World Cup.  The judge is the arbiter in the courtroom whereas the referee is the arbiter on the field of play.  The referees were brought together in Paris before the World Cup to discuss the rules of the game and to ensure that their interpretations were similar in order to achieve a level of consistency.  Do our judges ever do this?  If not, they should consider doing so in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill also provides for speeding up trials, which appears to be an effort to accommodate the courts and the State.  That is not necessarily the case.  It is to the benefit of a defendant, particularly one who claims innocence, in that justice will be granted at an early date.  There is an old maxim &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; and this is an attempt to ensure that justice will be done as swiftly as possible and that cases will be heard within a reasonable period.  The provision whereby the book of evidence must be produced within seven weeks is also welcome, and will ensure that less serious cases will go ahead with all possible speed.  Criminals are the only people who will not be enamoured of these measures, as they want to postpone trials and sentencing as long as possible.</P>
    <P>I have always doubted the benefits of the necessity for preliminary examinations which take place in District Courts.  It has often provided an effective delaying tactic for the accused and given him or her time that has been put to bad use.  Under this measure, that procedure will be replaced with an immediate return to the court of trial.</P>
    <P>However, these measures do not simply facilitate the State or reduce the head start the criminal has on the legal system.  Section 5 contains an amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, which contains a provision whereby the court will have the power to take into account, when imposing sentences, whether the criminal was addicted to drugs at the time of the offence and whether that addiction was a substantial factor that led to the commission of the offence.  I applaud the Minister for including this compassionate provision.</P>
    <P>We cannot close our eyes to reality.  Addiction, not greed, is the cause of much city based crime. This is not to excuse that crime, but only a very hard society would close its eyes to the nuances <Col N="331" /> and facets of the drug problem.  Addiction can lead otherwise law-abiding people into a life of crime.  The elimination of the addiction leads to the elimination of the need to commit crimes, and many people who have given up drugs have gone on to be not just good citizens but experienced counsellors and role models for others caught in the web of drugs.</P>
    <P>It has long been recognised, not just by the Garda but by the communities it has served so well, that the place for a garda is on the street. More and more garda time is taken up with court appearances, to the detriment of community policing and detection.  I welcome the Minister's decision to keep the gardaí out of the courts as much as possible and to keep them on the streets, where confidence can be built.  Gardaí can now do much of their procedural work by written certificate rather than court appearances, and supervising garda officers will welcome the many thousands of working hours which will be available under the new system.  The proposal to eliminate the power of the Minister to commute sentences until after the minimum mandatory sentence has been served is also good.  Drug trafficking is such a serious crime and threat to society that we must remove any loopholes that could allow criminals off the hook.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a serious and genuine attempt to tackle serious crime.  It is a realistic attempt to make the courts more streamlined, effective and relevant to everyday life.  It is an attempt to make the best use of garda time and resources, allowing as many gardaí as possible back on the beat while still giving those accused of serious crime everything which is their due in courts of law.  It is also an attempt to marry the concepts of upholding the law and of giving the accused due process while showing compassion where it is called for. The Minister has the mix just about right and it is one more part of the comprehensive jigsaw of justice which he is assembling.  I applaud him and commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Gormley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general the changes being introduced are acceptable.  However, there is one change which is unnecessary.  It is cumbersome and will add considerably to the cost of the administration of justice.  Currently, if a person is charged with an indictable offence, a book of evidence is prepared and submitted to the District Court and the District Court justice decides whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case to answer.  If the District Court judge so holds, the defendant is then sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court.  That method of preliminary examination has worked well.  Under this Bill, however, it is proposed that immediately a person is charged he will be transferred to the Circuit Court.  A book of evidence will then be prepared by a Circuit Court judge who will decide whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> case.  If the Circuit Court so decides, the matter is sent to a different <Col N="332" /> Circuit Court judge to deal with same.  If it transpires that further depositions are required on the matter, the Act directs that these shall be taken in the District Court.  This amendment adds a further layer of bureaucracy and expense to the administration of justice.  The Circuit Court does not sit as often as the District Court.  Furthermore, there are fewer venues for Circuit Courts than for District Courts.  Accordingly, in country areas the fact that the preliminary examination takes place in the Circuit Court will incur additional travel and expenditure of time for practitioners, gardaí and other persons involved in the case.</P>
    <P>Something I would like to see is a specialised unit dealing with all aspects of business crime. Such a unit would act as a direct link between business and the Garda Síochána.  For it to be successful, it will be necessary to give consideration to various aspects from efficiency, education of gardaí involved in customer relations, giving advice and making assessments, to cost effective crime prevention measures.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána do a tremendous job in their day to day work.  I congratulate them specifically on the reduction in crime as reported in the latest statistics.  However, for the Garda to fully understand the requirements of dealing with business crime, I recommend that a pilot scheme be introduced for middle ranking gardaí above the level of inspector.  These gardaí could be seconded to private business as part of their professional development.  Gardaí involved in policy making can only really understand the needs of business if they have spent a considerable amount of time in the business environment.  Business related studies should form a greater part of Garda third level education.  Organised crime within business is a considerable risk to supermarkets, hotels etc.  A recent survey indicated that of 312 people, 79 per cent reported theft, vandalism, fraud, arson.  Banks, financial institutions, large supermarkets, hotels, petrol filling stations etc.  are vulnerable to highly organised crime.  The cost of preventative measures is quite prohibitive.  An alarm can cost up to £1,900; closed circuit TV can cost £5,800; hidden cameras cost up to £4,000; a time lock costs about £1,000; a floor safe can cost up to £800.  The average cost of preventative measures for an individual company can be £2,500.  The Garda Siochána do an excellent job, but a special Garda unit is necessary to deal with business crime which is becoming more organised.  The improved road structure encourages criminals to come from the larger cities to rural areas, particularly to places where it is clear that cash will be on hand.  The Minister should look at that.  RGDATA, the Small Firms Association and others have indicated the necessity of dealing with business crime.  I appeal to the Minister to consider giving tax relief on investment in security measures.  There is a very fine margin of survival in business of about 2 per cent. A carton of cigarettes costs about £30 and prosecution in the case of criminal activity in this area <Col N="333" /> is extremely rare.  The Minister should look at the possibility of allocating a member of the Garda in a district to deal exclusively with business crime.</P>
    <P>Rather than calling for new laws, the laws currently on the Statute Book should be rigorously applied to all forms of crime.  The resources of the courts should be increased in terms of judges, back-up staff and facilities so that crime can be dealt with quickly.  The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, despite its merits, does not go far enough.  One of the most significant ways in which offending while on bail could be reduced is by shortening the length of time an accused person is at liberty before trial.</P>
    <P>The victims of crime, retailers and staff, suffer a major shock when their operation is broken into.  It is an ever increasing problem.  There is very little support for victims of crime.  The Minister could look at the possibility of providing some resources for them.  Traditionally it was the custom for business people to live over their business premises, but many are quite apprehensive about doing that now, owing to the risk that they could be taken hostage and made to hand over the weekend's takings.</P>
    <P>My focus is on organised business crime.  This is a growing phenomenon which is becoming more organised by the day.  Crime is becoming big business and people who are involved in it are capable of getting away with it.  It is costly.  Any break-in causes a considerable amount of damage. Insurance often fails to meet claims owing to lack of evidence and the fact that it is hard to prove what amount of goods were taken, or to the inability of operators to pay the insurance costs which can be quite prohibitive as well.  I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on the matter, and I appeal to the Minister to take my points on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for sharing his time.  In addressing this Bill, it is appropriate to question the whole philosophy and ideology underlying zero tolerance.  Zero tolerance has become an expression of a set of beliefs around justice &mdash; that it must be adversarial, that it must be punitive, and that the number of prison places somehow indicates both the success of the criminal justice system and the potency of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The political philosophy of the Greens expresses a different understanding of these issues, and in the area of criminal justice our political philosophy finds expression in the concept of restorative justice.  Restorative justice views criminal conflict as an injury to personal relationships and the property of those involved.  It replaces punishment of the offender as the basis for justice.  It sets out to heal injuries of all parties involved in criminal conflict, victim, offender and community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime is a serious form of interpersonal conflict involving concrete harms.  Crime is only one type of interpersonal conflict.  An action becomes criminal when there is serious injury to a person <Col N="334" /> or property, and there is a failure to appreciate that the financial institution which fillets one's account for a few hundred pounds is just as much a criminal as the handbag snatcher who makes off with a tenner.</P>
    <P>In theory, our criminal justice system administers just, proportionate corrections that have a deterrent effect.  In practice it often fails to correct or deter, just as often making things worse as better.  Few offenders leave our prisons reformed or rehabilitated.  For the community the present system is costly both in fiscal terms and, more important, in terms of human destruction and degradation, and provides questionable value for money.  Furthermore, parties to crime other than offenders, the victim and the families of offender and victim frequently perceive themselves as marginal to and disempowered by the justice process.</P>
    <P>What has come to be widely realised in the period since the Victorian era is that prison does not actually work as a deterrent, as retribution or for rehabilitation.  The current edition of the <i>Bar Review</i> unequivocally asserts that all our prisons are monuments of inhumanity.  Members of the probation and welfare officers' union have demanded a moratorium on additional prison places.  Despite these indicators, the political will is expressed in signing the contracts to implement costly programmes to build new prisons.  This boosts the construction industry and adds to GNP but has no effect on the level of criminality in society.</P>
    <P>There has been increasing discussion in recent years of the need for a more victim-centred criminal justice system that emphasises redress and the deliberative control of justice by citizens, but the debate in Ireland has suffered from the lack of an overall alternative model for a new criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years, an increasingly influential world-wide alternative has emerged in the form of restorative justice theory.  Central to these models is the tenet that justice should be a process for making matters as right as possible rather than simply punishing offenders.</P>
    <P>The first question our current system asks is: how do we punish?  A restorative justice system asks: how do we repair the damage?  Restorative justice is most commonly defined by that to which it is an alternative.  Our current system incorporates justice and welfare models, retribution and rehabilitation.  It is primarily punitive, not rehabilitative.</P>
    <P>Restorative justice is a third model.  Its underlying theme is restoration of those affected by the offence.  The goal of the process is to heal the wounds of every person affected by the offence, including the victim and the offender.  To this extent it involves daring to be humane.  Its underlying perspective is that crime is primarily a violation of persons rather than an offence against the State.  Restorative justice defines crime as, first, an offence against human relationships and, second, a violation of law.</P>
    <P>In a restorative system, the primary focus is on <Col N="335" /> human violations and the need for healing and restoration of individuals and relationships.  As a system of justice, therefore, it is not punishment orientated but based rather on actions which attempt to repair the damage caused by the crime.  More fundamentally, restorative justice is a philosophical framework.  While the retribution model of justice is focused on public vengeance, deterrents and punishment through an adversarial process, restorative justice is concerned with repairing the harm done to victims and the community through a process of negotiation, mediation, victim empowerment and reparation.</P>
    <P>A United Nations working party on restorative justice has adopted the following working definition: restorative justice is a process whereby all the parties with a stake in a particular offence come together to resolve collectively how to deal with the aftermath of the offence and its implications for the future.</P>
    <P>Restorative justice encourages the victim and the offender to be directly involved in resolving any conflict through dialogue and negotiation.  In that way, the victim and the offender become central to the process with the State and legal professions becoming facilitators supporting a system which aims at offender accountability, full participation of both victim and offender and putting right the wrong.</P>
    <P>As against our current model of retribution, punishment and revenge, the restorative model fundamentally reinterprets the nature of crime and the response to it.  The social consequences of such a restorative justice model are that it could lower costs associated with incarceration, provide the victim with a sense that justice was served, provide offenders with a sense that the legal process has treated them fairly, redress the victim-offender relationships, make the community aware that it has a responsibility to both the offender and the victim and that it has ownership of the justice system.  I ask the Minister to indicate his views on such a system which is currently being applied in New Zealand on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>As we are dealing with the drug problem, I am aware that one drug has been responsible for 330,000 deaths and more than 4,000 murders in the past ten years in the United Kingdom.  That drug is alcohol and I believe we have ignored that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one criticism of the Bill. When the Minister first introduced this idea he was in Opposition and a member of the security committee and the drugs subcommittee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to reply to the debate.  This matter concerns dairy hygiene and the animal health requirements that will have to be certified on every dairy farm.  I agree with the system but I want to bring to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Health and Children the fact that this certification must be carried out on the farm by a veterinary surgeon.</P>
      <P>The veterinary surgeon must certify a number of matters.  First, that the animals do not show any sign of infectious diseases that could be transmitted to humans; second, that the general state of health is not impaired by any visible disorder; third, that the animals do not show any udder wounds likely to affect milk; fourth &mdash; and this is important &mdash; that the animals are not giving abnormal milk; and, fifth, that the animals are yielding at least two litres of milk per day and have not been treated with any dangerous substance.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the fourth requirement that the animals are not giving abnormal milk.  The local veterinary surgeons are very familiar with these dairy farms.  They visit them regularly to do cattle tests, help with difficult calving and attend to other matters.  Invariably they sell any required drugs to the farmers so there is a complete record of the drugs being used on the farms.</P>
      <P>Following a visual inspection, veterinary surgeons must sign a form stating that cows are not giving abnormal milk.  Unless a veterinary surgeon drew milk from every teat of every animal in that herd, he could not sign such a certificate.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter with the Minister last week in another context.  I hope the veterinary section in the Department of Agriculture and Food contacts the veterinary authorities in Europe, that is if they have any authority over this area, to ensure veterinary surgeons will be in a position to stand over any certificates they sign.  A number of veterinary practitioners came to me about this matter and said they have no problem with certifying dairy farmers whom they know well and who run their farms well, but that they could not lend their names to certification forms stating that cows do not produce bad quality milk.  How would those people know that was the case unless they were present when the cows were milked? The regulations should be changed because milk is tested at the milk processing plant and there is no danger that bad quality milk will get through the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> I read that the Minister has decided to defer the certification <Col N="337" /> requirements for another year.  That will give us an opportunity to come back to this matter again. It is not possible for a veterinary practitioner to sign the certification form unless he or she stays with the cows day and night.  I hope when arrangements are made between the Irish Veterinary Union and farmers, there will not be a huge fee for certification.  The cost should be integrated with payment for the annual test.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for raising this matter and apologise for my colleague, Deputy Walsh, who is unavailable to reply.</P>
      <P>The rules for the hygienic production of milk and dairy products throughout the European Union are set out in Council regulation &mdash; EEC &mdash; and its associated directives.  This EU legislation is given legal effect in Ireland by S.l. No. 9 of 1996.  This is very comprehensive legislation which covers everything from the animal health of the milking animals to the labelling of finished products leaving the processing plants.</P>
      <P>The requirements in relation to the animal health status of dairy herds is set down in Regulation 9 of S.l. No. 9 of 1996.  To put in place a scheme for the certification of dairy herds under that regulation, the Department conducted detailed discussions with representatives of all parties concerned, the farming organisation, the co-operatives and the veterinary organisations. Resulting from those discussions a form of certification was drawn up which was to be signed by the farmer and a veterinary practitioner and forwarded to the concern to which producers supplied milk.  There are essentially two elements involved in the certificate, a farmer's declaration and veterinary certification.</P>
      <P>Certain practical difficulties emerged with the implementation of the scheme and, despite further discussions, the matter has not yet been resolved.  However, to allow for the additional time which will be required to try to resolve the matter satisfactorily, it has been decided to defer the date by which certification must be completed until 31 December 1998.  This will allow further discussion to take place with all parties.  As part of those discussions, the casting of the certificate will be re-examined, with the responsibilities of the parties involved, in respect of the various declarations contained in the certificate.</P>
      <P>The two points mentioned by the Deputy are matters which will be covered in the certification and will, of course, be included in the forthcoming discussions.  In the Minister's view, these are both important points in ensuring milk is safe, wholesome and of a quality which is, rightly, expected by the modern consumer.</P>

      <P>The people of Donegal learned with great shock last Saturday of the fire in Lovell and Christmas in Ballymoney.  Since that was the largest slaughtering facility in Ireland, catering for 5,000 pigs from the Republic, it is a serious loss not only to Donegal but to the Republic.  Some 1,500 animals per week were brought to that plant from Donegal.  Without that facility pig producers are experiencing grave difficulties.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to address this matter in the near future.</P>
      <P>While I would say rather flippantly that there were two recent incidents in England where pigs escaped from slaughterhouses, there are serious repercussions for pig producers here.  Some 85 per cent of pigs produced in Donegal went into the plant in Ballymoney.  There is a possibility that McCarren's plant in Cavan, which had a killing capacity of 8,000 animals per week, will be reopened.  There is such a facility, Western Meats, in Dromad and Dromone Meats in Oldcastle has a killing capacity of 3,000 animals per week. There are difficulties, however, with the export plant status.</P>
      <P>The red tape should be cut in terms of getting those facilities up and running.  There are huge cost implications involved for pig producers in Donegal who have to bring their animals to other facilities.  There are difficulties in that the cost of producing pigs is high when compared to the price paid by factories.  I could outline at length the difficulties faced by pig producers, but the most immediate consideration is to get facilities up and running to address the day to day problem. I hope the Minister will have good news, if not today, in the near future.  There is an opportunity for job creation in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a short contribution on the serious difficulties facing pig producers.  The problems are of particular relevance in my county where pig farming constitutes a major segment of the farming industry.  On other occasions in this House I highlighted the absolute need to ensure pig production is not confined to largescale units.  Every measure must be taken to ensure small pig producing units are maintained and that the smallscale producer is protected.  Successive Governments have given insufficient attention to ensure pig production is not confined to largescale units.  For the future well-being of the industry, the smallscale producer must be protected.  A mix of pig slaughtering facilities, large and small, is needed.  It would be detrimental to the industry to have a small number of largescale slaughtering plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> A number of problems contribute to the present crisis facing pig producers.  Can the Department counteract the effects of the importation of six to seven containers of processed product to this country each week?  The difficulties with the Japanese currency have cut off the market for the heavy pig product.  An immediate problem arose this week because of the fire at Lovell and Christmas.  There is now a major oversupply of live pigs to all slaughtering plants, with not enough market outlets for pigmeat.</P>
    <P>McCarren's bacon curers in Cavan closed in early 1996 after trading successfully since 1860. McCarren and Company provided very valuable employment for generations of families in County Cavan and those skilled employees processed product to the highest standard.  The difficulties encountered at that plant since 1996 have, thankfully, been resolved and I hope the plant will reopen at an early date.  The opening of that facility would be most beneficial, not only to the employees but to pig producers in the region.  I appeal to the Department to ensure the necessary veterinary and departmental personnel are assigned to that plant as quickly as possible to facilitate its earliest possible reopening.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider a number of measures to help the pig producing industry. Prices at farm level should be monitored by an independent body.  Now is the time to forego all levies until the crisis eases.  The Government should increase the VAT repayment rate to be paid directly to farmers.  This is a time for action when one considers that the market realisable value of the pig has dropped by £4 in the past week.  There is an 8 per cent oversupply in the European Union.  Irish producers have increased the supply in line with the An Bord Bia target.  The price paid to producers has dropped by 25 per cent in the past 18 months whereas the retail price has risen by 8.7 per cent.  The pig producer and the farmer are the sufferers in this case.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague from Cavan, Deputy Brendan Smith, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important issue which he and Deputy Keaveney raised.  Deputy McGinley would have liked to speak if time had permitted but we realise it was not possible.  The situation is very serious but it is nobody's fault. As Deputy Smith said, successive Governments have failed to recognise the fact that no slaughtering facilities to speak of are available in the Border region.  We beg the Minister to ensure existing facilities are put into operation immediately. The Minister, the Department and An Bord Bia must do whatever they can to alleviate the crisis which will result in the industry.  As Deputy Smith said, prices have already fallen significantly and more so in the Border region.  We should work on a cross-party basis to ensure pig farmers in the Border regions survive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister thanks Deputies Smith, Keaveney, Crawford and McGinley for bringing this matter to his attention.  Coming from a Border county as well, it is also a matter of concern to me.  In 1996 two pig slaughtering plants closed in the Cavan-Monaghan area when management took a commercial decision to cease operations in both cases.  The two plants concerned were McCarrens of Cavan and Dawn Pork and Bacon, Coolshannagh, County Monaghan, which between them were slaughtering 9, 000 pigs per week.</P>
      <P>Since that time, there has been no reduction in slaughtering capacity in the pigmeat industry south of the Border.  In fact, some EU approved slaughtering plants have come into production taking back some of the capacity lost in 1996. Information given to the Department of Agriculture and Food from its veterinary officers based at EU approved plants indicates that delays may sometimes occur, but they are attributable, in most cases, to plant machinery breaking down or suppliers bringing pigs for slaughter outside of the allocated delivery time.  Slaughterings at EU approved pigmeat plants in 1997 amounted to 2.76 million head, an increase of nearly 7 per cent over the 1996 figure.  The industry was able to cope with this increase without any difficulty.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of last year allegations were made in the press that there was a lack of slaughtering capacity at pigmeat plants.  The Department of Agriculture and Food at the time carried out a survey of EU approved pigmeat slaughtering plants and found that the level of slaughterings, which I already said were running about 7 per cent higher than in 1996, were adequately catered for.  There was spare capacity.  Similar independent surveys carried out around the same time by both Forbairt and the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors, confirmed the Department's findings that current slaughtering capacity at EU approved pigmeat plants is adequate to meet demands.</P>
      <P>In recent days, a fire destroyed a large pigmeat slaughtering plant in Northern Ireland, which was sourcing some of its supplies south of the Border. So far there is no indication that this will cause difficulties for slaughtering plants in the South. There are a number of other large slaughtering plants in Northern Ireland which may intervene and increase slaughterings but, as I already indicated, there is spare capacity in the South, which will be capable of dealing with increased slaughterings if necessary.</P>
      <P>The closure of McCarrens and Dawn Pork and Bacon in 1996 has, however, meant that the north and the north-east parts of the country do not have a slaughtering plant.  The area has a very long tradition in pig production and producers in some cases have to send their pigs long distances to the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food fully recognises that this is not an ideal situation and his Department, in liaison with Forbairt, has made all its resources available to try to encourage <Col N="341" /> a resumption of operations at the plants concerned. Regrettably, Dawn Pork and Bacon will not reopen.  As far as McCarrens is concerned, the position is not clear.  Some discussions between McCarrens management and Forbairt have taken place in the past, but with no positive outcome.  The door remains open to McCarrens if it wishes to discuss resumption of operations of the plant, but the final decision on re-opening rests with management which must make a commercial decision in that regard.  It is not open to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to intervene directly in the matter.  The Minister is encouraged, however, by the fact that a long standing industrial relations dispute with the unions at the McCarrens plant has recently been resolved.</P>
    <P>Under current EU rules, it is not possible for member states to give direct national aid to assist the setting up of slaughtering facilities in the pigmeat sector.  I assure the Deputies, however, that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will continue to monitor the situation and will keep in contact with Forbairt about its efforts to restore the processing capacity in the Border region to a satisfactory level.  Ultimately, however, the setting up of new slaughtering facilities, or the resumption of operations at existing ones, rests in the commercial field.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise an important issue which has been conveniently glossed over by the establishment parties of this House and, as a consequence, has been virtually ignored by the media.  This typifies the way politics and the media interact.  If the five establishment parties agree on or decide to play dumb on an issue, the media does not give it the attention it deserves.</P>
      <P>The people who claim the &ldquo;pick me up&rdquo; system is not that serious are the same people who believe tax evasion is not that serious.  This is a prevalent view given that for the first time in the history of our State an individual was recently convicted for tax evasion in Galway Circuit Court and got a suspended sentence.  This individual had £500,000 in an Isle of Man account.  This view can also be seen from the fact that people at the highest levels of our society have accounts in Ansbacher, NIB and AIB with the intention of evading tax.  They were actively encouraged by bank officials in this regard.  It has even been reported that an eminent judge had money invested in one of these schemes, which, perhaps, accounts for the judicial leniency in relation to tax evasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the remark. Following on from all these scandals, we have been told that political parties in their fund raising <Col N="342" /> efforts encouraged tax evasion.  Companies which wished to encourage the democratic process picked up the tab for printing or advertising work for parties.  These invoices were sent to the companies by a printing or advertising company friendly with the party.  This had a number of advantages for the company and the political party.  It enabled them to keep the political donation a secret and it also meant they could write-off the amount against tax and save money on VAT.  It is what is known as a win win situation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, however, there are losers when it comes to tax evasion.  The ordinary decent PAYE worker loses out because he or she must pick up the tab for the rest of society.  In reality, tax evasion means fewer hospital beds, teachers for schools and bad public transport.  That is the unspoken reality of tax evasion.  For many years we were told that millions of pounds of unpaid taxes could not be accounted for, that there was some mysterious black hole.  The tax amnesty and the latest revelations show the reason is much more simple.  There was widespread tax evasion. The pick-me-up scheme first came to light when the famous Fitzwilton donation of £30,000, which was originally intended for Irish Printers for work for Fianna Fáil, was subsequently paid to Mr. Ray Burke.  The Taoiseach has now said he intends to clean up the way in which parties are financed through the pick-me-up scheme.</P>

      <P>Would there have been an attempt to clean this up if the Government had not been caught?  The core of this issue is that some reputable Irish firms &mdash; which are known by name, and others whose names have yet to emerge &mdash; got themselves involved in schemes dreamt up and operated by leading political parties, the same political parties who have had responsibility for running the State.  If such firms had the nod from the representatives of a high office holder in respect of this tax scam, what signal was that business picking up in relation to other aspects of statutory compliance and, for instance, in its approach to the business of tendering for public sector contracts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out and substantially accepted that the tax savings to the companies which were implicated in the scam would not have been exceptionally large but the real and permanent harm which pick-me-up schemes have caused has been in creating a belief among some <Col N="343" /> businesses, large and small, that they were not like their peers and had the inside track.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance sincerely regrets he cannot be here to respond to Deputy Gormley's Adjournment matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy refers to the wide deployment of the &ldquo;pick-me-up&rdquo; system of party political funding and the allegation that the practice has facilitated tax evasion.  I cannot speak for the other parties, but the Taoiseach has recently asked the Revenue Commissioners to examine payments made to Fianna Fáil in this way, with a view to identifying whether there has been an underpayment of tax in any case.</P>
      <P>This matter came to light initially in Fianna Fáil headquarters in March during the process of a trawl for the purposes of furnishing an affidavit to the Flood Tribunal.  Information also came to light in the context of Fianna Fáil preparing its returns for the Public Offices Commission.  The accountant noticed that certain donations were accounted for differently to others.</P>
      <P>Some donations were represented by an invoice rather than by a receipt, and this brought to light that the donation may have been made as a &ldquo;pick-me-up&rdquo;.  A party official brought the issue to the Taoiseach's attention on 31 March.  The Taoiseach immediately ordered that the practice be stopped.  He was also adamant that the matter be rectified.  The Taoiseach also directed that those involved in fund raising indicate, as a matter of course, that political contributions are not tax deductible.  Finally, he directed that past donations be examined to ensure that they did not involve an underpayment of tax.</P>
      <P>In early June, the Taoiseach directed that the Revenue Commissioners be contacted at the highest level and requested to examine Fianna Fáil's funding practice.  A meeting was arranged between the Fianna Fáil accountant and the chief inspector of taxes to initiate the examination.</P>

      <P>The Deputy comes from a party, some of whose supporters have tried to sabotage some of our national industries.  It is a bit rich of the Deputy to interrupt while I make my contribution.</P>
      <P>As regards taxation, the tax code does not allow relief in respect of financial support for politicians, political parties or any of their members.  Political contributions are not allowable in the calculation of income tax or corporation tax liabilities and a VAT credit in respect of relevant expenditure is not allowable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> On the &ldquo;pick-me-up&rdquo; mechanism, Revenue has been conducting an inquiry into all taxation aspects of the matter.  Revenue is in communication with the various persons concerned.  It is precluded, in accordance with the ordinary confidentiality constraints, from commenting on the tax affairs of any person or body.  The outcome of its inquiries cannot be anticipated, nor can tax evasion be presumed in any case, but it may be assumed that Revenue will take whatever action is necessary as regards compliance with taxation legislation.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act have greatly increased the level of transparency in the funding of individual politicians and political parties.  Proposals for the Standards in Public Office Bill are now before Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide for the Standards in Public Office Commission, which will have the authority and powers to investigate the conduct of public business.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and the House can be assured the appropriate action has been taken in this case and I hope this meets the concerns of all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is a headline from one of the national newspapers on Monday, 18 May: &ldquo;Three Teenagers Feared Drowned off Sligo.&rdquo; The prediction, sadly, proved correct when the bodies of three young men were recovered from the sea.  The three friends were non swimmers and got into difficulty while wading in the water off Strandhill in County Sligo.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, on a visit to the tragic location, promised the Government would try to ensure there is never a repeat of this accident.  Serious questions have been raised about water safety here but sadly it has taken a tragedy such as this to focus the minds of people.</P>
      <P>The Sligo accident has cast a cloud over the standard of swimming education in the State.  Of the four teenagers who got into difficulty, none could swim, let alone practice life-saving techniques. There is a public policy in the UK that everyone learns to swim from the age of eight.  A similar co-ordinated policy is badly needed here but such a policy cannot be implemented without the provision of adequate facilities.</P>
      <P>The three teenagers from Sligo lived on the border of County Roscommon, one of whom attended school in Ballaghaderreen.  The same school has an application with the Minister's Department for the provision of a swimming pool.  There is a large hinterland around the town and there is an equal distance from the towns of Castlerea and Boyle.  More than 800 second level students attend the local school and there is a great need for a pool in the locality.  The people of the town have raised more than £250,000 towards the provision of this pool but the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has failed to provide funding for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two further applications are on the Minister's <Col N="345" /> desk: namely the refurbishment of Castlerea and Roscommon town swimming pools.  The only indoor swimming pool in the county, which is in Roscommon town, is in a deplorable condition. There is major concern that if funding is not provided immediately the pool will have to close for good at the end of the year due to the infrastructure being outdated and substandard.  Each year the pool closes to the public for three months as funding for the running of it has been exhausted. Last November the pool closed in the middle of a swimming lesson course for children.  How can this ensure there is never a repeat of the accident in Sligo, as stated by the Taoiseach?</P>
    <P>The pool's list of defects include a roof constructed of asbestos, an air ventilation system which is inoperable, a water heating and filter system which should more appropriately be housed in the National Museum, and changing facilities which are substandard.  The icing on the cake is that the water level is maintained by means of a direct flow tap as the pool is leaking.  The local sub aqua club, which does a tremendous job in search and rescue in the county, use the pool for training.  As the Minister is aware this organisation is vitally important to a county such as Roscommon which borders on the Rivers Suck and Shannon.  However, when the pool is closed its members must travel to Ballinasloe pool which is more than 30 miles away.  This is putting increased financial pressure on a voluntary organisation which is inadequately funded.</P>
    <P>The third application on the Minister's desk is for the refurbishment of Castlerea swimming pool.  This is an outdoor pool and the funding required is modest in the overall budget for swimming pools.  The pool was erected by the local community, through their own persistence.  They are now seeking a helping hand from the Government to carry out works, including the refurbishment of changing facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise the community spirit of the people of Castlerea by providing the required funds.  It is a disgrace that a county surrounded by water does not have a proper swimming pool.  It is a disgrace that the Government is to fund a 50-metre swimming pool without funding 25-metre pools adequately.  The Minister must urgently approve these applications and ensure this work is done as soon as possible.  I am aware the Minister has only recently assumed responsibility for swimming pools.  I appeal to his sense of fair play to provide funds as soon as possible for County Roscommon.  I acknowledge and thank the Minister for attending to hear my case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for raising the issue and I extend my sympathies to the families and friends of the young people involved in the recent tragic accident in County Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport contributes in a unique way to the social and economic development of Ireland and it has a significant and enriching impact on our culture and identity.  The Government has brought a new <Col N="346" /> drive and momentum to the development of sport.  A series of measures has been adopted to drive forward this development.  Essential to the success of this approach is that all elements are developed in an integrated and unified manner.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's recognition of the value of sport and leisure to the physical and mental health of each individual, especially in the role they can play in fostering a sense of community identity, even in the most deprived areas, I have set a goal for my Department to formulate and oversee the implementation of policies for the promotion and development of sport and to encourage increased participation in sport and recreation, particularly by disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>To achieve this goal I have set a number of key objectives: to develop a new policy framework for the promotion and development of sport and recreation; to promote a more strategic approach to the use of available resources for sport and recreation by a sector driven mainly by voluntary effort; to develop a new holistic system of supports for high performance by athletes; to help overcome the isolating effects of social exclusion in disadvantaged areas by developing appropriate sport and recreational strategies for those areas; and to encourage the promotion of standards of good conduct and fair play in sport.</P>
    <P>As regards funding, I am pleased to say that I have been able to secure a doubling in Government funding for sport from £13 million in 1997 to £26 million this year.  As the first Cabinet Minister with responsibility for sport, I am proud that this is the largest annual budget ever allocated by a Government for assisting development in sport.</P>
    <P>The development of a quality infrastructure is crucial to the future of sport.  In this context, the swimming pool programme, the administration of which recently transferred to my Department, is very important.  Under this programme, which provides national lottery funding for swimming pools, my Department pays grants of up to 100 per cent of the approved cost of refurbishing existing pools and up to 80 per cent of the approved cost of new swimming pools, with the remainder of the cost being funded by local contribution. Applications for funding under the programme must be submitted via the local authority supporting the project.</P>
    <P>To qualify for a grant, a pool must comply with the Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines.  The commitment of funds to a project can only be considered when the project design has been approved and the local authority is in a position to accept a tender.  The overall allocation for the swimming pool programme and the competing demands of other pool projects for the available funds must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Preliminary proposals for the provision of a new pool at Ballaghaderreen by the Ballaghaderreen Swimming Pool Committee were submitted through Roscommon County Council to the then Department of the Environment in July 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The proposed pool is estimated to cost in the region of £1.5 million at 1994 prices.  The local swimming pool committee raised £200,000 towards the project.  At the same time, Roscommon County Council submitted preliminary proposals to the then Department of the Environment for major refurbishment works to the existing public pool in Roscommon town costing £1.5 million.  In July 1995 the swimming pool committee was informed that, due to limited capital resources, the Department of the Environment would not be able to fund both projects simultaneously. Given that there was already an existing pool in need of refurbishment in Roscommon, priority was given to its proposed refurbishment.</P>
    <P>Roscommon town swimming pool was constructed in the mid-1970s.  As with many pools of a similar age, it is now in need of major refurbishment. Roscommon County Council proposes to completely refurbish the pool and provide additional ancillary facilities at an estimated cost of £1.5 million at 1994 prices.</P>
    <P>Contract documents for Roscommon town pool were submitted to the Department of the Environment in October 1996.  While these documents have been technically approved by the Department of the Environment and Local Government's technical advisers, because of existing commitments under the swimming pool programme it has not been possible to allow the council to proceed to the next stage of the project &mdash; the seeking of tenders &mdash; as this would require a definite funding commitment from the Department.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £4 million in my Department's Estimates for 1998 for the swimming pool <Col N="348" /> programme.  While this represents a substantial increase on the 1996 and 1997 provisions of £2 million and £3.5 million respectively, the 1998 provision is fully committed to approved projects under construction or on which construction is expected to commence shortly.  These projects also give rise to commitments of some £6 million in 1999.  In addition, the cost of swimming pool projects has risen considerably over the past few years because of general increases in construction costs and the higher standard of facilities provided. There are also a number of further applications for funding at various stages of planning which amount to over £48 million.  I am not in a position to say when a firm financial commitment can be given to the funding of the proposed works at Roscommon pool.</P>
    <P>There will always be limits on the funding available.  Therefore, it is vital that the promotion of sport and the development of facilities is carried out in a strategic and focused way, which means establishing priorities, avoiding overlaps and ensuring full access to available facilities. There are public policies in the UK in the area of swimming which I would like to see implemented here.  The administration of swimming pools has been treated in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  On a certain 50 mile stretch of road, there are four swimming pools, while the Deputy's county and other areas have very few or none.  Unfortunately, this is the situation which exists at the moment.  I recognise the spirit in which the Deputy has raised the matter and the spirit of those involved in the area of swimming.  If more funding becomes available, we will re-examine the proposal.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for asylum in this State received up to 19 June 1998 is 2,468.  To date in 1998, 22 persons have been served with deportation orders.  To date in 1998, there have been a total of 21 deportations. In one case the deportation order was served but not effected arising from a judicial review of the case.  The person involved was illegally remaining in the State.  The deportation orders effected can be divided as follows: removals under Dublin Convention: 11; Failed asylum seekers: 3; Illegal immigrants: 5; and, EU nationals removed on public policy/order grounds: 2; at present the Garda have 15 deportation orders for implementation. As regards the implementation of the Refugee Act, 1996 I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question Numbers 108 and 109 of 28 May, 1998.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of the right of asylum seekers to work, while their applications are pending, applicants for refugee status are not permitted to engage in employment.  They are, however, issued with appropriate documentation to enable them to claim supplementary welfare allowance during that period.</P>
      <P>While the matter of allowing asylum seekers to work is essentially a question of employment policy, it must be borne in mind that asylum seekers only have temporary permission to remain in the State pending the determination of their applications.  Where their applications are successful they will be allowed to remain in the State and work without restriction.  However, where applications are unsuccessful, the applicants, if not permitted to remain for other reasons, will have to leave the State.  I do not think that it would be appropriate to allow people with only a temporary permission to remain in the State to be allowed to work and put down roots in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons put forward for allowing asylum seekers to work is the length of time taken to process their applications.  I would hope that one of the positive aspects of new procedures <Col N="350" /> for processing asylum claims which have been introduced will be that the processing of applications should be considerably speeded up.  A successful applicant will then have a right to work without restriction.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 24, 27, 29, 42, 46, 58 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware the position is that intoxicating liquor cannot be sold in this country without a licence.  However, as the Deputies will appreciate, the liquor licensing laws comprise a comprehensive and complex body of legislation. Licences may be divided into different categories and are issued on the fulfilment of certain conditions provided for in the licensing laws, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Finance Acts.</P>
      <P>It has not been possible, in the short period available between receipt of the questions and today, to assemble the information sought by the Deputies.  However, l can say that the Department is in touch with the Revenue Commissioners with a view to obtaining the necessary information.  When it is available l will write to the Deputies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>The specific question of separate legal representation in the course of trials is usually raised in the context of complainants in cases of rape and other sexual assaults.  This issue, and the issues surrounding the introduction of a sex offenders or paedophile register, are addressed in the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences which I published on 26 May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the discussion paper is to stimulate debate on the laws relating to sexual offences, including the specific issues raised in the Deputies' questions and to encourage interested groups and individuals to respond with their considered views on the wide range of issues dealt with in the paper.  Those responses should be made to my Department before 28 August 1998 and will be taken fully into account in the framing <Col N="352" /> of any new legislation which will ensue from the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of separate legal representation, l am concerned to ensure that crime victims do receive the support they need in court cases and this general issue will be addressed in the context of the new charter on victims of crime which is currently being prepared in my Department.</P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997 was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May of last year.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act, or any particular provision or provisions of it, will come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have informed the House in response to previous questions that the provisions of the Act have not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  I am sure that all Members of the House would agree that we need to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.  I have also indicated to the House that I was keeping the matter under continuous review the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison for 400 beside Wheatfield.  It remains the case that prison accommodation is not yet adequate to bring the provisions of the Bail Act generally into force at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, section 10 of the Act has already been brought into operation with effect from 2 June 1998.  That section amends section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 with the aim of strengthening its provisions in relation to the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
      <P>As to other provisions of the Act, I will continue to keep the matter under review with a view to bringing them into operation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Operation Dóchas, Operation Main Street and Operation Clean Street have been very effective on a number of fronts and have resulted in: increased Garda visibility and presence in key areas; improved relations with local communities; a more focused approach to the drug problem; increased awareness among the public of the extent of the problem and the dangers involved; and improved information flow among all involved.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that since the commencement of Operation Dóchas in October 1996 drugs to the value of over £7 million have been seized on the streets of Dublin, over 21,000 arrests have been made and 10,060 persons have been charged.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also informed me that, under Operation Clean Street, 100 on street heroin dealers have been identified, 70 of whom have been arrested and charged under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977-84 with possession with intent to supply.  In addition, 30 persons face prosecution.  Under this operation, cash to the total of £2,240 and 170 deals of heroin and 19 deals of cannabis resin, with a total value of over £5,000, have been seized.  This operation is intelligence driven and other areas within the DMA will be targeted in future stages of this operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also advised by the Garda authorities that, under Operation Main Street, which is concentrated in the O'Connell Street area of the DMA: approximately 2,000 persons have been detained for the purposes of search, pursuant to the provisions of section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977-84; 189 persons have been arrested, pursuant to section 25 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977-84 on suspicion of having committed an offence contrary to Section 15 of those Acts with possession for the purpose of supply; 109 persons have been charged with offences committed contrary to section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977-84; 16 persons have been charged with offences committed contrary to section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977-84 with possession of a controlled drug; and 88 files are in the process of being prepared for forwarding to the DPP for <Col N="354" /> his direction as to what charges, if any, should be initiated against suspected drug dealers.</P>
    <P>During the course of Operation Main Street, heroin with an estimated street value of over £240,000, has been seized in addition to other controlled substances, with an estimated street value of £16,000.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the effectiveness of these operations is continuously under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons convicted by the courts of offences involving violence against women or children may, as in the case of other crimes, be made subject to supervision by the probation and welfare service or may be committed to a term of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The probation and welfare service does not operate programmes dedicated solely to dealing with violence against women and children but anger management or attitudes to violence is an integral core module in several projects organised by the service.  The intention is to address the origins and violent manifestations of offending. Every offender participating in any of these programmes is exposed to this module and results show significant attitudinal change in the majority of offenders completing the course.</P>
      <P>At Mountjoy Prison a programme called The Alternatives To Violence Programme has been running for the past four years.  It is delivered by a small number of volunteer workers including members of the Society of Friends.  Programmes are aimed at confronting individual prisoners' propensity to violence and helping them overcome their violent tendencies.  There continues to be a high level of interest in these programmes which are run over a weekend.  Each session is restricted to 20 and in all some 500 inmates have participated to date.  Similar programmes have commenced recently in Limerick Prison and Wheatfield place of detention.</P>
      <P>A new non-therapeutic programme for offenders, the thinking skills training programme, was introduced in Arbour Hill Prison earlier this year.  It is hoped to introduce a similar programme in Cork Prison in the near future.  The thinking skills programme is designed to target a range of offenders including those convicted of sex offences and other offences involving violence against women and children.  The programme is run by multi-disciplinary teams, including prison officers, probation and welfare staff and teaching staff under the guidance of my</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> Department's clinical psychology service.  The skills addressed in this new programme include: general strategies for recognising problems, analysing them and considering non-criminal and non-violent alternatives; how to consider the consequences of their behaviour including violent behaviour &mdash; to think before they act; how to go beyond their own view of the world and consider the thoughts and feelings of other people; and how to develop the ability to control their own behaviour and avoid acting impulsively and violent.</P>
    <P>Acts of violence against women and children can be of a sexual nature.  Within the prison system there are, at present, two forms of therapeutic intervention available to all prisoners committed for such sex offences.  Both forms of treatment are aimed at enabling such offenders gain a measure of control over their offending behaviour.</P>
    <P>The first is individual counselling from my Department's clinical psychology service and from the probation and welfare service.  This form of therapeutic intervention is available in each institution to sex offenders who seek it, with the temporary exception of those in the Curragh place of detention where it will be provided at the earliest opportunity.  The number of offenders who have received this type of treatment cannot readily be quantified without a comprehensive survey which is not feasible at present.  However, l can say that this service is provided to all offenders who seek it.</P>
    <P>The second type of therapeutic intervention is a highly intensive psycho-therapeuautic group treatment programme aimed specifically at addressing the conscious and unconscious motivation of sex offenders.  It has been operating at Arbour Hill Prison for the past four years.</P>
    <P>This programme can cater for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete.  The emphasis is on the offender accepting personal responsibility for the offence and on developing effective relapse prevention strategies.  All convicted sex offenders who are in custody, irrespective of the institution in which they are accommodated, are invited to apply to participate in the programme.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are deemed suitable.  Where more than ten offenders who have applied are deemed suitable, the places on the programme are allocated to those nearest the end of their sentence.  The others are offered a place on a subsequent programme. To date 40 prisoners have participated in this programme with the fourth group due to finish in July next.  A further group will begin the programme in the autumn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 28, 32, 38, 69, 85 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The 1997-1998 Prison Chaplains' Annual Report was received by me on Tuesday, 19 May 1998.  In preparing their report, the prison chaplains understandably place overriding emphasis on the spiritual and personal welfare of prisoners. Their unique positions within the prison system gives them a valuable oversight of conditions in our penal institutions.  Accordingly, due regard must be given to their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 79 recommendations in this report and from an initial examination it would appear that few of the issues raised are new; some relate to important policy issues which will require detailed consideration.  The more general issues <Col N="358" /> include rehabilitation, overcrowding, poor conditions, drug abuse, medical, psychiatric and psychological services etc.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the major issues of overcrowding and inadequate prison conditions are being addressed not only by way of extensive building and refurbishment programmes but also in terms of the ongoing development of alternatives to custody in line with the commitment in the programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I have commented on previous occasions on many of the other issues raised including the drug problem in the prisons and on efforts to deal with it by reducing both the demand and the supply.  I accept that much work remains to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of rehabilitation and specifically where sex offenders are concerned I am keen to expand the number of treatment places available.  In this regard my Department is actively examining the possibility of increasing the number of group treatment places available by locating a further group treatment programme for ten sex offenders at the Curragh.  However, in view of the specialised skills and the resources necessary to set up and run such a programme it will take some time to put a new programme in place.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important to provide a standard of health care for offenders which is equivalent to that available in the general community.  In this context, the new doctor's contract has been accepted by all but three prison medical officers. The implementation of this new contract will serve to improve primary medical care for prisoners. In addition a proposed service agreement with the Eastern Health Board, which will lead to the assignment of a number of dedicated psychiatrists, should lead to an improvement in the level of treatment available within the prison service to those inmates who suffer from psychiatric disorders or mental illness.</P>
    <P>There are many recommendations in the report to which I have not specifically referred.  As I have said already these will be taken into account in future policy development generally and, in particular, in relation to humane custody.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 30, 80, 84, 110, 112 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the course of the Dáil motion on racism on 17 December last, the Government categorically rejects racism in all its forms.  On that occasion I emphasised that those who genuinely need protection in the State and are entitled to that protection would receive it.</P>
      <P>In the light of the Government decision to accept the recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee on Immigration, Asylum and Related Issues that &ldquo;all appropriate assistance should be given by the relevant public bodies to facilitate the integration into Irish society of persons recognised as refugees or given leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds&rdquo;, my Department is in consultation with others with a view to ensuring the provision of such assistance.  The Refugee Agency which is under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs provides such a service for programme refugees. A recent review of the agency suggested a wider role for the agency to include all refugees.  This is being examined at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initiatives to counter racist attitudes were carried out in the context of the work of the National Co-ordinating Committee for European year Against Racism (1997), which received financial support from, and operated under the aegis of my <Col N="360" /> Department.  It also served as a forum for interdepartmental consultation.  The committee was representative of Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science, Health and Children, Foreign Affairs, Social, Community and Family Affairs and Environment and Local Government, state agencies working in the area of racism, non-governmental organisations and trade unions.</P>
    <P>I am establishing a National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism to advise the Government on matters relating to racism and to reinforce and develop initiatives commenced during 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained in responding to a number of questions from the Deputy in the past, the outcome of the review which I carried out was presented to Government in the form of an <i>aide memoire.</i>  It is not the practice to publish formal ministerial submissions to Government.</P>

    <P>I will, however, make the substances of what emerged from the review of the scheme, together with all the statistical and other information which was appended to the <i>aide memoire,</i> available for circulation with the Official Report.  This information is essentially what was extracted from the case files during the review.  I am not, however, in a position to release information which would either involve a breach of Cabinet confidentiality, disclose confidential legal advice from the Attorney General to this or previous Governments, potentially affect our international relations or, in accordance with long standing <Col N="362" /> practice, breach the understanding of confidentiality with which individuals have dealt with my Department.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Summary</P>
    <P Just="Center">Review of Investment based Naturalisation Scheme 10 February 1998</P>
    <P>The Scheme was intended to assist the then IDA in attracting inward investment especially in attracting manufacturing industry.  The introduction of such a Scheme had been advocated by successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce throughout the 1980's but opposed by successive Ministers for Justice on policy grounds.</P>
    <P>In April 1989, the then Minister decided to seek Government approval in relation to a particular proposal which involved a large number of applications.  The Government decided that the applications should be approved and, furthermore, so should future applications for anybody who was prepared to invest in the State.</P>
    <P>Around this time, a Statement in Intent (Appendix A) was made available to persons who enquired about naturalisation linked to investment.</P>
    <P>Over the period 1988 to 1994, the range of investments made under the Scheme widened from industrial development (which appears to have been envisaged during the early days of the Scheme) to include, for example, some property and forestry development and the shipping sector.  In this period, 66 investors (plus 39 spouses and children) were naturalised. By and large, the main elements of the Statement of Intent were complied with.  Details are set out in tabular form at Appendix B.</P>
    <P>The guidelines at Appendix C were introduced in 1994 and have been followed since.  29 investors (plus 9 spouses and children) have been naturalised since the introduction of these guidelines.  In general, the provisions of the terms of reference have been complied with.  Details are set out in tabular form at Appendix D.</P>
    <P>Details of the various areas of industry are charted at Appendix E.</P>
    <P>On 4 September 1996 the Goverment decided that no new applications should be accepted pending the introduction of specific legislation, while processing of existing applications could continue.  On 11 March 1997 the Government decided that 19 cases on hand at 4 September 1996 were to be regarded as cases where commitments had been made while 50 other cases were to be left over until legislation was in place.</P>
    <P>On 6 May 1997, despite the decision of 11th March, the Government decided that additional applications should be accepted in respect of 3 companies.  Again, on 25 June 1997 the Government decided that a further application should be accepted in respect of a fourth company and approved the substitution of an application for investment in a particular company where the original investor had withdrawn.</P>
    <P>On 2 September, 1997 the Government decided that further consideration of the Scheme should be deferred pending a report which would be submitted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On 14 October, the Government decided that the decision taken by the previous Government on 25 June to process an application should be implemented.  The Minister approved the application and procedures were still being finalised on 10 February 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in reply to a Dáil Question that, pending the review which the Government (on 2 September, 1997) asked him to carry out, he would not be considering any of the cases which remained to be finalised.</P>
    <P>There are a small (5) number of older cases which had been approved by Ministers prior to September 1996 which have still not been completed and may never be as the applicants no longer appear to be interested.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that applications will be received from the dependants of some investors who have themselves been naturalised.  It is not possible to quantify the numbers of such applications but 8 such applications were on hand on 10 February 1998.</P>
    <P>Overall, 143 persons (48 of whom are spouses and minor children of investors) have been naturalised on foot of this Scheme, with investment in excess of £90 million having been made.  It is difficult to say precisely how many jobs have been <Col N="362" /> created, preserved but the information available suggests that the figure is in the thousands.</P>
    <P>Regulation of a scheme of this kind is very difficult for various reasons &mdash; checking character references for persons who have never lived in Ireland, checking whether the persons concerned have, in fact, honoured the undertaking to spend 60 days in Ireland in the two years after naturalisation, inability to take any effective action against persons who might not honour their commitments regarding residence.</P>
    <P>Insofar as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform could ascertain the following are countries which do give citizenship in return for investment or direct payments to Governments: St. Christopher and Nevis, Tonga, Belize and Panama.  It is understood that in 1994 the Dominican Republic, Venezuala, Ecuador, Uruguay and the Bahamas operated similar arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is of the view that the Scheme, as constituted, should not be re-established.  Failure to re-establish the Scheme would not affect the situation of any wealthy individuals who wish to live in Ireland, perhaps invest in business and apply for naturalisation under existing law.</P>
    <P>Insofar as the applications accepted for processing by the previous Government in advance of the proposed legislation are concerned, the Minister is of the view that, in the light of the legitimate expectations of those involved and in the interests of those employed in the entities concerned, these applications should be processed to finality.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister sought approval to announce the Government decision by way of a press statement and this was agreed.  The Press statement which issued is at Appendix F.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPENDIX A</P>
    <P Just="Center">Statement of Intent</P>
    <P>(In relation to the exercise by the Minister for Justice of his discretion under section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, to waive the provisions of section 15(c) of the Act in the case of persons establishing certain businesses in the State).</P>
    <P>The Minister will accept as fulfilling the requirements of &ldquo;Irish associations&rdquo; in section 16(a) the guidelines set out in (a), (b) and (c) hereunder so as to grant an application which does not comply with the condition at 15(c) of the Act, but only that condition.</P>
    <P>(a) The applicant will have acquired a residence in the State, will have been resident in the State for two years and will have spent a reasonable amount of time here over the two years.</P>
    <P>(b) The Minister will be satisfied, on the advice of a Minister of the Government, that the applicant has established a manufacturing or international services or other acceptable wealth and job creating project here that is viable and involves a substantial investment by the applicant.</P>
    <P>(c) All other requirements of the Act have been complied with.  (Copies of sections 15 and 16 of the Act are attached).</P>
    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(1) &ldquo;Residence&rdquo; for the purpose of paragraph (a) involves the establishment here of a residence consistent with the circumstances of the applicant and any of his family allowed to reside here by law and in which he (they) have their home.  The question as to whether any accommodation is or is not a &ldquo;residence&rdquo; will be decided on the criteria applicable to the grant of naturalisation generally and the decision of the Minister thereon shall be final.</P>
    <P>(2) For the purposes of &ldquo;a reasonable amount of time here over the two years&rdquo; in (a) the minimum number of days acceptable would be 60.</P>
    <P>(3) The &ldquo;project&rdquo; referred to at (b) will be one resulting from the applicant's investment and which would not otherwise have occurred.</P>
    <P>(4) The application may include a spouse and children under 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended by the Irish Nationality and Citizens Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> 4.  The following section is hereby substituted for section 15 of the Act of 1956:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;15-(1) Upon receipt of an application for a certificte of naturalisation, the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant the application, if satisfied that the applicant&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)is of full age;</P>
    <P>(b) is of good character;</P>
    <P>(c) has had a period of one year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years;</P>
    <P>(d) intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and</P>
    <P>(e) has made, either before a Justice of the District Court in open court or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.</P>

    <P>1.  To consider applications for naturalisation based on investment in the State received by the Minister for Justice and referred to the Group and to make recommendations to the Minister based on the Group's assessment of the jobcreating or job-maintenance capacity of the investment.</P>
    <P>2.  The Group will examine each application for naturalisation based on investment, with the assistance of evaluation/advice from relevant agencies where necessary and, in making their recommendations, will apply the following criteria:</P>
    <P>(a) Substantial residence must be purchased and retained <Col N="362" /> in ownership for a period of at least 5 years with an undertaking to reside in the State for a minimum of 60 days in the 2 years following naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(b) The level of investment must involve a net contribution of at least £1 million per applicant.</P>
    <P>(c) Where the investment is in the form of a loan it shall be for a duration of at least 7 years at an interest rate not greater than 1 per cent below the representative Government bond yield on the secondary market, or not greater than 1 per cent below DIBOR, whichever is lower.  The loan shall be made by the applicant direct to the firm concerned, without involvement by any intermediary.</P>
    <P>The loan arrangement shall be transparent and open to scrutiny and shall be such as to prevent the loan being factored or sold on.  The loan shall not be secured by the assets of the company in which the investment is to be made.</P>
    <P>(d) As ordinarily naturalisation would be for life, the duration of the investment should be for a significant period; at the very least 5 years.</P>
    <P>(e) The number of jobs created or maintained must be readily quantifiable and arise from the investment only.</P>
    <P>(f) Audited and certified confirmation of the investment to be available to the Group from an established auditing firm of accountants to the effect that the investment has taken place in accordance with the rules of the scheme for naturalisation.</P>
    <P>(g) The investment will be monitored by Forfás to ensure that the conditions of the investment are being maintained and, in the event that they are not, will inform the Group who, in turn, will inform the Minister for Justice with a view to revocation of citizenship.</P>
    <P>(h) Police certificate of character must be provided by authorities in country of origin (and, if required, from the Police in any country where the applicant has resided or carried on business or maintained substantial investments) together with express permission to the authorities in Ireland to enquire behind it.</P>
    <P>(i) Annual certification by an established auditing firm of accountants to Forfás that the investment is being maintained for the appropriate period.</P>

    <P Just="Center">Investment Based Naturalisation Scheme</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, John O'Donoghue, T.D., today announced the formal ending of the Investment Based Naturalisation Scheme whose operation had been suspended since the Government took office.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would now proceed to process outstanding cases that were already on hands when he was appointed.  These cases will be dealt with through the formal assessment process already in place since 1994 &mdash; which includes the involvement of an Inter-Departmental Advisory Group operating within set terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes to stress that it has always been open to would-be investors to seek in the first instance Business Permission to reside in the State.  Persons who have availed of such permission have always been in a position to apply, at a later stage, for Naturalisation under the relevant provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the long-standing arrangements in place for the granting of Business Permission to individuals to reside in Ireland and subsequent Naturalisation applications by them will be reviewed.  This review will be carried out by his Department in consultation with other Government Departments and relevant State Agencies.</P>
    <P>Pending the outcome of this review the system currently in place in respect of Business Residency Permissions and subsequent Naturalisations willcontinue to be operated by his Department.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will know, much of the accommodation occupied by gardaí up to recent years was very old, many stations having, in fact, been former RIC barracks. However, over the last number of years many new stations have been built and much refurbishment of existing stations has been undertaken.</P>
      <P>I have an ongoing building programme to deal with those Garda stations which yet remain to be replaced or refurbished.  About 30 major stations of divisional or district status remain to be tackled.  Capital funding of approximately £7 million is available through the Office of Public Works for the building programme this year and I will press for the maximum funding of the programme going forward into next year and beyond.</P>

      <P>The proposed victims commission will come within the aegis of my Department only in the sense that its staffing needs and operating expenses will be met from within the resources of the Department.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the victims commission are:</P>
      <P>(1) To conduct a review of services and arrangements in place, in this jurisdiction, to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years and to identify what further measures need to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of those in question. This would include, in particular, consideration of the following:</P>
      <P>the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement in relation to victims;</P>
      <P>the needs and concerns of persons, who have sustained serious injury, and members of the immediate families of those who have died or sustained serious injuries in the services of the State as a consequence of violent acts ensuing from the conflict;</P>
      <P>the needs and concerns of victims and the families of victims of major outrages including those of the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings.</P>
      <P>(2) To advise on how the support given to victims by their families, in helping them to cope with the immediate aftermath and continuing consequences of violence, can be acknowledged and sustained.</P>
      <P>The former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, has agreed to lead the commission.  At this juncture it is not proposed to appoint any other members to the commission.</P>
      <P>No fixed date has been set for the commission to report as I feel that this could compromise the thoroughness of the commission's consultations. However, it is envisaged that the commission should be in a position to issue its final report towards the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The preparatory process to the publication of a Government White Paper on <Col N="364" /> crime policy requires the consideration of structured, broadly-based and well-informed public discussion on crime issues.  As part of the process, I established a national crime forum earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the forum was a significant initiative and an important step in seeking the views of the public on the future direction of crime policy.  The forum held public sessions on 12 days and has met a number of times in closed session.  The report on the proceedings of the forum is, I understand, being prepared</P>
      <P>I have signalled my intention to establish a crime council as a standing forum to facilitate continuing informed public debate and consultation on the subject of crime.  I consider it right that the details of the council should be open to discussion and I have asked the national crime forum to outline what it considers to be the necessary requirements.  The initiatives as outlined above will facilitate the development of a comprehensive policy for tackling crime in a measured and balanced way.</P>

      <P>I propose take Questions Nos. 45, 48 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>When I took office last year I requested the working group on a courts commission to consider the issue of drug courts.  It recently submitted its report on the matter to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug courts have the potential to be an effective part of a pattern of projects and activities to heal the drugs problem and the social evils it creates in society.  The philosophy behind the drug courts is one of restorative rather than punitive justice in which the successful completion of the treatment programme replaces punishment. The drug court concept is most advanced in the United States where early statistics are encouraging <Col N="365" /> in terms of recidivism rates and cost effective treatment.</P>
    <P>The development of a drug court system, as recommended in the working group report, would assist the Judiciary by putting in place the infrastructure to enable the judge to order treatment and to enable that treatment be carried out. The goal of such courts would be to reduce drug use among defendants; to increase the community functioning of the participants; to reduce recidivism; to reduce social dysfunction; to reduce the overall cost to the State of the individuals involved; and to reduce the cost to the State of the prison service.</P>
    <P>The working group has recommended that a planning committee be established with a view to setting up a pilot drug courts project in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputies will agree that these proposals are without question radical and innovative. The report has been given full consideration by my Department and a memorandum for Government is being drafted and will shortly be circulated to relevant Government Departments with a view to bringing my proposals in this regard to Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The drug court system pilot project as proposed would be aimed at the less serious drug-related offences and would not deal with those of a more serious nature.  With regard to more serious drugs-related offences these are being dealt with in the Circuit, Central and Special Criminal Courts.  The additional judicial resources made available and the introduction of new criminal justice legislation in recent years have provided these courts with greater scope to address these cases.  The development of a specific court to deal with such serious offences would have to be examined in this context.</P>
    <P>The matter will also have to be considered in the context of the soon to be established courts service which under the Courts Service Act, 1998 has responsibility for management of the courts.</P>

      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the enforcement of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts is given a high priority.  In order to assist them in detecting road traffic offences, the Garda possess the most up to date equipment available.  This equipment includes hand held radar, tripod mounted lasers, radar and video cameras as well as two GATSO <Col N="366" /> units &mdash; a mobile unit equipped &mdash; with on board cameras and computer facilities.  I have also recently approved the purchase of three additional GATSO units.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have approved, in principle, the purchase of automated speed detection cameras, fixed cameras, which will be initially used in the Louth-Meath area on a pilot basis, as part of Operation Lifesaver.  The use of speed detection cameras in other police forces has increased significantly in recent years.  The experience has shown that the use of such cameras has resulted in a significant reduction in accident rates and speed.</P>

      <P>Both I and my Department were closely involved in the process of negotiation leading to the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks on Good Friday.  The contribution which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can make to the establishment of a lasting peace on the island of Ireland has accordingly been identified as a key high level goal in the Department's recently published strategy statement for the years 1998-2000.  Giving effect to those elements of the Agreement for which the Department is responsible is also identified as an important objective for that period.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Agreement, and in particular those on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity, decommissioning, security and prisoners as well as the outcome of the referendum on the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution, impose a range of significant legislative and administrative obligations on the Department. Work is already proceeding in my Department on taking forward the commitments made by the Government in the Agreement in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessary administrative arrangements, including making the necessary budgetary and personnel provision, are being put in place to enable the Department to fulfil these obligations. In addition a mechanism has been established to co-ordinate the work involved and to ensure that the targets which I have set, consistent with the terms of the Agreement, for this purpose are met. This work will be further assisted by the Department's participation in the interdepartmental steeling group of officials established by the <Col N="367" /> Government to co-ordinate the implementation of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I will also participate in the work of the institutions established by the Agreement, as will the Department, when matters which fall within the remit of the Department are under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been given a lead role in the development of a framework for child care as an equal opportunity measure. The Government recognises the need to bring about a cohesion in this area of child care and the key role other Government Departments have to play in achieving this cohesion.  Involvement of other groups and organisations such as social partners, NGOs, community groups, local authorities, health boards, area partnership boards, etc.  is essential in order to develop a comprehensive and affordable child care infrastructure.</P>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the importance of child care as an equal opportunities issue which is central to the overall social and economic development of Irish society in general.  The Government recognises that the needs and rights of children must be considered in the context of the development of a national framework and that we must ensure the best interests of children in that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, has established a national forum on early childhood education.  The work of the forum focuses on education services for children under six and on policy in early education.  This work dovetails with the work of the expert working group which was established under Partnership 2000.  This group is chaired by my Department <Col N="368" /> and charged with developing a national child care framework.  Discussions have taken place with a view to arranging inputs between the forum and the expert working group.  The expert working group on child care has a subgroup which focuses on strategies on early childhood education and has made a submission to the national education forum.</P>
    <P>Part of my remit as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to develop policies and schemes to assist parents in reconciling work and family responsibilities.  In this regard a sum of £2,615,000 is being provided by my Department for child care in 1998.  This represents an increase of over £1.7 million on the figure for 1997.  The additional moneys will build on the Government's equal opportunities child care programme as a measure to assist women and men in disadvantaged areas to avail of work, training and education opportunities.  The moneys will also assist equal opportunity child care measures in non-disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>My Department has been working in partnership with Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to deliver the programme.  ADM is an intermediary company established by the Irish Government and the European Union to support social and economic development in 38 local area based partnerships and 33 community areas throughout Ireland.  Through ADM's work with my Department, the area partnership boards have begun to advance child care as an equal opportunity measure in their areas and many of the partnerships have given &ldquo;added-value&rdquo; to the Department's child care programme.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunity child care programme will have four distinct elements: money is being targeted at community child care projects to enable them to upgrade-enhance their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need child care while they are at work or availing of training.</P>
    <P>Core funding will be used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for full-time senior child care workers in up to 25 community child care projects with a focus on equal opportunities and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The employer demonstration child care initiative is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity child care facilities. The purpose of this initiative will be to look at employer child care support from two distinct perspectives: how support for child care might alleviate difficulties associated with the growing skills shortage being experienced by some companies; and how support for child care might assist in the implementation of an overall strategy to improve and enhance equal opportunities in the workforce.</P>
    <P>The expert working group on child care was established in July 1997 to develop a national <Col N="369" /> child care framework under Partnership 2000.  It will report to the Government in December.  The members of the group are considering a range of child care issues, including the financial and employment implications of an integrated approach to the development of child care and are committed to a policy of equality of access and participation.</P>
    <P>It will also be considering the resourcing and sustaining of child care within rural and urban disadvantaged areas, while exploring practical solutions to overcoming identified barriers.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunity child care programme was designed for inclusion in the national employment action plan which Ireland submitted to the EU in Brussels in April 1998.  Following the Luxembourg Employment Summit at which equal opportunities was acknowledged as one of the four pillars of the EU, employment strategy guidelines were agreed by Heads of Government, and member states undertook to take steps to increase the level of good quality child care in order to support women's and men's entry and continued participation in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The equal opportunity child care programme will be the first of a number of supports planned by the Government to enable women and men with children to have access to training and employment opportunities.  The strategy we are developing is an initiative of major national significance in the move toward achieving equal opportunities in Ireland.  I have succeeded in getting child care included as an equal opportunity measure in the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Family has yet to be published in final form.  It will then be considered, in the first instance, by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  It would be preferable not to make any comments on the report at this stage until the final version is to hand.</P>

      <P>The national steering committee on violence against women has met on seven occasions since its establishment in December 1997.  The interdepartmental committee, which assists the steering committee in addressing the recommendations of the task force <Col N="370" /> on violence against women, has met on four occasions.</P>
      <P>Priority has been given, in the first instance, to overseeing the establishment of regional committees in each of the health board areas and this was finalised in May.  The regional committees, which consist of a wide range of groups from the public, community and voluntary sectors, will act as a focus in drawing up an assessment of existing services and needs in the region, a strategy for meeting these needs and an implementation plan, including service targets in terms of delivery and development.  The regional committees, under the direction of the national steering committee, will also oversee the development of local networks to ensure that local service providers adopt a community-based approach, including interagency co-ordination of services and sharing of information.</P>
      <P>It is intended, when the regional committees are firmly established, that there will be a public awareness campaign aimed at the prevention of violence.  Such a campaign is being developed by the national steering committee with a view to its implementation later in the year.</P>
      <P>Included within the remit of the steering committee is the publication of periodic reports.  A report on the implementation of the task force recommendations to date is being prepared for publication in the near future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 61, and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government contains a commitment to provide 1,000 additional prison places within two years.  I am pleased to confirm <Col N="371" /> that work on the provision of these places is well advanced and that the commitment will be met.</P>
    <P>The new 152 place Castlerea place of detention was taken over by my Department in May and prisoners are being transferred there on a phased basis from the other institutions.  A new 60 place block at Limerick Prison, which was completed earlier this year, is now in operation.</P>
    <P>The construction of a new remand prison at Cloverhill adjacent to the existing place of detention at Wheatfield is due to be completed by the end of this year and an additional 400 places will become available at that time.</P>
    <P>The new female prison at Mountjoy, which will hold 80 prisoners, will be completed by the end of this year.  Work has also commenced on the construction of a new 400 place prison at Portlaoise. This prison will be completed in August 1999 and will also include a special 40 place unit intended for the management of disruptive and other difficult categories of prisoners.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above programme of works, preliminary planning for examining a number of options aimed at providing further additional prison accommodation has been commenced in my Department.</P>
    <P>The extensive programme of works outlined above, which amounts to a total of 1,092 additional prison places, demonstrates my commitment to eliminating the acute shortage of prison accommodation which has been a major problem for some time now.  The commitment included in the programme for Government will be, exceeded, as shown in the programme which I have outlined above.</P>

In relation to drug dealing offences, I inform the Deputy that these are generally dealt with in the Circuit Court.  In this regard I am informed that where cases are ready to proceed they are given hearing dates within three months of the date of arraignment.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which is currently before the House, contains provisions which abolish the preliminary examination procedure in the District Court.  In so far as this procedure contributes to delays in bringing cases to trial it should help to speed up trials and reduce such delays.</P>

      <P>A Bill to amend the law relating to criminal insanity is at present being drafted in the parliamentary draftsman's office. The Bill is a complex one and I expect to be in a position to publish it in the next session.</P>
      <P>The Bill will contain extensive provisions dealing with witness to plead at a criminal trial, a definition of criminal insanity and provide for a new verdict of &ldquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&rdquo; to replace the present &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; verdict; and introduce a new plea of &ldquo;guilty but with diminished responsibility&rdquo; in cases of murder.  In addition, it will establish a new review body whose function it will be to review the cases of persons detained after verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity or findings of unfitness to plead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position in relation to this matter.  As the Deputy is aware, this arrangement arose from an approach made to the Garda authorities by Esat Digifone with a proposal to co-locate mobile telephony equipment <Col N="375" /> on Garda radio masts or sites in the context of their planned mobile telephone network.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the desire to avoid a proliferation of such masts, as recommended in the Guidelines for Local Planning Authorities on the siting of Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures, which were issued by the Department of the Environment in July 1996, the previous Government approved the proposal, subject to Esat Digifone complying fully with planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines which may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.  Following Government approval of the proposal a contract was concluded with Esat Digifone in early 1997 under which it is permitted to use up to 418 of a total 704 Garda station sites, that is, approximately 59 per cent of all Garda stations.  The Garda station at Maam is among the 418 sites identified by Esat Digifone as being of interest to it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that careful and detailed consideration was given to the Esat Digifone proposal and that the agreement with it is designed to ensure full protection to the public and the environment.  Should any doubt arise in this regard it would be a matter for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and the relevant planning authorities to consider.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the contract concluded with Esat Digifone, I am not at liberty to refuse it access to Garda sites, except for a contravention by the company of any of the conditions associated with such access which I outlined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's records indicate that three claims have been settled in respect of personal injuries sustained in very exceptional circumstances by persons arising from assaults on them by offenders on temporary release or unlawfully at large.  These incidents occurred in 1986, 1990 and 1992.  The total amount of settlement payments was £73,000 plus legal costs of £30,000 approximately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the granting of temporary release is a statutory function of the Minister for Justice under the Criminal Justice <Col N="376" /> Act, 1960.  Temporary release may be granted for various reasons to prisoners serving sentences of imprisonment and is an essential part of the rehabilitation process.  Each case is individually assessed on the basis of the views of the governor of the institution in which the offender is imprisoned, the Garda Síochána and, if relevant, any recommendations of the sentence review group, taking into consideration such matters as: Would a release constitute a threat to the community?  Is it reasonable to grant temporary release at this particular stage, in view of the nature of the crime committed?  Does the offender merit temporary release having regard to behaviour while in prison? Are there any compassionate grounds which merit special consideration?</P>
    <P>Where temporary release is granted it is always subject to conditions.  In all cases, there is the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour.  Various other conditions may be applied, for example, the individual concerned may be subject to supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service, he or she may be required to report at regular intervals to a Garda station or to reside at a particular location and so on.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that there is some risk involved in every case where a prisoner is released and if compensation were to become payable by the State in every case where a prisoner commits a further offence while on temporary release then this would have serious repercussions for the temporary release process and ultimately for the rehabilitative process which it is meant to serve.</P>

      <P>A range of projects and initiatives was undertaken as part of the programme of the co-ordinating committee for European Year Against Racism, 1997, which was set up under the aegis of my Department, and to which £100,000 was allocated by my Department.</P>
      <P>The co-ordinating committee was representative of Departments, State agencies, trade unions and non-governmental organisations working in the area of racism.  It undertook a range of actions and projects aimed at addressing racism in the areas of education, gender, the media, sport, refugees and asylum seekers, travellers and the workplace. It also progressed its work through Government initiatives relating to the delivery of customer action plans, the national anti-poverty strategy, development aid and development education. The Ireland Report for European Year Against Racism, which I launched on 27 April, is available at the Government Publications Sales Office.  It sets out details of the various initiatives and includes examples of projects funded by the committee.  The co-ordinating committee has now finished its work.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the momentum of European Year Against Racism continues I have set up a national consultative committee on racism and interculturalism, whose job will be to advise the Government on matters relating to racism and to reinforce and develop initiatives commenced during 1997.  The new committee is developing a comprehensive programme to address the problem of racism in all its forms and to promote interculturalism.  It will hold its first meeting early next month.</P>

      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Abolition Bill passed Second Stage in the Dáil on 19 March 1997.</P>
      <P>The detail of the Bill is being examined in my Department at present, particularly from the point of view of the constitutionality and practicality of its proposals, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Registrar of Titles.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to indicate yet when that examination will be completed but any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that pending the completion of that examination I could not comment in detail on the particular constitutional issues in question other than to make the general point that successive Governments have accepted that the abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation arrangements would not be in accordance with constitutional requirements.</P>

      <P>The following research projects have been, or are in the process of being commissioned by my Department.  The awarding of any contract to carry out a research project is, of course, dependent on suitable tenders being received in my Department: a review of coroner law; evaluation and development of equality proofing arrangements in the context of the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS); collation, evaluation and analysis of survey of equal opportunities in the semi-State sector; study of male/female wage differentials; provision, as part of Department's website, of Internet links to externally generated information relevant to the Department's mandate; comparative study between Irish immigration and asylum legislation and that of our EU partners; study on the effect of the introduction of the Bail Act, 1997; examination of the reporting of sexual offences; evaluation and assessment of impact of Garda special project in areas of acute social disadvantage; level of HV/Hepatitis infection among prison population; level of learning disability among prison population; general healthcare study of prison <Col N="383" /> population; preparatory work related to a draft EU Convention on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations; evaluation of the operation of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983; and North/South study on attitudes to treatment of offenders in the community.</P>
      <P>In addition to these projects, a number of further research studies are also under consideration at present.  Furthermore, while the project listed above will be funded by my Department, a small number of externally developed research projects which have a relevance to the mandate of the Department ar in receipt of part-funding from the research budget.  These include a study by the Health Research Board into provision of creche facilities for mothers who are receiving treatment for drug addiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Garda authorities that there is no specific information available regarding the use of rohypnol in crimes and that rohypnol, which is listed as a controlled drug, under the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977-84, is used by drug abusers to &ldquo;come down&rdquo; from the effects of the abused drug.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that rohypnol is frequently prescribed to patients as a sleep-inducer, however, it now appears that it may be procured illegally.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Department of Health and Children that in response to various reports of misuse, this drug was reclassified in 1993 and as a result, unauthorised possession became an offence, thus making it more difficult for drug misusers to gain access to it.  Doctors prescribing rohypnol must comply with the special prescription writing requirements as set out in the Misuse of Drugs Regulations, 1988.  Furthermore, persons, such as doctors and pharmacists, having the drug in their lawful possession must keep it in safe custody in accordance with requirements of the Misuse of Drugs (Safe Custody) Regulations, 1982.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in the course of my reply to questions on 14 May 1998, the Government made a commitment in the British-Irish Agreement to establish a human rights commission whose mandate and remit will extend to keeping the adequacy and effectiveness of laws and practices under review, making recommendations to Government as necessary, providing information and promoting awareness of human rights, considering draft legislation as required, and, in appropriate cases, bringing court proceedings or providing assistance to individuals doing so.</P>
      <P>Work on the establishment of a human rights commission is now being taken forward by my Department.  This will involve extensive contact and co-operation with the relevant agencies in the neighbouring jurisdictions in view of the commitments both Governments have entered into to make comparable changes in this area.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the number of gardaí who reported sick on Saturday, 13 June 1998 was 3,549.  This figure represents 84 per cent of the 4,225 gardaí rostered for duty on that day.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Garda pay dispute, the position is that the Garda Representative Association has re-entered the discussions on pay under the chairmanship of Mr. Declan Brennan.  I am hopeful that a settlement in accordance with Government pay policy can be agreed by both parties without any undue delay.</P>

      <P>The UN Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for People with disabilities offers an instrument of policy-making and action to people with disabilities and their representative organisations.  These rules, though not in themselves compulsory, imply a strong moral and political commitment on behalf of States to take action for the equalisation of opportunities.</P>
      <P>The Government's legislative commitment to people with disabilities in the employment area is set out in the Employment Equality Act, 1998.  In the non-employment area the Government proposes to publish an Equal Status Bill before the end of 1998 which will deal with disability in areas other than employment.</P>

      <P>The Judicial Training Institute established by the Chief Justice in late 1996 is responsible for the training and development of all Judges.  The board of the institute is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes the Presidents of the High, Circuit and District Courts and a judge of each of these courts.  Since its establishment the institute have held a number of seminars and conferences dealing with a diversity of matters including family law, drug related matters and sentencing.  In a forthcoming conference it is proposed to address the issue of DNA evidence in paternity testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware the Constitution <Col N="386" /> provides that all judges shall be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions subject only to the Constitution and the law.  The constitutional independence of the Judiciary excludes any action by myself as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform which could be interpreted as direct interference in the exercise of their judicial functions including the imposition of a training or briefing programme on them.  Initiatives with regard to the training of the Judiciary, therefore, are a matter entirely for the courts.  I have however always assisted with initiatives which the Judiciary have brought forward with regard to training and funds have always been made available to judges at all levels to enable them to attend training seminars and conferences both at home and abroad.  The importance of judicial training was recognised in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995 which contains provisions which empower me to provide funding for judicial training and which require persons wishing to be considered for judicial appointment to agree to undergo training if appointed.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the developments in judicial training in recent years and will continue to support such initiatives.</P>

      <P>Provision is already made in legislation for certain evidence to be given in cases without the necessity for the person tendering that evidence to appear in court.  Under section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997 a member of the Garda Síochána may give evidence of certain matters, such as that relating to guarding the scene of a crime, by way of certificate.  Section 11 of that Act also provides for the provision of a certificate as evidence of fingerprints and palmprints.</P>
      <P>I regard it as very important to reduce as much as possible the time gardaí must spend in court in relation to the giving of evidence orally which could be dealt with in a different way.  It is in that context that I have included in the Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which is currently before the House, a provision providing that in any criminal proceedings a certificate signed by a garda stating that he or she had custody of an exhibit at a specified place for a specified time will be admissible as evidence of that fact.  Provisions of this kind are clearly desirable and I am keeping the matter under continuous review.</P>

      <P>The Commission on the Family was set up by the Minister for Social Welfare in October 1995 to make recommendations to the Government on proposals which would strengthen the capacity of families to carry out their functions in a changing economic and social environment.  On 15 May 1998 Deputy Dermot Ahern, Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, launched the main findings of the report.  I will examine the recommendations appropriate to my Department, which include recommendations in relation to child care provision and access to speedy and effective resolution procedures for families who have recourse to family law, when the final report is published.</P>

    <P>The above statistics reflect the fact that the personnel strength of the force in Galway city has improved considerably in recent years and the planned allocation of this additional personnel, as already outlined, will improve the situation even more.  The Garda authorities have also assured me that the Garda personnel situation in Galway city will continue to be monitored and reviewed. They have further informed me that each time additional personnel become available for allocation the needs of the Galway division will be fully considered in conjunction with the needs of other divisions throughout the country.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform funds a number of community based projects in which the Garda Síochána are involved.  There are 14 such projects which are aimed primarily at diverting juveniles from possible involvement in crime.</P>
      <P>Special projects are established in communities where a specific need has been identified.  The initiative generally comes from the ground up, usually from the Garda Síochána or from a statutory or voluntary agency working in the community, or from residents themselves.  While the projects do not all conform to the same structure, as they are &ldquo;tailor made&rdquo; to address the specific needs and problems in each area, they do have the same common theme running through them.</P>

      <P>The elimination of the practice known as &ldquo;slopping out&rdquo; is a priority issue in the ongoing prisons building and refurbishment programme.  The provision of in-cell sanitation is now accepted policy in all new prison accommodation. In addition, major progress has been made in the extension of integral sanitation to all existing prison accommodation.  In recent years Arbour Hill Prison, St Patrick's Institution, Fort Mitchel, the Curragh prison and parts of Mountjoy prison have all been upgraded.  It is intended to continue to afford this work the highest priority and to complete the programme as soon as possible subject to operational requirements. The availability of a significant number of new prison spaces which will be coming on stream over the next 18 months or so arising from the current prisons building programme will facilitate the acceleration of the refurbishment programme including the provision of integral sanitation in all of the prisons where this has not been achieved to date.</P>

      <P>Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, where a person is convicted on indictment, the court can determine whether the offender has benefited from the offence and can make an order confiscating money to the value of any such benefit.  This process can at present only <Col N="393" /> be initiated on the application of the DPP.  The Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1997, which is currently before the House, changes this by providing that on conviction for a drug trafficking offence the court will automatically determine whether the offender has benefited from that offence with a view to making a confiscation order.  This determination will be made unless the court is satisfied that the amount which might be recovered would not be sufficient to justify the making of a determination.</P>

      <P>The applicant declared 90.12 hectares on his 1997 area aid application form.  Part of this land has not yet been digitised to date.  In an effort to identify the location and the area of this land, maps have been sent to the person concerned, who should clarify the position as a matter of urgency.  No further payments in respect of 1997 special beef premium can issue to the person named until the digitising of the land claimed is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme. In effect the regulations require that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1996 EU special beef premium scheme are made a comparison is to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the <Col N="398" /> number qualifying under the 1996 schemes. Money is to be recouped from those farmers who, had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department has been in the process of recovering overpayments from those farmers in the former category and this money is to be used to make outstanding payments to farmers in the latter category.  The person named had 12 more eligible animals under the 1996 special beef premium scheme and one additional suckler cow under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme.  He will, therefore, be entitled to further top-up payments on these animals.  The vast majority of moneys overpaid are now recovered consequently, it is expected that payment of amounts due will commence before the end of July.</P>
    <P>As the 1997 BSE top-up of his 1996 special beef premium was paid in advance of the final payment of 1996 special beef premium an underpayment occurred in respect of 15 animals' also arising from this was a recoupment of £57.24 from the 1997 BSE top-up of 1996 suckler cow premium. A top-up payment on these 15 animals' amounting to £150.00, £10.00 x 15, has been prepared for issue along with a refund of the £57.24 recouped in error.</P>

      <P>Individuals whose incomes do not exceed £207 per week for employees and £10,750 per annum for the self-employed are not liable to the employment and training levy and the health contribution. Incomes exceeding those thresholds, which include the increases announced in the 1998 budget, are subject to both levies in full.  The cost to the Exchequer of maintaining the exemption thresholds at their current levels, estimated by reference to the budget forecasts for 1998, are estimated at £34 million for the employment and training levy, and £42 million for the health contribution.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated cost to the Exchequer in 1998 as a result of the fact that the standard rate of corporation tax is 32 per cent and the reduced rate on the first £50,000 is 25 per cent when the estimated revenue resulting from these changes is compared with the revenue that would accrue if the rate of corporation tax was 50 per cent excluding the effect of the abolition of tax credits.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to provide a realistic estimate of the net corporation tax revenue that would accrue with a standard rate of 50 per cent.  I have no doubt that if the rate was increased to 50 per cent this would have the effect of hugely slowing down business investment and confidence thereby reducing overall profit levels and tax revenues.</P>
      <P>Each 1 per cent change in the standard rate of corporation tax of 32 per cent is estimated to alter tax revenue by about £24 million.  It is not reasonable, however, simply to factor this up by an appropriate multiplier to determine what an increase in the corporation tax rate to 50 per cent would yield.</P>
      <P>In 1987, when the standard rate of corporation tax was 50 per cent, there were many reliefs available such as accelerated capital allowances.  As the rates have been reduced, many of these reliefs have been curtailed and the base broadened.  This factor, combined with a growing economy has increased the yield from £255.7 million in 1987 to £1697.1 million in 1997, even though the rates have been reduced.</P>

      <P>A child's birth certificate has to be produced to the Adoption Board as one of the formal proofs required before an adoption order is made.  When the board receives the birth mother's consent to an adoption the details are cross referenced with the details on the child's birth certificate.  If the two pieces of information are not identical the matter would be investigated by the Adoption Board.</P>
      <P>The authorised person procedure referred to in my previous reply was introduced following a High Court decision in the M. and M. v An Bord Uchtala, referred to as the McL case.  The ensuing Adoption Act, 1976, empowered the Adoption Board to use authorised persons for the purpose of interviewing birth mothers.</P>

      <P>While the organisation referred to by the Deputy may have a Dublin address and telephone number I understand from inquiries made by the Department of Foreign Affairs that the organisation is American in origin. As I explained in response to Parliamentary Question No. 99 of 17 June 1998, the Adoption Board has no regulatory powers at present in regard to foreign adoption agencies operating in Ireland and offering services in regard to inter-country adoption.  The Adoption Act, 1991, does not provide for regulation of such agencies.  This issue will be addressed in the legislation to ratify the Hague Convention.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House last week my officials are at an early stage in the preparation of the legislation to enable the State to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of inter-country adoption.</P>
      <P>The convention sets out a framework for regulation and co-operation in regard to inter-country adoption.  Article 1 of the convention lists its objects as the establishment of safeguards and of a system of co-operation and the securing of recognition in contracting states of adoptions made in accordance with the convention.  Under the convention itself, the rules and procedures will only apply to Contracting States.</P>
      <P>No decisions have yet been taken in regard to whether or not provisions of the promised legislation will apply to non-contracting states of origin. I intend to take the opportunity presented by the new legislation to address many of the issues in the field of inter-country adoption which have arisen since the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1991, and to put in place a regulated system of inter-country adoption which operates in the best interests of children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>As I have stated to the House last week there is a clear need for legislation in order to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption contact system.  However, I did not think it prudent to proceed in this regard prior to the clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records, heard by the Supreme Court in July of last year.</P>
      <P>The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the very heart of post adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of his or her birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case on 13 March last and the way is now clear to legislate in the area.  However, before putting forward any proposals in this matter it is necessary for my Department to consider the judgment of the Supreme Court with great care and to consult with the various interests involved and with people with expertise in the field.  It must be remembered that what is at issue is not only the rights of persons adopted under the Adoption Acts and their birth parents; but also the rights of persons separated from their birth parents in other circumstances including persons informally adopted prior to the enactment of the Adoption Acts, 1952.  Indeed, it was to persons in this category that the Supreme Court case to which I have referred related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely complex and difficult area of human relationships and it is essential to strike the right balance between the wishes of all concerned.  I have not yet made any decisions as to how I will proceed in this area <Col N="404" /> but I will be listening carefully to all views before finalising my proposals so that this issue can be dealt with in a coherent, integrated and sensitive manner.  Decisions regarding the specifics of what post-adoption services will be provided, including such issues as counselling and the manner in which information may be released or withheld will have to await decisions on the overall legislative framework within which they will operate.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the difficulties being experienced by those seeking to make contact with birth parents or with adult adoptees.  The legislative framework which will be put in place in due course will provide for a comprehensive post-adoption service and as stated last week the extremely complex and difficult work involved in bringing forward the overall legislative framework will be afforded a high priority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The information sought by the Deputy is outlined below.  The employee PRSI free allowance was increased from £80 to £100 per week in the 1998 budget.  This increase took effect from 6 April 1998.  The social insurance fund (SIF) <Col N="407" /> income foregone as a result of the £20 per week increase is estimated at £22.5 million in 1998 and £37.5 million in a full year.  The overall SIF income foregone as a result of the £100 employee</P>
    <P>PRSI free allowance, in the 1998-9 contribution year is estimated at £220 million for class A employees.  The employee rate of PRSI was reduced from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent with effect from 6 April 1997.  The estimated SIF income foregone in the 1998-9 PRSI contribution year, as a result of the 1 per cent reduction is £81 million.  The estimated SIF income foregone as a result of applying a 12 per cent higher rate of employer PRSI in 1998-9, as distinct from a 12.33 per cent rate is £28 million.  The employer lower rate of 8.5 per cent applies since 6 April 1998 in the case of all employments where weekly earnings are £270 per week or less.  The estimated SIF income foregone as a result of applying an 8.5 per cent employer lower rate in the 1998-9 contribution year, as distinct from a rate of 12 per cent on all employments, is £165 million.  The estimated SIF income foregone in the 1998-9 contribution year as a result of the £20 PRSI free allowance which applies to modified PRSI contributors is £1.8 million.  The PRSI annual earnings ceiling for all employees is £24,200, effective since 6 April 1998.  The estimated reduction in SIF income, in contribution year 1998-9, which would arise if the employee PRSI annual ceiling were reduced to £19,450 is £40 million.  The estimated reduction in SIF income in contribution year 1998-9, which would arise if the employer PRSI annual ceiling were reduced from £29,000 to £19,450, is £165 million.</P>

      <P>Pay related benefit (PRB) was phased out as basic rates of payments were improved.  PRB was discontinued for all insured workers in relation to new claims for disability benefit and injury benefits, where applicable, made after 6 April 1992.  PRB was discontinued for all insured workers in relation to new claims for unemployment benefit made after 21 July 1994.  PRB continued to be payable with claims which were already in payment on the dates in question.</P>
      <P>Prior to its phasing out, the criteria for calculating PRB varied over the years so there is no reliable basis for calculating PRB in 1998 if the scheme were still in existence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 155, 156 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is outlined below.</P>
      <P>The estimated yield in 1998 of PRSI payable by the self-employed (PRSI class S) is £125 million.</P>
      <P>The estimated social insurance fund income foregone as a result of the £20 per week PRSI free allowance which applies to class S contributors is £1.8 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that, if the rate of class S PRSI was 7 per cent as distinct from 5 per cent, the extra yield would be £50 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of a specific recommendation by an independent actuary that the appropriate rate for the self-employed should be 7 per cent. However, the National Pensions Board in its final report in 1993 recommended that the appropriate rate for self-employed contributors should be 7.6 per cent, with a minority recommending lower rates.  Any change in the current rate can only be considered in the context of overall budgetary policy and the economic climate generally.</P>

      <P>Regulations were introduced in July 1992 which provided for, among other things, the assessment of a claimant's income from insurable part-time employment for the purpose of determining entitlement to unemployment assistance.  It was estimated that this measure would give rise to savings of some £750,000 in 1992.</P>
      <P>It should be noted however that, subsequently, further regulations were introduced which provided for income disregards which aimed to ensure that claimants with relatively low levels of income from insurable part-time employment would be entitled to receive a higher rate of unemployment assistance.  Furthermore, the manner of assessing entitlement to unemployment assistance in the case of part-time casual workers was fundamentally revised with effect from November 1996 in order to improve the incentive to work and to simplify the system.</P>

      <P>The revised arrangements for the assessment of earnings from employment for unemployment assistance purposes, which came into effect in November 1996, provide that an unemployed person who works up to three days a week, may, subject to the level of his or her earnings, qualify for the full rate of UA for that week, including payment in respect of the days in the week on which the person worked.  The improved arrangements provide that earnings are assessed at 60 per cent.  In addition, persons without children are allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings are assessed at 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous arrangements, which have now been replaced, provided that payment was only made in respect of the days in the week on which the person was unemployed, less one sixth of their weekly means for each day of unemployment. Claimants were allowed to earn up to £15 above the appropriate daily rate of UA before being assessed with means.  However, no payment <Col N="410" /> was made in respect of days of employment, irrespective of the level of daily earnings.</P>
    <P>The revised arrangements serve two purposes. First, they ensure that claimants have an incentive to work for up to three days a week at any levels of earnings, even where the level of pay is less than the rate of UA.  Second, the new arrangements are clearer and easier to understand and thus enable people to see for themselves the extent to which they will be better off when they take up part-time or casual employment as opposed to claiming UA.</P>
    <P>When the revised arrangements were introduced, it was envisaged that some 10,500 casual workers would benefit financially &mdash; the impact on net income varying according to family size, number of days worked and level of earnings. The total cost to the Exchequer is estimated at £1.6 million in a full year.  Provision was also made to guarantee the existing entitlements of recipients, so as to ensure that no one would be worse off arising from the new arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated saving to his Department in 1998 as a result of the fact that the child dependant allowance for social welfare recipients did not rise in line with the personal payment since 1995.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that it would cost in the region of £43 million, in a full year, to increase child dependant allowances in line with increases in personal payment rates from 1995 to date.</P>
      <P>The strategy of successive Governments for reforming income support for children has been to reduce work disincentives by making child income support more neutral <i>vis-a -vis</i> the employment status of the parent.  Substantial resources have therefore been dedicated to increasing child benefit rates over the past four years and I continued this policy in budget 1998. In total, the increases in child benefit over this period cost £164.93 million.</P>
      <P>The budget provided for an increase of £1.50 per month in the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first two children and a £3 increase per month in the higher rate, payable in respect of third and subsequent children.  These increases, ranging from 5 per cent to 7.7 per cent, are well ahead of expected price increases.  These increases cost approximately £24 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority has also been given to utilising family income supplement as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  From the beginning of June, the income thresholds which determine a family's <Col N="411" /> entitlement to FIS were increased by £7 at each point.  Furthermore the budget also provided for, with effect from October next, the assessment of FIS on a full net basis i.e., net of PRSI, tax and superannuation contributions.  These changes will cost approximately £10 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The real improvements which were introduced in the budget demonstrate my clear commitment towards providing genuine support for families, whether in or out of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that, if the allowance payable in respect of qualified adults had been increased in line with increases in the personal rates of payment over the years 1995 to date, the additional cost would be £7.2 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The allowance payable in respect of a qualified adult has been increased each year from 1995 to date.  The 1998 budget provided for a general increase of £3 per week in all social welfare payments as well as an overall increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments to all persons over the age of 66.  The rate of payment of allowances in respect of all qualified adults was increased by 3 per cent.  These increases in weekly rates of payment cost over £180 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) argued that two people living together, especially couples, are financially interdependent as all of the main living costs such as housing, fuel and household goods are shared and there are economies of scale involved.  In this regard, the commission recommended that the rates of payment for qualified adults should be set at 60 per cent of the basic payment for a single person.</P>
      <P>The CSW's approach in relation to the payment rates for qualified adults has, in general, been adopted by successive Governments and it is also the one which I have followed in this year's budget.  The increased qualified adult allowance rates, which have been paid from the beginning of June, will range from 56 per cent to 69 per cent of the respective personal rates, with the majority of rates at 58.4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emphasis in relation to rates increases in recent years has been to concentrate resources on moving towards the minimum personal rate recommended by the CSW.  The increases provided in this year's budget will mean that the personal rates of payment for 94 per cent of social <Col N="412" /> welfare recipients are now above the CSW recommended rates.</P>
    <P>However, the appropriateness of the 1.6 equivalence scale, as recommended by the CSW, has been questioned by a number of commentators. The expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems, in examining this issue, recommended that further research should be carried out on this matter.</P>
    <P>In this regard, the interdepartmental working group, which is currently examining the treatment of one and two-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes, is looking at the existence of the concept of qualified adult in the social welfare payment system, with particular reference to individualisation of payments.  One of the group's specific terms of reference is to carry out research on equivalence scales.</P>
    <P>The working group will be reporting to me later in the year and I expect that its report will be of considerable assistance in formulating future policy in this area.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply to Questions Nos. 10, 64, 77, 80 and 93 on 14 May 1998 on the subject of missing persons.</P>
      <P>The question of establishing a missing persons unit and the question of taking any additional operational measures to investigate such cases, is kept under review by the Garda Commissioner.  I welcome the recent changes in the procedures for dealing with missing persons cases which the Commissioner has introduced and the renewed emphasis placed on the role of Garda liaison officers in these cases.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that new guidelines have also been introduced by the Garda to assist and involve the reportee or family of the missing person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the issue of international co-operation in such investigations, a number of information systems exist within the various European Union countries for reporting and identifying missing persons.  Input into these information systems at national level assists in securing international co-operation in locating missing persons. A joint action concerning trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children was adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 24 February 1997.  In the framework of the implementation of that joint action, the Council on 19 March 1998 approved a number of <Col N="413" /> measures aimed at increasing police co-operation in locating missing persons.</P>

      <P>As per An Action Programme for the Millennium, the Government is fully committed to ensuring that the needs of victims are central to dealing with the issue of crime.</P>
      <P>On the question of compensation for victims, a scheme already exists for the compensation of victims of crime.  Exchequer funds are voted annually for the purpose and they are administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. In 1997 the tribunal paid out almost £4 million in compensation to the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that it has long been the practice that court fines are channelled into the Exchequer or in certain circumstances the appropriate Department or office depending on the offence for which the fine was imposed, e.g. fines imposed for fishing offences are transferred to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and fines for revenue offences are transferred to the Revenue Commissioners.  I have no proposals at present to redirect this funding.</P>

For example, sentences of penal servitude and imprisonment with hard labour have already been abolished and replaced with sentences of imprisonment as recommended by the commission.  Other recommendations remain under consideration in my Department and any proposals which emerge will be announced in the usual way.  I should point out, however, that the report specifically recommends against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.  It is also the case that the report pointed up a number of differences of opinion among the members of the commission in relation to some of the recommendations in that report, which tends to underline the obvious complexities which arise in relation to sentencing policy.</P>

      <P>The Employment Equality Act, 1998, when brought into force, will outlaw age discrimination in recruitment between the ages of 18 and 65, subject to certain limited exceptions.  These exceptions allow age limits to be set:</P>
      <P>where there is clear actuarial or other evidence that significantly increased costs would arise if the age limits were not imposed;</P>
      <P>to take account of any cost or period of time involved in training a recruit to a standard at which the recruit will be effective in the job; or</P>
      <P>to take account of the need for there to be a reasonable period of time prior to retirement age during which the recruit will be effective in that job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from my colleague the Minister for Finance that recruitment policy in respect of the <Col N="416" /> Civil Service has been aligned with the terms of the Act.  All recruitment to general service grades in the Civil Service will now proceed without upper age limits (apart from 65 years).  However the Act's exceptional provisions may have some relevance to the professional and departmental streams within the Civil Service, and I understand that the Department of Finance is currently consulting with line Departments so as to identify any Departmental or professional recruitment grades in which an upper age limit would be necessary in accordance with the Act.</P>
    <P>As far as local authorities and health boards are concerned, at present age limits are a normal feature of recruitment.  I understand from my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the question of age limits is being reviewed at the moment in the context of the Act.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children has informed me that his Department will be making any necessary changes to current practice in health board recruitment in light of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Illegal migration is a growing phenomenon in the modern world.  It is of course a clandestine and covert activity.  It is intentionally recognised that criminal elements are extensively involved in trafficking in illegal immigrants. Inevitably therefore it is the case that many illegal entrants to the State evade early detection.  As such it is difficult to provide a reliable estimate of the scale of illegal entry to the State.</P>
      <P>Some indicators of the level at which illegal entry is taking place are, however, available.  Up to 19 June a total of 971 persons failed to meet the criteria for entry to the State and were refused leave to land.  This figure includes those persons detected attempting to enter illegally, but it also includes persons whose primary intention was not to enter illegally.</P>
      <P>In addition, so far this year a total of 2,535 persons sought asylum in the State and a very significant proportion of those persons entered in breach of aliens' regulations.  I should make very clear, however, that entering the State illegally does not affect the substantive examination of an asylum claim.</P>
      <P>These figures do not capture those who enter the State illegally for other purposes, including to work without a work permit or those who enter legally but remain beyond the permission granted to them.</P>

      <P>Prior to March 1996 asylum duties were carried out by two officials within my immigration division.  By December 1996 there <Col N="418" /> were four and a half staff assigned full time to asylum duties.  In the same month, the Department of Finance agreed, as an interim measure, to sanction additional staff for the asylum area. By April 1997, the number of staff dedicated to dealing with asylum applications had risen to 13.</P>
      <P>On 28 July 1997 the Government approved, as an interim measure, the recruitment of 72 temporary staff.  On conclusion of industrial relations negotiations over the recruitment of retired public servants, the Department of Finance approved the 72 posts on 27 February 1998.  To date, 66 of the 72 extra staff posts, including 25 retired public servants recruited as part-time contractors who represent 15 full-time posts, are now in place. These new staff are exclusively involved in the processing of individual applications for refugee status; including the reception arrangements, scheduling and conducting interviews, assessments, decision-making, application of the Dublin Convention, processing of appeals, etc.  All staff have completed appropriate training courses and have received &ldquo;on-the-job&rdquo; experience of interviews and assessments.  The training programmes were agreed with UNHCR and delivered by a combination of my Department's own experienced personnel, UNHCR training specialists and the UNHCR's full-time official here.</P>
      <P>On 5 May 1998, most of the newly trained staff took up their assignments processing applications for refugee status.  That date can therefore be regarded as the starting point from which we have begun to fully address the backlog.  It is intended to process both current and outstanding cases simultaneously to deal with cases as they arrive and to address the outstanding caseload within a reasonable period of time.</P>
      <P>The lack of adequate numbers of trained staff to process applications for refugee status obviously contributed to the growth of the backlog of such applications.  However, Deputies who may have concerns with regard to individual applications should be assured that all cases outstanding will be processed within a reasonable period and in full accordance with the procedures approved by the UNHCR.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 186 together.</P>
      <P>The lasting effects of any Government's crime policies have to be assessed over the long term rather than the short term.  In the short term, however, the signs are promising, as evidenced by the trend emerging from the Garda Síochána crime statistics which show that indictable offences in 1997 were down by approximately 10 per cent when compared to 1996.</P>
      <P>I have outlined before in the House what is involved in the concept of zero tolerance.  There are three essential components to the Government's zero tolerance approach to crime, clear and determined focus on tackling those who are engaged in crime, a determination that the law enforcement agencies will be properly equipped and resourced to deal with crime, and a commitment to address, and where possible to ameliorate, the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>As regards the targeting of particular criminal activity, the Deputy will be aware of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1997 which is before the House.  This is clear, practical evidence of the Government's policy of zero tolerance towards crime &mdash; particularly, but not exclusively, towards drug trafficking. The Bill contains a series of very strong measures which are, regrettably, all too necessary as a response to those who inflict such harm on our community.</P>
      <P>An aggressive policy is being pursued by the Garda Síochána in obtaining evidence to bring drug traffickers before the courts.  This has led to significant seizures of illegal drugs, the disruption of organised networks and the charging of major players.</P>
      <P>I am also conscious that any long-term anticrime policy must engage local communities in co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  To elicit the views of the public, I established a National Crime Forum which held public sessions in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Sligo.  This has given a unique opportunity to the general public to contribute openly to the debate on the wide range of issues which impact on crime and I look forward to receiving the report of the forum in due course Later in the year I intend to establish a permanent community-based crime council to continue this open approach to crime policy development and I will also publish a White Paper to address the priority issues.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Courts Services Act, 1998 was signed into law on 16 April 1998, thus establishing an independent Courts Service.  I am pursuing a similar course, in the case of prisons, and a fundamental review of the Probation and Welfare Service is also under way. The process of implementing the recommendations of an SMI review of the Garda Síochána has also started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year has also seen the introduction of a <Col N="420" /> witness security programme in the area of serious organised crime, most notably in the drugs and money laundering areas.  The programme ensures that the criminal justice system can take prosecutions in cases which, by their very nature, attract the most serious and hardened of criminals.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware also that the most extensive prisons building programme ever undertaken in the history of the State is under way and that there is also a firm commitment to raise the strength of the Garda to 12,000 within the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The approach being taken, therefore, is a wide ranging and cohesive one which seeks to tackle various categories of criminals and to address the underlying causes of crime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180, 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to provide the precise information sought by the Deputy in the time available. However, the daily average number of persons on temporary release over the past 12 months was approximately 516.  In 1994, the latest year for which accurate figures are available, 3,733 individuals were granted full temporary, or early, release and 217 were discharged from custody on a renewable temporary release scheme.  Exact figures for later years are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The granting of temporary or early release &mdash; called parole in other jurisdictions &mdash; is a feature of prison systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  The positive and negative reasons for the system have been well debated in this House before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that some early releases arise due to prison overcrowding.  This has been the <Col N="421" /> case for several years.  However, it would be wrong to suggest that serious offenders are being released simply because of accommodation problems and without reference to other criteria.  The extensive prisons building programme will provide 2,000 extra prison places. On completion this programme will address the deficit in prison accommodation and alleviate the need to consider granting temporary releases to offenders because of a shortage of prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>Before granting temporary release careful consideration is given to a number of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence.  The overriding concern when decisions are being made in individual cases, is the safety of the public.</P>
    <P>It is long-standing policy, however, that persons serving sentences for serious crimes such as sex offences, importation or supply of drugs, armed robbery &mdash; including robberies where a syringe was used &mdash; and other cases involving serious violence are not granted periods of temporary release except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours to attend a funeral to full temporary release or early release, which is, in effect, our system of parole. Parole, a feature of prison systems world-wide, is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  In addition, it must be said, that in a substantial number of cases the timing of the consideration of a prisoner for temporary release may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>Each case of early release is considered on the basis of the views of the governor of the institution in which the offender is imprisoned, the Garda Síochána and, if relevant, any recommendations of the Sentence Review Group, taking into consideration such matters as any threat to the community which might arise, the nature of the offence, the offenders' behaviour while in custody and any compassionate grounds which might merit special consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 183 and 184 together.</P>
      <P>Various treatment options for drug addiction are available to inmates in the prison system.  This treatment is provided as part of the general medical service available to all inmates.  It is not possible to quantify in the time available precisely the number of inmates undergoing medically supervised treatment for drug addiction at any one time in all 14 prison institutions.</P>
      <P>The majority of inmates with drug use problems are in custody in prison institutions in the Dublin area and in Mountjoy Prison in particular. During 1997, approximately 1,650 inmates benefited from the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme operated under medical supervision in Mountjoy Prison.  In addition, about 130 inmates have been admitted to the drug treatment unit which opened in Mountjoy Prison in July 1996.  This unit is modelled on hospital based units in the community and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by gradually reducing dosages of substitutes.  The drug treatment programme in Mountjoy Prison is under review at present with a view to its expansion as appropriate.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the various treatment options available to drug addicts in prison are making a positive contribution to both the fight against drug abuse generally in Irish society today and to the health of the individual inmates who have the motivation to deal with their addiction. I accept that more work is needed to extend the range of drug treatment facilities in the prison system and my Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expansion of drug treatment options generally.  Progress in this respect is constrained for the present by the serious limitations imposed by overcrowding in our committal prisons.  This constraint will be greatly lessened as the prison building programme proceeds.</P>

This provision does not confer citizenship on the child of a nonnational who, at the time of the child's birth is entitled to diplomatic immunity in the State.</P>
      <P>The Interdepartmental Committee on Immigration, Asylum and Related Issues recommended that legislation be examined to see what changes might be possible to eliminate abuses of Irish citizenship law in regard to post-nuptial zenship and the deliberate arrangement of births to non-nationals here.</P>
      <P>This recommendation is being considered in the light of the commitments in the British-Irish Agreement of 10 April and its implementation.</P>

The institute explained that tuition fees for part-time music courses provided by the institute have remained relatively static and quite low over the past decade while the costs of providing high quality music education have continued to rise.  The institute further explained that due consideration was given to the need to reach a balance between fees and costs, and to the implications of raising fees for part-time tuition. The institute also pointed out that the new rates seek to restore some balance but still remain significantly below those offered by comparable institutions.  A scholarship scheme for talented students continues to operate, as does the institute's policy on fee waivers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 199 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the restructuring of the senior cycle the transition year option was introduced in second level schools.  The transition year is a year between the end of the junior certificate programme and the beginning of the leaving certificate programme.  There is no provision for a transition year at anytime beyond this in the senior cycle.</P>
      <P>It is for the management authority of each school to decide whether to provide transition year and the number of places in its transition year.  In making this choice, schools are subject to the same constraints as apply to their general curriculum choice.  Schools try as far as possible to provide a range of curriculum or programme options to meet the needs of all pupils.</P>
      <P>Where a school is unable to facilitate all pupils seeking a place on its transition year programme, it is necessary for the school to select pupils. Schools may use selection criteria including their assessment of all of their pupils' needs and suitability for the programme.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Salesian College may have been unable to allocate a place on its transition year programme to the pupil in question.  I would suggest that his parents contact the school principal to discuss the matter.</P>
