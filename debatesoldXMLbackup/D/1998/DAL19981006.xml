    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 29, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The visit of President and Mrs. Clinton to Ireland earlier this month was extremely successful. I was delighted the President and First Lady, who are true friends of Ireland, were able to pay a second visit here.  Their visit in particular helped the efforts of the two Governments to give an added momentum to the political process in Northern Ireland.  It also had an important economic dimension.</P>
      <P>At our meeting on Friday, 4 September, the President and I focused primarily on Northern Ireland and the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.  I took the opportunity to thank him for his commitment, restated in Belfast, to continue his support for the implementation of the Agreement.  I also reiterated to him our appreciation of his tremendous positive input to the process.  The President renewed his commitment to do whatever he could to advance the cause of peace and assured me of his continued support in maintaining the momentum.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity at our meeting to raise with him the issue of the military strikes on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan.  The President explained the security and intelligence basis on which the decisions had been taken.</P>
      <P>Following our meeting, President Clinton and I attended a reception and lunch at the Royal College of Surgeons, celebrating social partnership in Ireland, attended by a large number of participants in such partnership, at national and local level, throughout the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President and I paid tribute to the social partnership model which over the past decade has helped to transform our economy.  The President went on to cite Ireland as an example in building bridges to other nations as an open economy and by facilitating and encouraging business ventures from around the world.  He also cited the British-Irish <Col N="921" /> Agreement as a model for conflict resolution in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Later on Friday, the President and I visited Gateway in Clonshaugh, Dublin.  The visit provided an excellent opportunity to showcase to the rest of the world, particularly to potential investors, some of the latest high technology now typical of Ireland.  It was also an opportunity for us to make a significant piece of history by becoming the first two leaders to sign an international communiqué electronically using technology pioneered by an Irish company, Baltimore Technologies. This event highlighted Ireland as being at the forefront of information technology development. It highlights too our willingness and ability to develop an environment in which electronic commerce will flourish.  President Clinton remarked that &ldquo;Ireland is fast becoming the technological capital of Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 5 September, President Clinton visited Limerick, where I was very happy to introduce him to a large and very enthusiastic gathering at a civic reception in O'Connell Street at which he was awarded the freedom of the city in recognition of his outstanding contribution to peace.  The President gave an inspiring address in which he urged the people of Ireland to press forward with the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement and to resist the efforts of those few who would seek to undermine it.</P>
    <P>In the course of his visit the President and I paid tribute to the dedication and achievements of Senator George Mitchell, Ambassador Jean Kennedy-Smith and other members of the delegation accompanying the President, who have worked so hard to bring us to the present positive situation where we are moving towards the full implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's firm determination that all paramilitary violence should cease forthwith and that was the main purpose of the legislation passed by this House, post-Omagh.  Since the House met in early September the INLA and the so-called Real IRA have declared ceasefires.  In the INLA's case, this was in train prior to Omagh. Only the Continuity IRA has still not responded to the will of the people.</P>
    <P>Regarding the announcement by the so-called Real IRA of a complete cessation of violence, I have already made known my views on this in a statement I issued on 8 September.  I made clear that, on the basis that its statement was put fully into effect and was final, it represented a positive development.  I made clear also that, irrespective of that statement of cessation, the determination of the two Governments to bring to justice the perpetrators of the Omagh atrocity will not be diminished.  Ultimately, it remains to be demonstrated how real this ceasefire will prove to be.  I do not have any indications that it is other than real.  However, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>There have been no direct contacts between my Department and the so-called Real IRA or <Col N="922" /> with the 32 County Sovereignty Committee since Omagh.  At the same time since the British-Irish Agreement, I have sought to ensure publicly and through those whose pastoral work brings them into contact with every section of the community that the Government's and the people's total opposition to any attempt to continue a terrorist campaign or even to justify one is clearly understood and acted upon.  The Government's firm and decisive response post-Omagh with the support of the Dáil helped achieve a suspension, then a ceasefire and also minimised pressure on other ceasefires.</P>
    <P>I have been meeting and liaising intensively over the summer, particularly after Omagh, with the parties and others, including the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, First Minister, Mr. Trimble, Deputy First Minister, Mr. Mallon, SDLP leader, Mr. Hume, Sinn Féin leader, Mr. Gerry Adams, and Secretary of State, Dr. Mo Mowlam.  There have also been a number of meetings over the past ten days.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to report in detail on each meeting or telephone conversation I have relating to Northern Ireland.  However, most recently, we have been focusing, as I will continue to do in future meetings when required, on progressing the implementation of the provisions of the British-Irish Agreement.  We all recognise that there are many difficult issues to be faced, but all our efforts must be focused on maintaining the momentum towards the full implementation of the Agreement in all its aspects without new preconditions. With vision and leadership on all sides, we will succeed in turning into reality what people voted for on 22 May.</P>
    <P>Two aspects need to be borne in mind.  The entire spirit of the Agreement is inclusive and implementation can only be on that basis, but, equally, it is not open to any party or associated organisation to say that a certain part of the Agreement will not happen.  Good faith has to be demonstrated all round.  Implementation of the Agreement does not, as its critics on all sides spuriously pretend, constitute surrender on anyone's part.</P>
    <P>Every party should do willingly what is asked of it in the Agreement as early as it can and not hold back, waiting for others.  If everyone acts in a forthcoming way, the two Governments will act to ensure that all commitments are fulfilled and that no-one's interests suffer from them being too forward.  In any dispute that arises, we must ensure that the broader public interest prevails. Necessary preparatory work in my Department and others has been pressed forward in recent weeks to ensure that the timetable for implementation envisaged when the Agreement was reached is respected.</P>
    <P>I recently met the chairman of the Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, Mr. Chris Patten.  I wished him well in his very important undertaking and assured him the Government would assist and facilitate him in any way he thought appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> I met Archbishop Desmond Tutu last Wednesday.  During our meeting we reviewed current developments and the implementation to date of the British-Irish Agreement.  The Archbishop and I agreed on the importance of accommodation and dialogue in resolving conflict.  I conveyed to the Archbishop our view that the South African experience provided a model for negotiation, agreement and conflict resolution.</P>
    <P>On the issue of further meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, whether a meeting of the forum is to be convened is not a matter for me or the Government, but the chairperson and all the participating parties.  As Deputies are aware, meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation were suspended as a result of the breakdown of the Provisional IRA ceasefire in February 1996.  The forum was reconvened in December 1997, some time after the restoration of the Provisional IRA ceasefire, with the broad intention that it should meet at intervals of two to three months.</P>
    <P>I understand that on the two occasions some time ago when inquiries were made of the participating parties as to their views on further meetings, a range of responses were received. However, the preponderant view was against holding a meeting.  It was clear from the responses that this essentially reflected the preoccupation of the parties with the intensive work of the multi-party negotiations leading to the British-Irish Agreement.  While I understand further inquiries as to parties' views have not been made since then, it was abundantly clear that the time and energies of the parties were entirely focused on, successively, the referenda campaigns, North and South, the election campaign in the North, the Drumcree crisis, the Northern Ireland Bill, the Omagh atrocity and, now, the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement with some brief periods for holidays.</P>
    <P>It may be that the preponderant view among the parties would be that they would prefer to concentrate on the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.  It is best to wait a little longer until the overall political situation clarifies further before initiating further inquiries as to the wishes of parties participating in the forum.  I will be happy to adhere to the preponderant view of the parties overall, whatever that may prove to be.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement under Strand Two, paragraph 18, envisages that the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas would consider developing a joint parliamentary forum, bringing together equal numbers from both institutions for discussions of matters of mutual interest and concern.  Perhaps it is in that direction that we should look for the future.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has given a comprehensive reply to 29 questions and I wish to ask a number of supplementary questions.  He referred to his discussion with the President of the United States.  Regarding the military attack by the <Col N="924" /> United States on Sudan and Afghanistan, the Taoiseach indicated that President Clinton gave him a briefing on the security information that was available.  The Taoiseach did not go further in his response.  Did the Taoiseach ask him the legal basis on which the United States justified its attacks on Khartoum and Afghanistan and, if so, what was his response?</P>

I outlined the European Union's response and asked if he would be willing to co-operate with the inquiry which had been announced.  He said that he would and would make all the security intelligence available.  I also asked about the civilian casualties and highlighted what we said at the time.  The President explained at some length when we met privately and as part of a delegation that the United States was at war with certain terrorist movements and highlighted the efforts they were making to defeat them.</P>

The United States is not a member of the European Union and there are no sanctions that the European Union can impose if the United States is found to have acted illegally under the United Nations charter.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the United Nations should be asked to conduct the inquiry in line with the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, who agreed that this would be a legitimate request?  Does the Taoiseach consider that the information provided by President Clinton justified the bombing of Sudan in view of information in the international media that the factory bombed and the people injured had nothing to do with chemical bomb making, the alleged excuse for the bombing?</P>

      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with President Clinton the then ongoing genocidal aggression by the Serbs in Kosovo, and does he see some contrast between the reticence of the reaction of the west to the genocidal policies being pursued against Muslims in Kosovo and the more prompt approach of the United States to attacks on targets in Afghanistan and Khartoum? Will he endorse the suggestion recently made to overcome the difficulties that have arisen in the formation of the shadow Executive and in relation to decommissioning, that the IRA, of its own accord, would put out of commission some of its aggressive weaponry such as semtex which does not have any defensive purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first matter raised by Deputy Bruton, at that time we spoke about issues concerning various trouble spots around the world.  That issue was raised but we did not <Col N="926" /> have any detailed discussion on it.  I take the Deputy's point, however, and I said last week at another forum that in some locations throughout the world action seems to take place very quickly while in other areas such as Kosovo it seems to take a great deal of time before anything useful happens.  The President's reply to me at the time was that they were keeping their senior people involved in that difficulty which has escalated since those meetings in early September to the current dangerous level.</P>
      <P>On the second matter, I have had a number of meetings with Mr. John Hume over the summer. I agree with him on the need to make progress on this issue.  I particularly agree with him that if the IRA were to make its position absolutely clear in relation to the British-Irish Agreement, especially the decommissioning aspects, that would restore trust and confidence and help us get around this dilemma.  Equally, if the IRA were to bring forward either a timetable or action in regard to the abandonment of their weapons, that would be an even greater help.  I understand the difficulties of all parties and have listened to them all at length.  Unionists are not convinced and they have a legitimate point in that they have seen no arms disposed of, though all those arms are to be disposed of, not as a precondition but over the next 18 months.  They would like to see that happen; they want deeds rather than words. On the other hand, Sinn Féin believes that this is not a precondition and that they should not have to put further pressure on the IRA at this stage because they have already stated that they will do all they can over the period of the Agreement to make sure decommissioning happens.  Sinn Féin feels it should not have to do anything further now.</P>
      <P>I believe that both sides must move to the centre. There is legitimacy in both sides' core concerns, but it would be helpful in moving matters if people moved sooner rather than later and if obstacles were not created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the stated Sinn Féin position, both in the Agreement and in every meeting I have had with it, that it supports decommissioning arms within the two year period, and while Sinn Féin has no arms, it will do everything it can to see that the organisation over which it has influence, the IRA, will decommission its arms.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> I protest that the Taoiseach lumped so many issues into one response.  It is quite unrealistic and impossible to elucidate information on matters relating to the US attacks on Afghanistan and Sudan as well as the serious situation in the North.  It was wrong of the Taoiseach.  He should have separated them so that each issue could be pursued separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Taoiseach's discussions with President Clinton, is it the case that he swallowed entirely the American intelligence story concerning the cruise missile attacks on Sudan and Afghanistan? In the former case, the bombing was carried out without a shred of evidence.  In the latter case, there was evidence of where the camps were because the United States intelligence forces built them for a campaign of terror against the previous <Col N="928" /> Afghan Government.  Did the Taoiseach at least protest to President Clinton about the risk to life and limb of innocent people in launching these irresponsible flying bombs?</P>
    <P>Regarding Northern Ireland, did the Taoiseach raise with the Prime Minister in this or previous discussions the situation of Danny McNamee and his appeal, which will be heard on 9 November? He was convicted in 1987 for the horrific Hyde Park bombing of 1982.  The evidence presented was derisory and there is a strong body of opinion that he is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I were to take each question individually at a time when 70 to 80 have been tabled, very little progress would be made. We completed three questions last week in 55 minutes.  The grouping is not unfair in that 95 per cent of the questions concerned relate to the North.</P>
      <P>I raised with President Clinton the concern of the Irish public about the atrocities in Sudan and Afghanistan and gave him an opportunity to explain his position.  I did not take issue with him about them but I put the point of view of many Irish people, both inside and outside the House, concerning these actions.</P>

Why did he not take issue with President Clinton and state clearly that this was a serious breach of international law?  The Taoiseach said he put the concerns of the Irish people.

      <P>I agree with Deputy Higgins that bundling questions together does not allow for a comprehensive reply.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement is far behind schedule given that the Agreement states a work programme for the Executive and the all-Ireland ministerial council must be ready by 31 October?  Does he acknowledge that decommissioning has been comprehensively dealt with in the agreement to which all parties have committed themselves?  Does he also acknowledge that Sinn Féin has fulfilled its obligations to the letter and that there cannot be any rewriting of the agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are delays.  The Irish and British Governments are firmly of the view that the agreement must be implemented in all its aspects.  We recognise the tight timeframe.  We also recognise that the Executive should be meeting by now and that the North-South ministerial body should be meeting before the end of October to discuss the aspects of the implementation bodies agreed.  That process is falling behind and is likely to fall further behind as some of the key players are on economic business and there are conferences.  It will take some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority for the Governments is to continue to work on all aspects of the agreement and to find ways to resolve obstacles and logjams. Deputy Ó Caoláin is correct that there is no precondition in the British-Irish Agreement on decommissioning taking place before the Executive meets.  However, I have to deal with a situation in which others, mainly the Ulster Unionist Party, ask me if I am absolutely sure there will be no difficulties with decommissioning down the road and that the arms will be taken out of the equation.  The Ulster Unionist Party is quick to point out that while Sinn Féin states there will be <Col N="930" /> decommissioning, the IRA has said the opposite on two occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a difficulty I have to try to explain to the other side.  I must endeavour to continually move both sides to achieve common ground and to deal with this issue.  That is why there are delays.  Prior decommissioning is not strictly in the terms of the Agreement but it creates a real obstacle and a real difficulty.  As Taoiseach I have to try to find a way around these issues.  I accept that there is good faith and that people want to have confidence in the Agreement. However, we have to convince people on both sides on different issues.  Decommissioning is a problem for the Unionists.  As far as Sinn Féin is concerned there are issues such as the North-South bodies and demilitarisation on which we are moving ahead.</P>
      <P>When Deputy John Bruton recently asked me why people in the republican movement would not have confidence, I answered that it was because there had been no demilitarisation.  That is not the current situation.  Soldiers have been withdrawn and some army checkpoints have been removed.  Other activities are taking place.  There has to be confidence on all sides.  While prior decommissioning is not strictly in the terms of the agreement, it is the reality with which I have to deal.</P>

There is an abiding responsibility on both Governments and on the Taoiseach to ensure the terms of the Agreement are pursued to the letter.

When I press for further prison releases, fewer soldiers on the streets, more military installations to be taken down etc., it is legitimate for others to ask about a timescale and what is happening on another issue.  It is not an unreasonable position in which to be put, and I have to try to balance these concerns. It is not a question of everything being implemented on one side and nobody doing anything on the other side.  That is the difficulty.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from the Taoiseach's replies to supplementaries that he has met the Sinn Féin leadership on a number of occasions this autumn.  On a previous occasion in the House he said as far as he was concerned Sinn Féin and <Col N="931" /> the IRA were two sides of the one coin.  Does he still hold that view and, if so, will he agree that the Sinn Féin leadership has an obligation to deliver on that aspect of the Agreement, alongside all its other components?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I still hold that view.  Sinn Féin would rightly say when this matter was discussed in the negotiations there was not a reference to a timetable except that Sinn Féin would do its utmost to convince the IRA to decommission its arms in the two year period.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has instructed its senior negotiator, Mr. Martin McGuinness, to work with General John de Chastelain in a meaningful way. I understand those talks are constructive and meaningful and that Sinn Féin is honouring the Agreement to achieve a method of dealing with these issues.  There has been progress in those areas.  It comes back to the legitimate core issue of trust on both sides.  While arms are still in circulation the Unionists ask whether there will ever be decommissioning and if people will return to the troubles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other side Sinn Féin nationalist republicans are concerned that Sinn Féin would make all the moves and not achieve establishment of the Executive.  If it succeeds in getting the Executive established it wonders whether another wall will be erected before the setting up of the North-South ministerial bodies.  If it succeeds in getting the North-South ministerial bodies established it fears the implementation bodes may be blocked. They have seen a leaked paper put forward by the Unionists which says they will not take these issues seriously.  Therefore there is still a basic lack of trust on both sides.  We should not be surprised by this, but we must try to manage it and convince both sides.  I am not in the business of condemning either side but rather of convincing both sides that they must move to understand their respective positions in terms of the legitimate core issues.  It would be dangerous not to <Col N="932" /> do this and we are still engaged in the process of convincing them to do so.</P>

      <P>Decommissioning is important, something acknowledged in the Agreement by virtue of the time limit on when decommissioning should take place.  Sinn Féin has signed up to this.  Given the importance of keeping all sides on board in terms of the Agreement, a declaration of intent at the very least from Sinn Féin that decommissioning will begin and take place is not too much to ask for, to ensure that one of the key pillars to the Agreement, the Ulster Unionist Party, can be retained within the process.  Given that Gerry Adams made a statement that as far as he is concerned the war is over &mdash; he did not say it as clearly as that, but we all read the statement to mean this &mdash; and that he could not have made such a statement without at least the acquiescence of the IRA, will the Taoiseach indicate whether during his meeting with Mr. Adams next week he will impress upon him the urgency of a declaration of intent at the very least regarding decommissioning of weapons and ensure that Sinn Féin is doing everything it can to persuade the IRA to carry out decommissioning? On previous occasions Sinn Féin claimed to be persuaders in terms of the IRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It has said so, as in signing the Agreement it undertook to do all in its power to ensure decommissioning happens within two years.  I and others are now asking Sinn Féin to try to overcome the understandable political obstacle which exists concerning trust on the Unionist side, something which is admittedly and clearly not in the Agreement.  We are asking the party to go further than what is in the Agreement. There has been progress in that Martin McGuinness and General John de Chastelain are working successfully in moving things forward.  I have said before and repeat now that a more proximate view of how this programme will operate would be extremely helpful and I do not see the difficulty with this suggestion.  However, the Deputy is aware that my suggestion did not receive much support in terms of a timetable. Nonetheless, I still think it provides one way of getting around the issue and I am not sure whether there is another way around it.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that in the last fortnight a man had his second leg amputated as a result of a punishment shooting by a paramilitary organisation and that such an occurrence is quite common?  Have there been significant numbers of punishment shootings and beatings by loyalist and republican paramilitaries since the British-Irish Agreement?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the paramilitaries involved are <Col N="933" /> adopting a &ldquo;no claim, no blame&rdquo; tactic in regard to such acts, but that they are responsible for them?  Is he aware that one requirement of the pledge of office of a Minister is a commitment to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and democratic means and that, therefore, there is a difficulty for Ministers who are part of an organisation &mdash; one side of a coin to use the Taoiseach's phrase &mdash; which is carrying out punishment beatings such as that to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably, punishment beatings still occur, although not on the same scale as in the past.  However, some very serious attacks have been carried out from which fatalities have resulted.  The House will recall a person being left to die in a lift following a shooting some time ago.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is correct in saying it is not as easy as it previously was to identify the people involved in these attacks.  With the assistance of the British Government, the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and pastoral leaders, we are trying to ensure punishment beatings cease entirely. Some progress has been made in that regard with models of community policing being developed in conjunction with the authorities.  Communities are attempting to deal with these matters in a non-threatening and non-violent way.  Quite frankly, I believe it will prove difficult to eliminate punishment beatings entirely.  Nobody knows what some of these groups stand for and we must await the outcome of the conclusions of the policing commission on that, a view shared by Chris Patten.  Anyone involved in punishment beatings and similar activities is in breach of the Mitchell Principles, the British-Irish Agreement and the ground rules document.</P>

      <P>Last week, it was announced that the Government had agreed to make £10 million available to deal with winter fodder difficulties.  In addition, the Minister announced he had sought European Commission approval to continue the sheep headage top-up, equivalent to £2.75 million.</P>
      <P>The sheep headage top-up will be paid on the basis of the normal sheep headage applications already on hand in the Department.  Details of the allocation of the £10 million fund are being finalised at present.  It is intended that the measure will be geared towards certain farms in the areas identified as worse affected by the weather and mountain sheep farmers.  Particular attention will be paid to ensuring that the administrative arrangement will facilitate early payment to individual farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that farmers, the farming organisations and everybody else have had an opportunity to look at the package, we can only say the fodder scheme is a bit like a lucky bag &mdash; one never knows what will come out of it, but one <Col N="935" /> can be sure it will be valueless.  What is needed is a doubling of the sheep premium.  That would cost £14 or £15 million, but hill sheep farmers will get very little of the £2.7 million.  This is the first time ever that a Minister has been unable to say in respect of a package being put together how many or which farmers will benefit.  Obviously there was huge Government panic to have something ready for the ploughing championship.</P>
      <P>Am I to take it that this help, limited though it is, will be confined to farmers in the designated wetland areas, or will farmers everywhere who have suffered because of the weather on wet land, wherever they are, be able to apply?  They have the same problem &mdash; wet land is wet land wherever it is.  Where do the Government and the Department stand on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that £10 million is small money on top of the other measures being taken.  It was the unusual weather in June and July this year, particularly the lack of sunshine, that caused many of our problems. Although August was an improvement, recent bad weather has again escalated the problem.  The Deputy will be aware of the Teagasc report on the areas in question and the Minister recognises the need for this.  I would remind the Deputy of the additional measures being taken to help farmers in the current crisis.  They include speeding up direct payments to farmers; increasing suckler cow and beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent which will release an additional £45 million in November and December; more rapid payment under the rural environment protection scheme; the payment of outstanding top-ups of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October; the Teagasc advisory service to advise farmers how they can best feed their animals, which is totally free to farmers; the promotion of live exports; and the reopening of the Libyan trade.  The reason for the Minister's absence today is that he is in Tehran trying to open the Iranian trade.  There is also the substantial 5p per pound increase which it was stated would not be passed on to farmers.  Additional measures have been taken to improve the position of farmers.  The Deputy will accept that it is unusual that we should have to take these steps because of the weather.  However, it is being done and it is being geared towards the most needy farmers, particularly those mentioned in the Teagasc report which includes those in wetland areas.</P>

      <P>Regarding the Minister's talk about bringing forward premia that already exist, if cattle were selling at £100 a head more that premium would still be paid, so it is not extra.  As to how worthless this £10 million is, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, put it in context when he said that the family income supplement, costing £50 million, would include farmers.  This shows that to solve the problem would cost more <Col N="936" /> than £50 million, but all the Minister has come up with is £10 million.  The Cabinet should look again at this issue because there is a revolt around the country about what is being done.</P>

      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers introduced in 1994 under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry was suspended on 7 August 1997 when the available funding was exhausted.  Recognising the importance attached to this measure by young farmers embarking on their careers, I secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the reintroduction of a more tightly focused revised scheme targeted towards those smaller farmers most in need of assistance.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the farming organisations on the nature of the new scheme, my Department submitted the terms of a revised installation aid scheme to the Department of Finance and to the European Commission for approval in late July.</P>
      <P>In mid-September the Commission raised questions about the proposal which provided for accommodating young farmers who failed to make application under the earlier scheme before its suspension subject to their meeting the relevant eligibility criteria.  The Commission also sought clarification that the equivalent skills and competence qualifications of other member states would be recognised in determining eligibility under the proposed scheme.  My Department has responded quickly to the Commission on these issues and again stressed our desire to secure the earliest agreement for the new measure.</P>

I told the Minister the other night that they could not be facilitated in farming and they <Col N="937" /> have been told by the Department that they are ineligible for aid.

      <P>Why did we not seek approval from the EU Commission long before July if approval was needed?

      <P>This Government, in agreement and following talks with the various farming organisations, has brought forward a scheme.

    <P>A preliminary technical examination of the proposals was carried out over the following two <Col N="939" /> months and the proposals were again discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 25-26 May, when a progress report was prepared for the European Council in Cardiff on 15-16 June.  The report contained an undertaking that the dependence of the particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account.  That undertaking was in response to the Minister's request that the importance of beef and milk to the Irish economy should be acknowledged.  The report included, also at the Minister's request, a recognition of the need to avoid renationalisation of the CAP and distortion of competition.</P>
    <P>These commitments were copperfastened by the Taoiseach at the European Council in Cardiff when the 15 Heads of Government agreed that further negotiations should be based on the conclusions reached by the May Council.</P>
    <P>The European Council set the objective of achieving final adoption of the overall Agenda 2000 proposals before the next European Parliament elections in June 1999 and specified that substantial progress should be made at the Vienna European Council on 11-12 December 1998 on the key elements of the package so that political agreement could be reached on the package as a whole no later than March 1999.</P>
    <P>Technical examination of the proposals is continuing in preparation for the meetings of the Council of Ministers in October and November. It is expected that the November meeting will make a further report to the European Council meeting to be held in Vienna on 11-12 December.</P>

    <P>In October 1997 I set up four consultative groups, one each for beef, milk, cereals and rural development and structures, to ensure that a wide range of expertise would be available to me throughout the negotiations.  These groups, which include farmers, processors and others with a direct interest, academics and officials of my Department, have been meeting regularly to discuss the proposals and advise on the appropriate response.  In addition, on 9 July 1998 I convened a seminar bringing together the members of all the groups.  The purpose of the seminar was to facilitate the work of the four groups by ensuring that each of them was aware of the situation in the other three groups and providing for an all-round exchange of views.  The consultative process is, in effect, a national forum and its successful operation to date indicates that no other type of forum is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very informative reply.  Have we conducted any studies to analyse the impact of this on our national agrifood industry?  Have we set up a forum to do that?  How is this consultative forum working? Does it include members of all the various sectoral interests which would be affected by the proposed CAP reforms and the Agenda 2000 document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> Will the Minister agree that time is running out and that the Agenda 2000 proposals represent a major change in the CAP formulation?  Will he agree that the basic thrust of those proposals, as they are currently formulated, is to position the EU for the liberalisation of trade which will be the focus of the next world trade round?</P>
    <P>A document has recently emanated from DGVI in Brussels which gives an insight into the current thinking in this regard.  Have the Minister and his officials formulated a response to that?</P>
    <P>The beef industry is currently undergoing severe trauma.  Has the Department proposed any responses to the various exclusions which were very evident in relation to the MacSharry proposals? I instance the beef heifer area.  Will a heifer premium <i>per se</i> be proposed?  Has the Minister responded to the major increase of £175 in the bull premium, while the increase in the suckler cow premium was a miserable £6?  Have we formulated a detailed response or when will we formulate such a response?  Will the House debate the matter prior to the submission of proposals on the Agenda 2000 document?</P>

This consultative process is working well and it is felt there is no need for another forum to be involved.</P>
      <P>We are, of course, extremely adversely affected by the new proposals, particularly by the reduction of beef and dairy premia to create the national envelopes, the reduction of the main premium ceiling and of the suckler cow premium ceiling, and the abolition of the suckler cow supplementary payment and of intervention before price reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary responsibility for the marketing of cattle, sheep and pigs lies with the industry, in conjunction with An Bord Bia, which has statutory responsibility for this area.  Ministerial responsibility is to ensure there is adequate export support as well as unhindered access for Irish agricultural export markets worldwide, thereby allowing our industry the possibility of exploiting every marketing opportunity.  Accordingly, priority has been given to removing any BSE-related trade restrictions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cattle trade a number of recent developments should help to provide increased support for the market.  The re-opening of the Libyan market for live cattle from Ireland has been secured and it is expected that shipping will start shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While the number of cattle to be shipped before 31 December 1998 is a commercial decision between the live exporters involved and the Libyan authorities, I expect that a significant number of live cattle will be exported to Libya before the end of the year.  I am confident adequate shipping capacity is available for cattle exports to the Libyan market.  There are currently some ten dedicated livestock vessels approved for the export of cattle from Ireland, with two additional vessels under consideration. Further vessel inspections are due to take place in the next couple of weeks.</P>
      <P>The resumption of the live trade to Libya, combined with the substantial increase in export refunds on cattle and beef which was agreed by the beef management committee on 26 September, will improve the competitiveness of Irish cattle and beef exports on third country markets and should enable our processors to pay higher prices for cattle to our producers.  The Minister is at present in Iran, with a view to securing the lifting of the BSE-related ban.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the difficulties in the Russian market have had a serious impact on the Irish beef industry. In view of this, the Minister has asked the Commission to introduce an EU-sponsored export credit insurance scheme in order to encourage European exporters to resume exports to Russia.  The introduction of such a scheme, combined with the increase in export refunds, would facilitate an orderly commercial export trade in that market.</P>
      <P>As far as the sheep trade is concerned, the Minister attended an An Bord Bia promotion of lamb in Madrid recently.  A vessel has also been approved for a trial shipment of lamb to the continent. The recent introduction of an aids to private storage scheme for lamb should help to underpin the autumn lamb market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to pigmeat, I have taken steps to ensure traders will be able to compete on world markets and to exploit every export opportunity. Earlier in the summer I sought and received <Col N="942" /> increased export refunds from the EU Commission. In May, export refunds were introduced and in August they were further increased.  In view of the continued weakness in the export market, in particular in the Russian market, I raised the question of a further increase last week at the Agriculture Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Additional information:</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have also been successful in getting the Commission to agree to an aids to private storage scheme to support the market at this time.  The scheme, which is effective from 28 September, provides EU funding for the storage of up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat, destined for export to third countries, for up to six months prior to shipment. The scheme not only allows exporters time to find a market for their produce but also entitles them to export refunds.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent sale of 10,000 tonnes of intervention beef to Russia, this was part of an intervention destocking programme which the European Commission embarked upon earlier this year before the onset of the Russian crisis. My understanding is that in deciding to proceed with the sale to Russia the Commission took the view that, since the Russian market was effectively closed for the present to commercial exports, the sale of intervention beef would not be displacing commercial trade.  It has been strongly emphasised to the EU Commission that the sale of intervention beef should not undermine the existing commercial trading structures which have been built up in recent years, and that an ultra-cautious approach towards the disposal of intervention stocks should be pursued at this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish the senior Minister well in Iran and hope the Ministers of State will convey our views to him.  When will the Libyan trade open?  This is on the lips of every farmer, particularly yesterday when prices hit an all-time low at Irish marts &mdash; whatever about factory prices, heavy cattle changed hands yesterday at 74 and 75 pence per pound.  Has something gone wrong with the Libyan trade?  I want it to work and I know the Minister does also but if something is wrong it should be explained to the House.</P>
      <P>Why did we agree to the offloading of intervention beef in Russia at a time when we were trying to sell directly into that market?  That was the same as blocking Irish beef.  In talking about the large numbers in the Libyan trade, the Minister mentioned that a number of boats were available and at the ploughing championships one of his colleagues stated that 100,000 cattle could be shipped between now and the end of the year. That would take a lot of shipping and a couple of weeks have been lost already.</P>
      <P>I welcome the trip to Iran but why was it not made two months ago?  This reminds me of a man who wants to live in a house by Christmas but applies for planning permission on 1 December.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Court of Justice delivered judgment in favour of the EU Commission on 1 October 1998.  Ireland had appealed the EU Commission's decision to disallow £50,243,111, or 10 per cent and 5 per cent of intervention beef expenditure in 1990 and 1991 in respect of the control system for intervention beef, and £18,475,350 or 2 per cent of intervention beef expenditure in 1991 and 1992 in respect of tendering procedures for beef purchased into intervention.  The court upheld the Commission position as regards weaknesses in the control system for beef intervention in 1990 and 1991 and ruled that the Commission had taken account of measures by Ireland to remedy these when it reduced the 1991 penalty from 10 to 5 per cent. <Col N="945" /> As regards tendering, the court ruled that there had been an infringement of article 9(2) of regulation No. 859/89 and that member states have a general obligation to take the measures necessary to satisfy themselves that the transactions financed by the EAGGF are executed correctly even if the specific Community Act does not expressly provide for the adoption of particular supervisory measures.  The court also rejected similar appeals lodged by Denmark, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In budgetary terms, the judgment has no immediate effect in that the transfer of the amount of disallowance to the EU budget took place when the Commission took the clearance decision in 1996.  The disallowance arose during a period when it was necessary to have consideration of intervention support because of a market collapse in the beef sector and the Department's control systems were put under enormous pressure by annual intake levels of more than a quarter of a million tonnes or 750,000 animals.  Since that period control systems have been considerably improved with the assistance partly of increased resources, and a subsequent EU Commission inquiry into intervention beef controls at slaughter plants and cold stores endorsed these improvements.</P>
      <P>While it is disappointing that the court has confirmed the disallowance, the judgment emphasises the need for continuous vigilant controls to ensure sound management of annual EAGGF payments of £1.3 billion in Ireland.  Ireland's performances in recent years compares favourably with other member states but the aim must be to have control systems in place which eliminate disallowances entirely.</P>

      <P>The possibility of disallowances relating to the beef sector were examined by a group of senior officials from my Department, the Attorney General and the Department of Finance, and the group reported to the Departments of Finance and Agriculture in 1996.  The legal advice obtained did not in itself give any entitlement to the Minister to recover any part from incumbents who may have featured in cases against Ireland by the European court.  We cannot sustain a case.  I am not aware of what was said at the Committee of Public Accounts or of article 8 of the European regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 236 together.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for marketing meat and meat products lies with the industry in conjunction with An Bord Bia, which is statutorily charged with the promotion of food products.</P>
      <P>Ministerial responsibility is to ensure unhindered access for Irish meat and meat products to markets worldwide, thereby allowing our industry the possibility of exploiting every marketing opportunity.  Accordingly, priority has been given to the removal of any BSE related trade restrictions.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that, of our more important traditional markets, only Iran continues to maintain restrictions on imports from Ireland and considerable success has been achieved in removing restrictions in other markets.  The Minister is at present in Iran with a view to securing the lifting of the ban on Irish beef.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, the Minister visited the UK to directly and successfully intervene when the major UK retail chains discontinued selling Irish beef.  In May the Minister attended the Cairo Agro Food Fair and had discussions with his Egyptian counterpart to assist continued access for Irish beef to a market, which has now become our second largest after the UK.  In addition, the Department continues to have regular contact with the authorities in the Gulf states.  In July a delegation from Libya came to this country and a positive outcome to the reopening of that market has been secured.  There has also been a ministerial presence at a number of Irish meat promotions throughout the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these market specific actions, discussions <Col N="951" /> have been taking place with An Bord Bia and the industry about the need to increase sales of Irish beef in the EU markets.  Accordingly, a beef marketing strategy to achieve this has been prepared by An Bord Bia and is under discussion with the industry.  The general approach and timing of beef promotion within the EU is crucial.  A number of labelling programmes have been approved by my Department to facilitate this trade.  There are signs that Irish beef is regaining its market share in some of the important EU markets in recent months and the marketing strategy will be aimed at boosting this trend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the information the Minister of State has given us has not resulted in a price increase for producers, which is what this is all about.  I remember when his party was on this side of the House, its members advised us how simple it was to get these markets reopened. I welcome the fact that the Minister is in Iran at present, even if he is some 15 months late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State any details as to whether that market will be reopened, when the boat will sail to Libya and when boats carrying live cattle will sail to Egypt? If the Minister is not successful in this the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; if he can get agreement from his civil servants &mdash; should travel there.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in negotiations in Iran.  I understand that meetings are taking place now between officials from my Department and other officials.  We expect that if that market reopens it will take 20,000 tonnes of carcase beef from Ireland which would be very welcome.</P>
      <P>Regarding Libya, all diplomatic negotiations have been completed.  My Department has concluded work on the business side in terms of regulations, boats and other matters.  It now remains a commercial decision for the exporters and traders who have to carry out their work.  I understand they are purchasing cattle, the traders are organising ships and that a ship is due to sail on 10 October.</P>

      <P>Regarding markets at home and abroad, does the Minister of State recognise the collapse in pig prices has hit farmers very badly, particularly in the Border counties of Cavan and Monaghan, as it has come at a time when farmers there, particularly in Cavan, have been deprived for months of a vital outlet for their product in terms of McCarrens meat plant in Cavan town?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State consider An Bord Bia has the necessary resources to promote our beef products and, if not, has he any plans to provide additional funding to it for that purpose?  Has he spoken to the owners of Irish supermarkets to encourage them to promote and reduce the price of Irish beef because price reductions are not being passed on to the consumer? We should address this problem at the local level because the Government has failed to reopen our export markets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Browne's question, since the Government took office it has worked vigorously on behalf of farmers to reopen our live cattle export markets.  We have been successful because the figures last year were 23,000 and the current figure is 90,000.  That represents real progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Deputy O'Caoláin's question on the pig industry, the pig industry is going through a difficult period because there is a peak in the cycle.  The Deputy will be aware there has always been peaks and valleys in the pig industry.  We have had very high numbers produced here, but prices are depressed now.  As the McCarren's plant in Cavan is a private operation, the Government does not have any influence there.  Negotiations have taken place with the plant.  I do not understand the problem there, but matters have improved in the pig industry generally.  Our slaughters are up to date and all the surplus has been killed.  I am not aware of any problem other than the market problem in terms of a fall in price.  Enterprise Ireland has been in negotiations in regard to securing additional processing facilities and McCarren's would have been involved in them.  As late as last week some discussions took place with Forbairt in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Ring's question, An Bord Bia is doing an excellent job on behalf of agriculture in promoting beef, lamb, pork and speciality foods.  We are exporting £6 billion of foodstuffs.  An Bord Bia has an ambitious five year programme worth £8 billion.  The total value of Irish foodstuffs is in the region of £10 billion. A total of 33 per cent of Irish business is based <Col N="953" /> on agriculture.  Our livestock numbers are high and we must realise that many of the markets to which we export products are in recession, particularly those in the Pacific Rim.  The Russian market has collapsed and we are trying to reopen Third World markets.  Therefore, we have to reassess the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a case of introducing legislation to resolve either problem.  As I stated last week, the interim report of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Public Enterprise outlines the Government's short-term action plan on road infrastructure, the DTO plans, bus corridors, new <Col N="955" /> buses, improvements in DART services and railway lines and the proposals on Luas.  None of these matters requires legislation.  Legislation does not solve problems.  Only action solves them and the Government is taking action.</P>
      <P>Regarding the housing issue which has created much concern in recent years, the Government commissioned the Bacon report and has taken action on it.  The issue of supply and demand is still involved.  Legislation has not changed that since Hanson's economic theory was developed. The Government is dealing with the matter through numerous measures initiated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.</P>

      <P>I refer to the section Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 36 seeks to change which deals with the functions of the Minister and states that each of the following shall be a function of the Minister under this Act: &ldquo;to ensure, subject to the provision of this Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs.  ..&rdquo;. This phrase underlines the sloppiness of the terminology in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Last week I stated that the House had been misled by the Minister last July in this regard.  The interpretation section of the Bill states that special educational needs are defined as the educational needs of students who have a disability and the educational needs of exceptionally able pupils.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 34 which was moved in the debate last week. Deputy O'Shea was in possession.  Amendment No. 35 is an alternative and No. 36 is related so it was agreed to take Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make an important point which will force us to recommit the Bill because of the sloppiness of the terminology.  If &ldquo;special educational needs&rdquo; means the educational needs of students who have a disability and exceptionally able students, two types of students come within the compass of this definition &mdash; gifted children and students with a disability.  However, in the section dealing with the functions of the <Col N="965" /> Minister it is obvious that it includes a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs.  According to the definition in the interpretation section, the only category other than people with a disability is the gifted children. If that is not the case, who are the other people with special educational needs?  That sloppiness in regard to the terminology has to be addressed in the interest of streamlining the legislation.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 36 Deputy Bruton seeks to ensure that, as a function of the Minister, people availing of education do so in suitable accommodation with appropriate support services and, where necessary, the co-ordination of other bodies in the provision of such support services.</P>
      <P>This amendment underlines a big problem in our system regarding the co-ordination of support services, particularly for students with special needs.  The Minister should redefine special education needs as per the working definition used by the special education review group, which included environmental factors.</P>
      <P>If children are behaving in a dysfunctional manner in school, outside support services, be they social workers or speech therapists, must be brought into play.  The system is quite <i>ad hoc</i> at present and, while the Minister may say he cannot legislate for other Departments, considerable resources are being paid for by the taxpayer, but optimum results are not being achieved.  Deputy Bruton's objective needs to be achieved and if that requires changes in legislation in other Departments, they will have to be made.  The Minister cannot deny there are increasing disciplinary difficulties with dysfunctional pupils in many schools.</P>
      <P>There can be co-operation between schools regarding pupils with special needs.  Special schools and vocational schools could provide services in addition to those provided by special schools.  The Minister agreed that there should be co-operation between schools, but the Bill should include Deputy Bruton's proposal regarding the functions of the Minister.  For instance, gifted pupils in primary school may benefit from lessons in second level schools to develop talents they may use as adults for the benefit of the community.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, this amendment seems to address a reasonable matter, but there are problems with this in the real world.  I would like to hear the Minister's views as to whether legislation from other Departments will be necessary.  For instance, if the probation service or the Garda are involved, that would include the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, while the Department of Environment and Local Government would be involved if housing were an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most important legislation the Dáil has dealt with since I became a Member.  I have major criticisms of the Bill.  The legislation should be tightened up to get the optimum value from the resources available in various Departments and agencies.  Those resources will have to be co-ordinated <Col N="966" /> in the interests of students with special needs and all other pupils.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in an unholy mess regarding the definition of special needs and if only for the sake of common sense, this should be tidied up.  Co-ordination is fundamental to addressing disadvantage in our education system, special education for gifted children and the needs of all children. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that there would be legal difficulties in this context, although I do not recall if it was with reference to this amendment.  I strongly support Deputy Bruton's amendment.  We should deal with the quagmire that has developed regarding the definition of special needs.  The Minister made a misleading statement last July when we started Report Stage and, more importantly, there are contradictions in this section and in the interpretation section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to keeping one's mind on matters.  I understand the Minister accepted that the issue of co-ordination is not trivial, but he sought refuge in the idea that no Minister can be expected to co-ordinate the services of other Departments. That response underlines the problem we face in catering for children with disabilities, the problem of falling between two schools.  The health boards do not accept full responsibility and neither does the Minister.  That is acutely obvious in speech therapy, where the health boards have responsibility for appointing speech therapists.  The Minister is determined to establish a school with speech therapy facilities in my constituency, but has not done so because the health board has not appointed a speech therapist. The Minister says he cannot co-ordinate other Departments, but people are not being properly served because he and the Minister for Health and Children are not getting together.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably not relent on this matter, but this is an issue which will have to be revisited on another day.  There will have to be a lead Department to deal with the education of children with special needs, and that should be the Minister's Department.  He should ensure health board services are available to those children so that they can participate fully in education.  The amendment will not be accepted, but this is unfinished business. It is a pity this legislation did not get to grips with it.  The Minister will have to return to the matter of children with special needs falling between two schools.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides for an additional item of responsibility for the Minister in his role of planning and co-ordinating the services of the education system.  The Bill already provides that he plan and co-ordinate the provision of education in recognised schools and of support services. The amendment seeks to add that he also plan and co-ordinate the provision of information on all aspects of the education system.  This was a feature of earlier drafts of the Bill which recognised that providing information and promoting debate about the education system was an important part of developing new legislation. However, this appeared to be forgotten when the idea of regional boards was dropped because it was delegated specifically to them and the Minister would only furrow his brow at the thought of reintroducing them.</P>
      <P>I have not been idle over the summer and have been studying the Department and its activities.  I am amazed at the huge lack of serious information about critical areas of the education system. For example, nothing is known of the drop out rates of third level colleges.  School attendance figures are not regularly returned and the Department knows nothing about the level of school attendance on any systematic basis.  The last national survey dated back to 1984.  There have been spot surveys since but the Department does not conduct any regular surveys about school attendance.  The Department does not require the suspension of pupils to be reported to it with the result that the Minister cannot answer a question on suspensions or expulsions in schools, a normal question which would be asked. The Minister does not plan or co-ordinate the collection of such information or the systematic testing of literacy in schools.  One of the basic facts we would wish to know about the performance of the education system is whether children within it are achieving benchmarks of literacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were expressions of shock when the Education Research Centre found that 17 per cent of 16 to 25 year olds were at the lowest level <Col N="968" /> of literacy and that the corresponding figure for the larger adult population was 25 per cent.  These statistics came as a surprise to commentators.  It begs the question as to why information about crucial issues such as drop out rates, suspensions, literacy and record cards is not available.  I remember it was part of legislation at the time that record cards were to be maintained in primary schools when the primary certificate was abolished.  It is part of legislation that school attendance records be returned to the Department which would maintain overall records. These have fallen into disuse and the Department seems not to see itself as having a serious role in collecting information and promoting debate about the education system.  It is more concerned about crisis management rather than systematically gathering information, which is the bread and butter of serious analysis of education issues.</P>
    <P>I do not table this amendment merely to add something to the Bill which is not already there. A lack of systematic thinking and insufficient collection of information about important areas within the education system are serious weaknesses in the Minister's Department.  Even in areas where legislation provides for it &mdash; the Minister is statutorily required to collate information on school attendance &mdash; it has been allowed to fall into disuse.  That is not good.  I hope the Minister looks on the amendment as giving him the opportunity to organise more systematic collection and analysis of information because that is how he will ensure value for money during his stewardship of the Department. I hope the amendment commends itself to the House.  It is in sympathy with many of the debates we have had and I hope it is accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this amendment tabled by Deputy Bruton which seeks to add another function to those the Minister already has.  It has not been tabled just for the sake of it. It underlines a serious deficit in the Department of Education and Science.  Since I became the Labour Party spokesman on education last December, I have repeatedly raised the issue of the Department not being informed of expulsions, suspensions or of a student being refused entry to a school for reasons other than lack of accommodation.  It is mind-boggling that there is an accepted figure of 800 to 1,000 students who do not make the transition from primary to secondary school each year.  The Minister also knows that some children are expelled from second level schools before reaching the age of 15 without adequate arrangements being made for their education. There are problems but it is as if the Department believes that, if it does not know about them, they do not exist.  However, they do exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that there are easy methods for reporting matters such as expulsions, suspensions and refusal to accept children into a school which are not used.  If the onus were put on a board of management to send a copy of a <Col N="969" /> letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science detailing a child's expulsion from the relevant school, it would be an easy way of dealing with the problem and it would provide the Department with an early signal of the difficulties arising in a student's career. Rollover suspensions are effectively expulsions under another name.  When a child has been suspended from school for more than five days, the Department and the parents of the child should be informed by a letter outlining the suspension imposed.  This should also be the case where parents seek to have their child admitted to a school and are refused.  If this system were introduced, it would take much of the weight off the appeals system which is part of the Bill and which will be debated later.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed by the number of parents contacting me indicating that their children have dyslexia, dyspraxia or attention deficit syndrome.  I have encountered situations where parents on low incomes must pay for their children to be tested for, and sometimes diagnosed with, such difficulties.  I am not going to start a debate on the school psychological service, an issue about which I feel very strongly.  However, there are many parents who are very upset and concerned at having to have their children privately tested for and diagnosed with the various disorders I have mentioned.  While the parents have such information, schools do not and less still the Department.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a system whereby children are tested on a more widespread basis.  The Minister has made reasonable progress on expanding the primary school psychological service and he intends to expand it further.  However, there is an enormous need to have these children assessed at an early stage.  There should be an emergency programme if the Department cannot provide people to carry out these tests in the short-term. I do not say this lightly but I am alarmed by some of the information I am receiving.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson on Education I have been amazed at the lack of information obtainable from the Department.  I can recall tabling questions seeking an overview on certain areas, only to receive replies that the information being sought was not readily available and that the staff input into compiling such information could not be justified.  One wonders if the Department has ever heard of the computer or a database.</P>
    <P>We are agreed that there is a serious problem with information systems.  There is insufficient information in the Department on issues such as children at risk and early school leavers.  Those who suffer are the children and the parents of children who are not making progress in the education system.</P>
    <P>We need to improve information systems.  The Minister has resisted the idea of a definition of the functions of the chief inspector.  He seems to think that he can joke with his officials when Members are contributing.  He was doing likewise last week.  This is a serious issue.  His frivolous <Col N="970" /> attitude in getting the Bill through without listening to points made by Deputies is not good enough.  I would ask him to show a little more respect for the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did cast my eyes to Heaven as the Deputy spoke.  However, he is rehashing everything we deliberated upon on Second Stage. I have taken note of what I consider the serious points he has made.  However, we are bringing Report Stage into disrepute if we have a Second Stage debate on every amendment.  That shows no respect for the House either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has his view.  My view is that we are debating an important amendment which focuses on a serious deficiency in the Department.  I hoped I was making helpful suggestions and supporting this amendment.  If the Minister wishes to treat our contributions in a frivolous manner that is fair enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not fair.  I am not being frivolous.  There should also be some humanity in the House.  We can make the odd flippant comment and the Deputy should not comment in such a manner.  The same happened on Committee Stage.  Members look around and talk to one another.  It is unworthy of the Deputy to make a big deal of such behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister's pomposity. However, I stand by my comments on the lack of respect he is showing for the House.  We can differ on this as on other issues.  The Minister has not commented satisfactorily on whether he misled the House.  However, I do not wish to return to that issue.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the role of the chief inspector with clearly defined functions.  Part of those functions relates to the collection of the information of which I have spoken.  The Minister should look upon this suggestion more sympathetically when we come to the latter stages of the debate on this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister is receiving the same kind of representations I am receiving, but I am becoming alarmed at the number of people offering diagnoses of the various conditions I described.  This is no laughing matter.  There does not appear to be any estimate in the Department of how many pupils suffer from these conditions which require a specialised approach.  I support this amendment to which the Minister should agree.  He may wish to expand on it at a later stage of the Bill.  However, it is fundamental to the Bill that the functions of the chief inspector be agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any suggestion that I am treating this Bill in a frivolous manner.  That is an unfair allegation.  I have given much time to this Bill and the Opposition amendments, particularly on Committee Stage which was very long.  On Committee Stage I accepted quite a number of <Col N="971" /> amendments and we spent some time discussing a range of issues.  Even as the Deputies were speaking I took notes to help me respond.  Some of the points made are of interest and are important.  However, many of the issues raised are not relevant to this amendment.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the provision of information on all aspects of the education system. The Deputy's contributions relate more to research and compiling information.  This amendment would not deal with many of the issues referred to by Deputy Bruton.  One cannot provide information that one does not have.  The key point is that we establish systems which provide the Department with greater information on what is happening.  I inherited the deficiencies referred to by the Deputies.  Deputy O'Shea's party had responsibility for the Department of Education for the past four years.  Everything he has said concerning deficiencies of data systems is an indictment of those four years.</P>
      <P>I have made it a priority to ensure that we utilise the IT section of the Department which is doing very good work on collecting data and marrying it with other sections in the Department to provide a good database.  Last August, I initiated the first research in the Department on early school leavers and retention figures in second level schools.  No such research was undertaken in the past four years.  How can we intervene if we do not have the data?  That exercise has been completed and we have good data on the difficulties in retention.  We can pinpoint areas where difficulties arise in achieving the retention figures we would like schools to achieve.  Some of this information will be confidential as we do not want to further disadvantage certain areas and schools by subjecting them to unwarranted publicity. However, we can direct the respective authorities to devise programmes to try to improve retention rates.</P>
      <P>Research was commissioned by the points commission on attrition rates at third level referred to by Deputy Bruton.  By their nature, third level institutions are autonomous so the Department cannot force them to take certain measures.  We have provided the funding for the points commission to undertake significant research.  Recent details indicated a 23 per cent attrition rate among a certain cohort of first year university students.  I have sought more expansive and comprehensive research in that area, even though some of the university authorities considered it was not feasible.  I do not accept that view and I have pushed strongly for more comprehensive research on attrition rates for full time under graduates at universities and at institutes of technology. The amendment does not address those issues.  These are policy issues which depend on the degree to which a Minister of the day will prioritise data collection and data systems which are necessary to inform policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of suspension and expulsion of pupils the database in primary schools is poor. <Col N="972" /> That is an historic deficiency.  It did not commence during my term.  I am determined to ensure by the time I leave office there will be a comprehensive database for primary schools and that they will have the necessary technology to make returns to the Department.  In the context of an initiative with regard to 8-15 year olds we are developing a pilot model to develop a good tracking system for children who leave school early.  The heads of the School Attendance Bill, which came to Cabinet in recent weeks, will impose specific obligations in respect of suspensions, expulsions and the duty to report to the relevant authority.  Issues pertaining to children who have been suspended or expelled will be dealt with in the context of the School Attendance Bill.</P>
    <P>We are undertaking considerable research in the special needs area and are endeavouring to collect a suitable database.  When I came to office I discovered there was not a comprehensive database and that we depended on individual schools to return information.  It is wrong to blame the Department and its officials who are working under much pressure.  It is a matter of prioritising an issue.  I place a high priority on the collection of data which ultimately is important in framing policy.  We have regular sessions in the Department with officials and statisticians, with a view to procuring hard information, going through a whole range of statistics on leaving certificate examinations, performances at ordinary level and so on.  A great deal of data has been collected which can help us frame policy for the future and take corrective steps to enable us meet the objectives of our education policy.  Much work is being done in the Department and it is wrong to criticise it because of the failure of the political system to prioritise this issue in the past.</P>
    <P>On the question of international assessment tests of our literacy performance, I have taken steps, as outlined in reply to a Private Notice Question in the last session, to ensure we will participate in these tests on a regular basis in the future with other countries.  This will give us a good idea of our performance rating in terms of literacy and numeracy on an international comparative basis.</P>
    <P>In respect of the specific amendment which seeks to insert the following &ldquo;the provision of information on all aspects of the education system&rdquo;, the Department provides a great deal of information through the communications office.  I have criticised the deficiencies I have inherited but I acknowledge there have been great improvements in the information which has come from the Department over the years in many areas, for example, the publications and the data are much more accessible to the public.</P>
    <P>Information from the Department must be treated in the context of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, and the Public Service Management Act.  That relates not only to the Department of Education and Science in terms of its responsibilities <i>vis-à-vis</i> the provision of information <Col N="973" /> but to all other Departments.  My amendment No. 44 provides that the Minister publishes all information relating to the monitoring and assessment of the education system, having regard to the objects provided for in section 6. That addresses some of the elements in Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is useful even if the Minister considers it is not directly related to the amendment.  I maintain it is strongly related to the amendment.  It is unacceptable that the Minister should have to explain that colleges that are almost 100 per cent funded by State money would tell him they do not want to give certain basic information to the person who is ultimately responsible for providing that money.  A legislative provision of this nature would strengthen the Minister's hand in getting information to which he is entitled.  The Minister makes play of the fact that he inherited this situation.  That is a mantra: every Minister inherits a situation but he should try to change whatever he can change during his term of office.  The Minister has indicated he will make changes in the area of special needs information. He is absolutely right.  It is unbelievable that we rely on a single survey in 1993 for most of our information about special needs provision and at the same time talk about cherishing every child equally.  The Minister is taking on a responsibility to ensure every child gets education and when he asks the Department if that is the case, it says it has no idea.  This is an important issue.  I am not trying to blame civil servants but I am underlining to them that statute law already provides that they should collect certain information and maintain it but they are not doing so. Whether that is the responsibility of the political head or the departmental head, the legislation exists.  The Minister is talking about new requirements under the School Attendance Bill when similar requirements, under existing legislation, were not observed.  Let the buck stop where it will but somebody is responsible.</P>
      <P>I will not press the amendment given that the Minister is not willing to take it on board.  It goes to the heart of a weakness which is not only within the Department of Education and Science but in many Government Departments where they do not see their policy making and analytical role as central to their functions.  They get too bogged down in administration they would be better delegating.  I will not delay the House further on this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(d) to ensure that any student who is out of school for an unreasonable length of time <Col N="974" /> shall have an appropriate education provided for them.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This concerns a role and function of the Minister for Education and Science, namely, ensuring a student who is out of school for an unreasonable length of time shall have an appropriate education provided for him.  Statute is quite unclear regarding who has responsibility for ensuring a child is in education when the State says he should be.  This is also relevant to the years following compulsory education.  There seems to be extraordinary difficulty in identifying exactly who has responsibility, something which is aggravated by rolling suspensions in the context of defining a time when a point of finality is reached after which it can be said a child is definitely out of school.  As a result there are many children out of school on a long-term basis for whom proper provision is not being made.</P>
    <P>In the most recent sample survey carried out by the Department it was found that 1.5 per cent of pupils were either expelled or suspended.  This amounts to more than 6,000 pupils, a very significant number of the school going population of 450,000.  There is a vacuum regarding who has responsibility for ensuring pupils are in school. The responsibility should fall on the shoulders of the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say he will assume such responsibility under the School Attendance Bill and that he wishes to defer consideration of the matter until then.  I will reluctantly accept that if it is the case, but I am getting more and more depressed by the delay in publishing the School Attendance Bill.  The Taoiseach makes great play about the wonderful new things which will result from the Bill.  I have been thumbing my last version of the Bill to try to identify where these new frontiers will lie and I must table a question to the Minister on this.  It is universally agreed that this legislation is necessary.  The Conroy Commission recommended change in 1970, but we may still not have a School Attendance Bill as we approach the millennium.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to accept the amendment and have one part of the school attendance legislation in place by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Bruton that it would help the debate if the Minister could give some indication regarding the heads of the School Attendance Bill.  Reading the amendment reminded me that I recently tabled a parliamentary question about a 15 year old special needs student who in September was facing a third school year without education.  I accept this is an extreme case.  However, all Deputies have encountered situations where children have been expelled from second level schools without alternative provision being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this issue will be fully and substantially addressed by the School Attendance Bill when it is finally introduced to the House.  However, in recognition of the enormous problem, there are short-term measures which could be introduced <Col N="975" /> pending the passing into law of that Bill which would assist the Department in getting a measure on the difficulties.</P>
    <P>During the debate on Committee Stage I felt we were being told there is a grey area between the constitutional guarantee of primary education and the legal guarantee of education up to 15 years of age.  To what extent can second level schools expel a child leaving him or her with no place to go?  Those who drop out of school early pose a very large problem which must be urgently addressed.  The Minister would assist the debate if he gave us an outline of the heads of the Bill and explained the extent to which he is prepared to introduce interim measures to address the problem faced by the many students under 15 years of age who have been outside the education system for too long.  Such students on reaching 15 years of age have no effective protection in law, even if they had such up to that age.  It is likely that such students will never return to the education system.</P>
    <P>This is the most serious current problem in education.  Irrespective of the reforms which will be included in the School Attendance Bill, there is an onus to act now.  There is no legal restriction on the Minister preventing him from issuing a directive by way of circular letter to boards of management putting the onus on them to send copies of letters of expulsion, suspension or rejection of application issued to parents to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The School Attendance Bill will deal with the specific point raised.  My legal advice is that we should await publication of that Bill and use the mechanism associated with it to incorporate the principle contained in Deputy Bruton's amendment.  The Education (No. 2) Bill makes specific provision in sections 6 and 7 regarding the obligation of the Minister to provide education for all children.  This obligation does not cease simply because children are not in school.  The Department already provides home tuition and tuition in settings other than the formal school setting for students who are out of school for substantial periods for a variety of reasons, something which will continue following enactment of the legislation.  Section 2 includes education other than in school among the list of support services which the Minister will provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The School Attendance Bill will deal with children who are out of school for an unreasonable length of time for a range of reasons, specifically for expulsions and suspensions.  In this context we are beginning consultations with a number of interests.  The heads of the Bill have been drawn up and it has been sent for detailed drafting.  We are not putting the legislation on the long finger and I am very anxious to push forward with its publication.  Perhaps actions speak louder than words, but I think it is more important that the Bill be properly drafted and published so that it <Col N="976" /> can be discussed in the House.  The point raised in the Deputy's amendment will be dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister will definitely take responsibility in this context as it is a grey area.  On the basis of the Department's survey, the number of pupils who are expelled or on suspension is 12,000 &mdash; earlier I gave an incorrect figure.  If that number were crammed into one year, it would comprise almost one fifth of the student cohort and leave a high number of children in limbo.  I regret the Minister is not including some of the outlined measures in this Bill when he can get it through the House quickly but I know he will tackle the issue at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) to publish a charter of the educational and support services which a parent or pupil is entitled to receive, which would include a statement of the channels of complaint open to a person in respect of these services.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister more or less suggested that a picture would emerge from the myriad sections of the Bill in regard to a parent's or pupil's entitlements.  If one is sufficiently diligent and industrious, it is probably possible to ferret out such entitlements.</P>
      <P>The notion of a Minister providing a charter of education and support services is a good one; one of the Minister's predecessors introduced a charter in respect of the health services which, though failing to provide all the answers, was viewed as a positive step.  The notion of having a charter of education and support services which could be displayed in schools throughout the country in the same manner as the charter for health services is displayed in clinics and hospitals is a good one and would help to promote the new spirit the Minister hopes the Bill will introduce into our education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced the publication of a charter would be a particularly good thing. <Col N="977" /> In essence, the Bill is a charter but one which has a statutory base in terms of the rights of children and parents.  It also provides for avenues of redress and puts parents' and children's rights on a statutory footing for the first time.  Such rights were previously dependent on departmental circulars which did not constitute statutory underpinning.</P>
      <P>The Bill is quite unusual in terms of its broad nature and the manner in which it sets out the objectives of the education system.  It is relatively easy to compile and publish a charter but one could be accused of being disingenuous if the achievement of its provisions did not prove realistic.  There was a time when charters were all the rage but essentially people want improved services, resources and facilities.  It is far more important to increase capital funding to schools by 40 per cent than publish a meaningless charter. I accept a charter might present some benefits in identifying objectives and so on, but the Bill is much stronger than a charter as it has teeth in terms of people's rights.  I accept the bona fides of the Deputy's motivation in tabling the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the inclusion of various measures in a charter could be perceived as being disingenuous in so far as their delivery might not prove achievable within a particular timescale.  However, he missed an important point.  We, as elected representatives, have a certain familiarity with the education system although there is a great deal we have yet to learn about it but many people do not have such familiarity.  In recent days, a constituent of mine visited me in tears because of representations made to the Department to which no follow-up was received.</P>
      <P>To an extent, a charter is made up of jargon. However, it would be beneficial if parents and students were made aware of their rights under this legislation and of the channels of redress open to them if services are not provided.  We should not underestimate the fact that some parents and students feel alienated by the system. The dissemination of information and increased familiarity with the education system would assist us in redressing such difficulties.  A charter would cultivate a sense of inclusiveness; it would spell out people's entitlements and let them know their place in the system.  I cannot see the logic in having complicated legislation such as this and not informing consumers about its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information empowers people to act on their own behalf.  If people were better informed, they would become more involved in the education system although some initial strains would be experienced.  A charter would not convey false impressions.  If we pass legislation which confers rights on citizens, there cannot be any contradiction in including those rights in a single document to which people would have ready access.  I would be happy if the Minister undertook to publish an appropriate document targeted at parents when <Col N="978" /> this Bill is passed.  It is nonsense to pass legislation if we do not tell the people what we have done.  There has been no overwhelming newspaper coverage of this.  I told a meeting I attended recently, at which many parents were present, that I am appalled at the lack of interest in this legislation among parents.  My concern is that we should make every possible effort to let people know what we are doing when we enact legislation on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Some of the concepts in this legislation are quite intricate.  My main criticism of this it is that it puts into statute law the <i>status quo</i> which is quite complicated, having developed in a certain historical way.  To be relevant, the Oireachtas has to be inclusive.  There is a worrying trend whereby people, particularly young people, are not exercising their franchise.  We have to be relevant, and be seen to be doing things here that impact in a positive way on people's lives.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister accept this amendment?  I have been critical of the Department.  There is a whole plethora of departmental publications, but one would have to be a professional, an insider in the system, to understand any of them.  We have to become much more consumer friendly in terms of communication.  We have to address the electorate at large.  We have spent much time debating this Bill, and the Minister is critical of that to some extent.</P>

      <P>On a more serious note, symbols are extraordinarily important in any walk of life.  I would be happy if, after this Bill is passed, a document were put on the wall of every school telling people they have a right of appeal if they are not happy with certain things, that the Minister has given a statutory undertaking that the educational needs of all students, including those with special needs will be identified and provided for, and that parents are entitled to have democratically elected representatives on the school board.

      <P>In page 10, line 34, to delete &ldquo;with&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;who have a disability or who have other&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The aim of amendments Nos. 42 and 64 is to clarify that the provisions apply both to students with disabilities and to those with special education needs.  Although this was implicit in the Bill as originally drafted, I am happy to clarify it through the amendments in light of concerns raised on Committee Stage so that there will be no ambiguity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the amendment but I again point out the somewhat curious tautology. When one tries to find out what special education needs mean we find that it includes those who have a disability and exceptionally able students. This brings us back to Deputy O'Shea's point that they are two ends of the spectrum and that we should encompass many others who would not regard themselves as having a disability in the conventional sense or who would not regard themselves as being especially able but who, nonetheless, <Col N="980" /> have special needs.  However, I will not reopen that debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a bigger difficulty with it.  I will not read again the definition in the Special Education Review Committee report.  However, we should recommit this issue and I will give an absolute assurance that neither I nor the Labour Party will seek to exploit that in any way.  The terminology is quite confused and somewhat contradictory. The fundamental point remains, that the special education needs definition in the interpretation section deals with students with a disability and gifted students.  In the legislation we are including disability and special education needs although the term &ldquo;special education needs&rdquo; already embraces the group of students that have a disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should recall what happened on Committee Stage and all the consultations which took place, when people wanted to make doubly sure that the term &ldquo;special needs&rdquo; included people with disabilities.  We met many groups representing the entire spectrum of the disability lobby before Committee Stage and they made the point that they wanted that assurance.  I think the Deputy might have wanted a similar assurance on Committee Stage.  To make absolutely sure there was no ambiguity or difficulty, we decided to draft amendments to copperfasten the situation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the wider issue of the definition of disability, it followed comprehensive and exhaustive consultation with all the relevant parties with inputs into the consultation process, specifically in the area of disabilities.  The Bill was framed in that context.</P>
      <P>The decision was taken, following representations made by a number of the partners about educational disadvantage deriving from socio-economic disadvantage, to establish <i>via</i> the Bill an education committee for disadvantage which would give a clear focus to the issue of educational disadvantage outside the special needs area.  That is the background to the decisions which were taken to insert both those sections in that manner in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's explanation and am not seeking to score points at this stage. However, a student with a disability could have a physical or sensory disability which might not necessarily be a learning disability.  Every Member has similar intentions.  It should be possible to recommit the Bill with an agreed formula because the amendment is quite sloppy as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from memory, but I think the Deputy called for us to table this amendment inserting this definition.  I think the Deputy had tabled amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did table amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I responded to that by tabling these amendments but now the Deputy wants us to go around the circle again.  The Bill is not sloppy in this respect.  The definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is quite an important one which will enable us to make significant progress and confers important statutory rights on children with disabilities, which is important in the context of education.</P>
      <P>We can see how matters evolve.  The Bill must go to the Seanad after it leaves this House and the Deputy can discuss the matter further with us if he wishes.  However, we are in danger of forgetting what happened on Committee Stage.  The purpose of Report Stage is to advance the discussions we had on Committee Stage &mdash; hence the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept we must look at how the Bill emerges from Committee Stage and if we are not satisfied with that we have the option to return to it.  However, this is an area of fundamental importance in the Bill and leaving this apparent contradiction in it would not do a service to those who send us here to legislate.  There should be further consultation during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad in a spirit of goodwill and co-operation, which is how I see this issue.</P>
      <P>I have a separate agenda in terms of the definition of &ldquo;special needs&rdquo;, which I strongly believe should include pupils who are educationally disadvantaged and have special needs arising from environmental or social factors.  However, the double entry of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in the Bill should be tidied up as it does not add anything to the legislation but weakens it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

People outside the House were saying we were trying to dilute this, that and the other and I said that was not our intention.  To prove <Col N="982" /> the bona fides of our motivation we responded to the Deputy's amendments by tabling this amendment. The position which the Deputy has just articulated was my starting position on Committee Stage.  To be helpful, I tabled this amendment. I will go around again if the Deputy wishes.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied our definition of &ldquo;special needs&rdquo; is adequate but it is important in a Bill such as this to allay people's doubts about it and to assure them that the State is committed to providing the constitutional rights of a child with a disability to an education.  We decided to go down this route to allay the doubts which existed.  It does not damage the legislation nor will it reduce the capacity of the State, the Minister or the Department to meet the obligations the Bill will impose on them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 49, to delete &ldquo;which requests such provision&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This also relates to section 7, which concerns the Minister's functions.  Section 7(2)(d) provides that one such function is to provide support services through Irish to recognised schools which provide teaching through Irish and to any other recognised school which requests such provision.  My amendment seeks to delete the last four words.</P>
      <P>Since Committee Stage, a number of points have been made to me about support services for the Irish language and there are later amendments in that regard.  We should not have too narrow a focus on support services through Irish to recognised schools or to any schools, because it is vital that we provide the best level of support services in Irish to all schools.  We have seen the phenomenon of the growth of Gaelscoileanna but Gaeltacht schools have had a number of problems. I was recently informed by the principal of such a school that he has received students who spoke neither Irish nor English but a European language, because some non-nationals have set up home in Gaeltacht areas.  Deleting the words &ldquo;which requests such provision&rdquo; would make clear that the provisions mentioned here are available to every school, not only to those which request them.</P>
      <P>A great deal of resources have been put into teaching Irish since the foundation of the State. Schools were given responsibility for teaching the language but the environment outside the schools was often not supportive of Irish, and whereas a great deal of good work was done within the schools it was often not possible to converse in Irish outside.  The work being done did not, therefore, have its optimum effect.</P>
      <P>There should be a serious national debate about why it is both important and appropriate that we retain the Irish language.  We should make it our objective to achieve a bilingual society and in many ways the language makes it easier for us to understand who and what we are and how the country developed.  For instance, something as simple as logainmneacha can give us a picture of how an area grew up.  I could give many instances of that, it is a hobby horse of mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Phrases like &ldquo;which request such provision&rdquo; have a restrictive air.  The Minister may argue about resources, which are always a consideration, <Col N="984" /> but we should give a clear signal about the language.  Is the Department doing research into or has it a policy on the place of Irish outside the schools, so that the language taught in the schools can move into a living environment where it can prosper?  Everything done by the schools is fine, and standards are achieved, but the population needs to be convinced &mdash; as I think it will be &mdash; of the necessity and appropriateness of reviving the language to the optimum degree and how that adds to our Irishness.  It is now part of European culture and is something specific which we have to offer.</P>
    <P>I want to delete this wording because it is unnecessarily negative and may exclude the 95 per cent of schools which do not teach through the medium of Irish and are not located in Gaeltacht areas.  I am all in favour of áiseanna and essential help for Gaelscoileanna and scoileanna Gaeltachta, but there is a danger that we might forget the needs of the 95 per cent of schools and thus would do no service to the wider aim of the restoration of Irish as a spoken language on a much wider scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not read the section in the same light as Deputy O'Shea &mdash; I saw it as giving schools the option of having their affairs dealt with through the medium of Irish, and under that interpretation the qualification in the clause seems reasonable.  There is some confusion, however, about how the Minister proposes to relate to schools which teach through Irish and those which do not &mdash; he seems to be proposing to set up a body of persons who would provide support services only to schools which teach exclusively through Irish and not to those which teach Irish as a subject.  We may return to this issue when discussing the amendments to section 31.  The debate on the role of that body has waxed and waned and perhaps the Minister could shed light on his present thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My thinking on that issue is that the section applies to schools which teach through the medium of Irish.  That proposal arose from representations made consistently down the years by Gaelscoileanna and scoileanna na Gaeltachta about the lack of resources specifically for schools teaching through Irish, including in-service training, teacher training and curriculum resources. For example, if a school wished to teach science or maths through Irish it would not have the same resources in Irish as exist in English in terms of publications, etc.  It was felt there was a need for a resource base and a body to organise and co-ordinate the provision of resources specific to the needs of schools teaching through the medium of Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment, if accepted, would place an obligation on the Department to provide all the support services through Irish listed in the section to all schools even if they did not request it, which I think would be excessively onerous.  Those services include transport, library and media services, <Col N="985" /> school maintenance, examinations, curriculum support, provision for student learning, primary, post-primary and continuing education for students with special needs.  Literally everything from the Department would be sent in Irish even if the school did not want it if this amendment was passed.  For example, there are 11 volumes in the new primary school curriculum relating to each subject.  If the school does not teach through the medium of Irish, it will not necessarily want the maths or geography sections in Irish.  We will publish an Irish version of the new primary school curriculum but we must be a little realistic in terms of the obligations we are placing on the Department.  Why send a great deal of material to schools which do not want it and which would put it in a cupboard or in the bin if they received it?  That would be an unnecessary waste of resources.  The Bill is reasonable and the phrase &ldquo;to any other recognised school which requests such a provision&rdquo; is not designed to be restrictive.  If the school requests the materials, they will be provided.</P>

I know that is far from the Minister's intention. Those views have been expressed to me by people whose views I value.

      <P>&ldquo;(b) shall recognise the important input of patrons, parents, students, education managements, teachers and other staff as well as the wider community, who together represent the educational partners, at both national and local level and shall endeavour to ensure that they shall be consulted in all areas where they have a direct concern by persons concerned with the implementation of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arose from the discussion on Committee Stage.  Essentially, the amendment seeks to give some type of definition to the education partners.

I explicitly included the wider community as an education partner in that it does not solely refer to students, their parents and teachers.  There is a wider community interest in education and any definition of education partners should embrace that wider community.</P>
      <P>This amendment also seeks to place an obligation or an expectation on anyone concerned with the implementation of this Act, whether at national or local level, to consult in areas where persons have a direct concern with various members of the partnership.  This matter was discussed on Committee Stage and the Minister expressed some sympathy with the idea of recognising the right of consultation not only at national level as and when the Minister decides. He acknowledged that there was a legitimate expectation that there will be consultation at local level when decisions are taken which would materially affect a group of parents or pupils or the wider community.  This was discussed on Committee Stage but was not finalised.  I thought the Minister would introduce some concept of this matter in a Report Stage amendment.</P>

      <P>I will listen to what the Minister has to say when he addresses his amendment.  We need to push the notion of partnership.  Decisions arise at times which have a significant impact on a community and there is a legitimate expectation that the community would have the opportunity to consult and not necessarily only with the Minister. However, with the abolition of regional boards which I am sure Deputy O'Shea will point out, the Minister stands in the breach for almost everything because there is no delegation of authority to local level.  There is an expectation of consultation at local level and that is why the amendment was tabled.  I await with interest the Minister's and Deputy O'Shea's contribution on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is very broad in terms of the obligations it would place on any Minister with regard to consultation.  One of the issues raised on Committee Stage was the desirability of the Minister to consult at local level. Amendment No. 52 attempts to address that issue and it meets Deputy O'Shea's amendments Nos. 51 and 56 in terms of inserting &ldquo;local&rdquo; after &ldquo;national&rdquo; in amendment No. 51 and &ldquo;parents' associations in schools&rdquo; after &ldquo;parents,&rdquo; in amendment No. 52.  The issue raised on Committee Stage was that if we consult only with national parents' associations, certain local parents' associations may not have their voices heard or may be squeezed out and there could be disputes between a parents' association and the national bodies and that we should include a provision which would facilitate the Minister in consulting with local parents' associations.  I intend to meet that concern in amendment No. 52.  I do not accept Deputy Sargent's amendment No. 54.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have difficulty accepting amendment No. 53 and I articulated the reason on Committee Stage. It is not practical to place a statutory obligation on the Minister to consult with students as proposed in amendment No. 53.  What mechanisms would one put forward to facilitate such consultation with second level students?  We do not have student or representative bodies at second level.  In an historic step section 27 provides for specific liaison with students in an individual school setting.  We consult widely.  A Minister should consult local communities depending on the circumstances that arise from time to time, but it is undesirable to place a broad sweeping statutory obligation on him or her which could lead to many practical implementation difficulties in terms of decision making in the future.  I am satisfied the Bill is progressive in terms of the <Col N="988" /> consultative process outlined in it, particularly with the partners in education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued throughout the debate on this Bill that the implementation of education policy at regional or local level should be in the hands of a local or regional authority on the basis that devolution of education from Marlborough Street is desirable and very much in the interests of delivering a more streamlined product to the various students.  I have no difficulty with the essence of Deputy Bruton's argument. He does not go down the road of particular models such as local or regional authorities.</P>
      <P>The amendment is not effectively formalised but I support the essence of what is being sought and see a great deal of merit in it.  The Minister is including parents' associations and schools and that gets us over the difficulty in regard to local consultation.  I am happy to withdraw my amendment in favour of his.  I have strong views on consultation with organisations which represent the disabled but he has not sought to add them to his list of bodies which should be consulted under the terms of his functions.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 56 seeks to delete the term &ldquo;special education needs as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.  This refers to groups of persons who have a special interest in or experience of the education of students with special education needs.  The reason I am seeking to remove that is that the people he described could be from the Department, for instance.  That is not a reflection on them, but there are aspects of disabilities which only those who have them fully understand. I am primarily talking about physical and sensory disabilities.  That type of consultation is necessary in this regard.</P>
      <P>Consultation with groups of persons which have a special interest in or experience of the education of students is too narrow.  Education is one aspect of consultation and the support of people participating in education is another issue that should be addressed in all the various consultations in which the Minister is involved.</P>

I accept the Minister's point.  There is a possibility of better drafting.  My basic concern is that the various support groups for people with a range of disabilities get a clear message that their input and comment is welcome in the consultation process.

      <P>Local educational issues should not get lost, whatever is peculiar to particular areas.  It is against that background I am seeking an amendment.  There probably is not a great deal between the three of us in this regard.  Consultation should be formalised through regional or local authorities which include people representing various areas with the clout and ability to make decisions.  I welcome the changes in terms of parents' associations and schools, but I am not satisfied that the formula used is sufficiently inclusive.  We are not dealing with something that is mandatory.  Nobody will come back and say that the Minister did not consult with X or Y. All organisations should be welcomed and facilitated in making their views known.  That is all this section will amount to at the end of the day.  It does not impose mandatory obligations on the Minister regarding consultation.  It just seeks in umbrella fashion, to include the various areas that are part of the communitywide partnership in education.</P>

If the Deputy is anxious that we should include the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; in respect of those representing children with special needs, I will consider that before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  I cannot accept amendment No. 56 as worded because it would be a meaningless paragraph and would not gel with the language in the Bill.  I am anxious to ensure people have access to the Department, that consultation is two-way and not exclusive at all times to national bodies.  I will try to work that into the Bill, particularly in the context of children with special needs.  We are already doing that.  I have met groups representing children with special needs and local bodies throughout the country.  I do not see any difficulty in reflecting that in the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) shall appoint an Appeals Committee to investigate complaints of persons directly affected regarding the provision of education or support services, and report thereon to the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall this matter generated a degree of heat on Committee Stage because many of us were incensed at the Minister of State's description of the National Parents Council as looking for a charter for busy bodies.  He accused it of carrying out a blinkered campaign of opposition to the education Bill.  That was in the context of the National Parents Council expressing legitimate concerns that the extent to which the right of appeal would be afforded to parents under the Bill is restricted.  Deputy O'Shea tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  This amendment goes a significant way towards correcting a deficiency in the Bill.  The Bill primarily provides for rights of appeal for parents in respect of issues within the school, but it restricts them to matters such as suspensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister is taking on responsibilities in regard to parents and children, it is important that parents have an opportunity to make complaints. That is what these amendments seek to achieve.  In other words, parents should have a right to question whether the Minister has ensured the educational needs of their children have been identified and provided for.  That is a fundamental issue.  When the Minister was on this side of the House he never tired of telling us it was unfair that parents had to go to court to establish their rights in regard to educational provision. If he does not accede to this type of amendment, he will maintain that position in respect of the new responsibilities he has made explicit in this Bill.  Parents will want to challenge whether the educational needs of their children have been properly provided for.  The right of a <Col N="991" /> citizen before the bar of the education system must be properly asserted.  That is an important principle.  The Minister will have statutory duties following the passage of this Bill and people who feel he is not delivering on them should not be forced to go to court to contest their entitlements. An appeals committee that could handle these matters in a non-legalistic way would be the best course of action.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said the Ombudsman's Act was a perfect vehicle for parents who wished to raise this type of issue, but it is not equipped to deal with whether proper services are being provided for children with special needs.  There is a need for an appeals committee that would be informal in relation to its remit as is the case in regard to the Ombudsman's remit, which primarily relates to maladministration rather than the provision of services.  Under existing legislation the Ombudsman cannot question policies a Minister may put in place in relation to provisions.  This Bill goes further because it sets out the statutory rights of parents on which the Minister is obliged to deliver.  This is an important issue.  Deputy O'Shea tabled a similar amendment on Committee Stage and argued articulately in favour of this matter.  I was pleased to table a similar amendment on Report Stage because it underlines important principles related to this Bill.  I am sure this debate will not generate the same heat as the previous debate when the comments of Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, were fresh in our minds and we had the cuttings in our hands.  I hope in the meantime the Minister has reflected on this and has seen the wisdom of the approach advocated by this side of the House.  I look forward to the inclusion of this provision in the Bill because it would be an important improvement that would be accepted by all Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton dealt with some of the points I intended to raise.  I am alarmed at the number of parents of children with special needs who believe there is inadequate educational provision for their children.  I have heard of many more children suffering from dyslexia, dyspraxia and attention deficit syndrome than heretofore. Parents may contact their local Deputy or councillor or write to the Minister in this regard, but I know from my experience of writing to the Department that an acknowledgment is issued, but it may take some time before a reply is issued. While the reply will give accurate information, it does not always address people's concerns or alleviate the distress they may suffer.  I understand a recent court decision ruled that if six students in a county are diagnosed as autistic a special unit must be provided for them.  Will similar court decisions be made in respect of cases brought by the parents of children who suffer from other conditions?  This is terribly wasteful. The human factor is the most important in terms of the distress caused to parents who must pursue <Col N="992" /> this role.  Another aspect is that parents who have children with similar disabilities are watching other parents go through the process, hoping that they will be successful but, ultimately, feeling alienated.</P>
      <P>Appeals systems are a safety valve and provide for inclusiveness.  Rather than parents corresponding and waiting a long time for a reply, an appeals committee should exist to examine the provision in a particular area.  The use of the word &ldquo;area&rdquo; was debated, but I do not consider that it necessarily involves a geographical area, rather the area of provision.</P>
      <P>Recently we have become much more aware of Asberger's Syndrome where people with autism are high performers, although there is a large deficit in social skills.  I am not an expert in terms of how that can be addressed, but with early diagnosis and proper intervention, the quality of life of people with the syndrome could be improved. In terms of educational disadvantage, the models in Ireland have tended to be geographical. However, disadvantage can appear in many settings and areas and for different reasons.</P>
      <P>If parents or students feel a certain provision should be made in an area and that certain types of education are provided in what appears to be a discriminatory manner in different parts of the country, people should have the opportunity to make an appeal and, more importantly, to get the full picture of what is happening.  They should have the opportunity of being told in a forthright and truthful manner the options available in terms of the provision of the service in the short to medium term or if there is a realistic prospect of the service being provided at all.</P>
      <P>I am not sure what is coming through to the Department in terms of the expanded psychological service.  I am not sure that the same level of the conditions to which I referred earlier is apparent in the assessments carried out by educational psychologists attached to the Department of Education and Science.  However, people who cannot afford it are going to private sources to get a diagnosis and then paying for private tuition to meet the difficulties.</P>
      <P>I am aware of cases where more than one member of a family has been diagnosed with a condition. It appears that the necessary back up is not available from the Department.  I am not criticising the Department, rather describing the position as I find it.  An appeals committee would rapidly link people to the Department in terms of the difficulty and ensure an explanation of how it may be addressed can be provided.  This is an important step forward.  My concern is inclusiveness. Some vehicle or clearing house must be put in place to ensure that people with deep grievances do not spend many years pursuing a particular type of education that is not forthcoming.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Shea's contribution because it focused directly on special needs.  I have considerable sympathy <Col N="993" /> for this area and I am aware of the various categories mentioned by the Deputy, such as dyslexia, Asberger's Syndrome, attention deficit disorder and dyspraxia.  If the Deputy is willing I am interested in exploring the matter in terms of the Department's customer services document under the SMI and the establishment of such a committee in respect of special needs.</P>
      <P>The amendment as phrased is very broad and could be open ended.  I am not sure whether Deputy Bruton's amendment relates to the appeals process in the Bill which deals with specific areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in examining the scenario because an appeals committee in this context could be also useful to the Department. Many of the disputes which arise, for example, with regard to autism, are due to the lack of indigenous research.  There are many different views on the best educational programmes for children with autism.  Some parents have strong views on the method of teaching such children at an early age through the established routes.  An appeals committee, although I am not sure that is the correct title, could help.</P>
      <P>In the context of special needs I am very interested in developing a body that could act as an independent assessment of needs and whether the Department is meeting them.  I am not prepared to incorporate the amendments as they stand in the Bill.  However, I will discuss with the Deputy the prospect of setting up an appeals committee in the context of special needs education.  It could start there because there are many unsatisfactory situations in that area which I inherited and with which I am not happy.  There are historic reasons for the current position but the Deputy's proposal has considerable merit.</P>

A tailor made mechanism is required to deal with the type of grievances which will arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister is courageous and I take off my hat to him.  He started off by saying that schools had responsibility for providing for the children. He made a significant change when he said he recognised that this responsibility could not be shunted down to the schools and it was his responsibility as Minister.  However, the appeal mechanism only relates to school level.  The notion of appeal at this level is important.  While I am encouraged to note that the Minister is like Saul on the road to Damascus and has seen the light, it is not an adequate response to the serious debate on Committee Stage to state that perhaps something will be done afterwards.  This continues to be a serious matter on Report Stage.  I am not willing to withdraw the amendment on a wing and a prayer in the hope that at some stage the Minister may take the view that this is a good thing to do.  This is fundamental to citizens' rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The most pressing matter facing society is the crisis in the housing market.  Despite the Government's response, as set out in the Finance (No. 2) Bill introduced in May, the problem is steadily getting worse.  It is having a devastating effect on the ability of the State to provide decent and affordable accommodation.  Given the ever increasing scale of house prices and the chronic shortage of social housing the Government must think again and devise a more comprehensive response.  Its paper, Action on House Prices, published earlier this year is out of date.  The pathetic outcome of the Celtic tiger is that an entire generation of families cannot satisfy one of the most basic aspirations, the aspiration to purchase a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is shared by all Members.  Politicians at national and local level have to deal with the effects of the crisis in their day to day <Col N="995" /> contact with the public.  Unless dramatic action is taken to provide affordable housing options for those on average incomes the foundations of social partnership and wage constraint which have led to economic success will be threatened. The people who left this country ten years ago will not return if they cannot find a home.  The lack of a skilled and mobile workforce will undermine the prosperity enjoyed in recent times.</P>
    <P>No one underestimates the scale of the problem. If we fail to address it with singleminded determination this House will be seen as an irrelevant talk shop.  It is a political problem and must be seen as such.  This Bill would tip the balance in favour of greater protection for home purchasers. We recognise fully that it is draconian but the measures it contains are required in an overheated market of which the practice of gazumping has become a feature.  The vast majority believe it is wrong that a young couple attempting to purchase a new home can have their dream shattered as a result of malpractice in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>When I launched my proposals I asked a simple question &mdash; when is an agreement an agreement in the property market.  The increase in the number of cases involving gazumping before the courts points to a cynical and flagrant abuse of contract law.  Some shocking cases have come to the public's attention.  The Judiciary has highlighted the lack of a legal remedy.  While it is accepted that gazumping is wrong from a moral and ethical perspective, it is the responsibility of the Oireachtas to ensure it is considered wrong from a legal perspective.  This Bill would make it illegal.</P>
    <P>As a result of hyper-inflation in the housing market, house prices in Dublin have increased by 103 per cent in the past four and a half years.  In 1993 a new home in Dublin cost £60,000.  At the end of the second quarter this year it cost a staggering £122,000.  The average increase in the rest of the country was 73 per cent.  The increase in secondhand house prices in the same period was also unprecedented and the trend is continuing as evidenced by the most recent figures in the housing statistics bulletin published by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in September.  Despite the Government's response to the Bacon report prices increased by an amazing 14 per cent in the second quarter of this year and with the expected reduction in interest rates as a result of the changeover to the euro it is likely they will continue to increase.</P>
    <P>It is within this climate of hyper-inflation that potential purchasers must compete with each other.  Many first time buyers require financial assistance from their parents to enter the marketplace. Two incomes are required.  A single person on the average industrial wage would have to devote 60 per cent of his or her disposable income &mdash; in excess of £13,000 &mdash; to service a mortgage, assuming he or she can pay the 10 per cent deposit.  The effects on young families have <Col N="996" /> yet to be properly analysed.  Because many couples have borrowed beyond their income capacity problems will emerge in relation to child care and their ability to service excessive mortgages should interest rates increase dramatically.</P>
    <P>The difficulties encountered in raising huge amounts of capital to purchase a new home can pale into insignificance when compared to the problems experienced in closing a sale.  There is anecdotal evidence that the practice of gazumping has become a feature of the housing market. The cases which have come to the public's attention and which represent but a fraction of the total highlight the difficulties which can be encountered. This legislation would limit the period in which the contract has to be agreed between the vendor and the purchaser.  Frequently the vendor will decide not to sign the contract despite the payment of a booking deposit.  This time provides the option of attempting to sell the property at a higher price to another purchaser.  Despite repeated efforts on the part of purchasers, through their solicitor, to close the sale of the property, the time lag provides the vendor with the opportunity to hike up the price following more substantial offers from other potential purchasers. It is in this climate of hyper-inflation, which I described earlier, that this problem has become commonplace and needs to be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>A purchaser waiting over three months to close the sale with a vendor is obviously unable to compete for a higher price for such a property three months from giving the vendor a booking deposit. Most people believe this situation to be intolerable and expect the Oireachtas to show some leadership on the issue.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in such an overheated market the problem of gazumping is compounded but we should call a spade a spade and admit that the hyper-inflation in the housing market will not go away.  The current conditions of the housing market require that strong legislative and consumer protection must be in place for purchasers and vendors.</P>
    <P>Buying a house is the most important financial decision in anyone's lifetime.  That decision needs to be underpinned by a code of practice in which vendors and purchasers know and understand their rights and obligations.  In almost all the cases which have come before the courts, it is virtually impossible to get justice for the injured party.  It is time to impose the ultimate sanction on persons who engage in the practice of gazumping. Through the introduction of this legislation, which makes the practice of gazumping a criminal offence and allows the courts to grant compensation to injured parties, the Dáil will send a strong signal to both purchasers and vendors that in the context of the current crisis in the housing market, the practice of gazumping will not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill before the House is to prevent vendors of residential property, who have agreed to sell a property at a certain price and <Col N="997" /> who have received a booking deposit, selling it to another party at an increased price within an unreasonably short time after receipt of a booking deposit.  Fine Gael proposes to make the practice of gazumping a criminal offence punishable by a fine not greater than £5,000 for the first offence and by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months for a second or subsequent offence.</P>
    <P>A feature of this legislation is the power given to the courts to award compensation to a gazumped purchaser of not more than ten times the booking deposit or £10,000, whichever is the greater.  The Bill places a duty on vendors to deliver to purchasers a written contract within 14 days of the receipt of a booking deposit.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline each section of the legislation. Section 1 is the definition section.  The Minister charged with responsibility for making regulations is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The section also outlines the precise meaning of &ldquo;vendor&rdquo; and &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;.  It is important to point out that the legislation covers all residential property, encompassing both new and second-hand property.</P>
    <P>Section 2 requires the vendor to furnish a written contract, with all relevant documentation connected to such a sale, to the purchaser within 14 days of the payment of a booking deposit.  We propose that the Minister would prescribe the precise documentation to be furnished in the contract. Section 3 provides that the vendor shall not enter into any other agreement to sell the property within 14 days of the purchaser receiving the documentation as specified in section 2.  If such an agreement is established it shall be null and void.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that if the purchaser does not sign the contract and return it with the balance of a 10 per cent deposit to the vendor within 14 days of receiving it, the vendor may, after a period of 14 days, resell the property provided the vendor first returns the deposit to the purchaser. Section 5 provides that if the purchaser signs the contract and returns it with the balance of the deposit to the vendor within the period of 14 days, the vendor must sign the contract within seven days of receiving it and if the vendor fails to do so the purchaser may apply to the Circuit or High Court for an order compelling the vendor to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives jurisdiction to the Circuit Court and the High Court but, where the rateable valuation of the property exceeds £500 and the proceedings have been commenced in the Circuit Court, they may be transferred to the High Court on the request of any interested party.</P>
    <P>Section 7 makes it an offence for a vendor to fail to comply with sections 2 or 5 and provides that he or she shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £5,000 and, upon a second or subsequent conviction, to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.  This section also provides for the payment of compensation to a purchaser where a vendor has been <Col N="998" /> convicted of an offence under the Bill.  Section 8 provides that the form of contract to be delivered by the vendor under section 2 shall be in the current Law Society's form, or in such other form as the Minister may prescribe, and shall give the purchaser good marketable title to the property.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers the Minister to make regulations for the effective implementation of the Bill.  Section 10 provides the commencement date &mdash; 28 days after the date of the Bill's enactment. Section 11 contains the short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Central to the effective implementation of the Bill are the requirements outlined in sections 2 and 3 of the proposed legislation.  Under section 2, where a vendor receives a booking deposit from a purchaser, that vendor shall, within 14 days of the payment, deliver to the purchaser a written contract.  In effect, this section means that the documentation surrounding the proposed sale of a property would have to be assembled at or around the time when the vendor would seek to sell the property.  It is important to highlight that where gazumping has occurred to date in the housing market, it related to the length of time in which the vendor had either failed to furnish a contract or had failed to sign the contract.</P>
    <P>By limiting the time involved for the acceptance of the contract and by making it illegal for a vendor to enter into another agreement with another purchaser, the practice of gazumping would disappear overnight.  I note that in countries such as Holland, Sweden, Denmark, France and Portugal it takes an average of four to six weeks to complete house purchases.  If a provision was provided in law for the sale of a property along the lines we suggest in this legislation the length of time required to transact the property would, by definition, have to reduce from the current unacceptable duration of time.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives protection to the vendor.  It provides that, where a purchaser fails to sign the contract and furnish 10 per cent of the purchasing price of the property within two weeks of receiving a contract, the vendor shall be at liberty to resell the property to another purchaser.  Under our proposal the total length of time required for a contract to be signed by both parties would be 34 days &mdash; 14 days to deliver a contract to the purchaser on receipt of a booking deposit, another 14 days for the purchaser to agree the contract with the vendor and seven days for the vendor to sign the contract.</P>
    <P>The proposed five weeks timeframe would obviously lead to changes within conveyancing practice.  An outcome of this legislation, however, would be the gathering together of a greater number of documents surrounding the sale of such property at a much earlier time.  By limiting the time involved, the legislation offers a guarantee to both purchasers and vendors that the sale will be completed without undue delay.</P>
    <P>The real life stories behind the cases of gazumping need to be expressed in the context of this debate.  One such story, involving the case of Mr. Conor Hughes, was recently articulated in <Col N="999" /> the November issue of <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine. In 1996, Mr. Hughes experienced the inadequacies of the law in this area at first hand.  I quote directly from the <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine article in which Mr. Hughes stated:</P>
    <P>I made an offer on a house after viewing it twice.  We agreed on a price, paid a deposit and received a letter of confirmation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Hughes then put his own house up for sale and soon found a buyer, but his plans were thwarted when his solicitor discovered problems with the registration of land belonging to the property he wanted to buy and the deal fell through.  Mr. Hughes said: &ldquo;I think there should be a legal obligation on sellers, auctioneers and solicitors to ensure that the property's legal documents are in order before it is put on the market.&rdquo; Mr. Hughes did not give up and got a second opinion on the case.  Another solicitor said the sale could go ahead and Mr. Hughes drew down his mortgage, organised his insurance and called the buyer of his own home who agreed to go ahead with the sale despite the delay.  However, on the day he was to sign the contract agreed verbally, the seller demanded a further £17,000.  Mr. Hughes refused and the sale fell through once again.  Last November Mr. Hughes said:</P>
    <P>The consumer has no protection in these circumstances. The seller was perhaps within his rights, but should he be allowed to get away with it?</P>
    <P>The fact is that sellers of property will continue to get away with it until more stringent laws are put in place to protect house purchasers.  Mr. Hughes's case is typical of thousands of others in the housing market.  It would be unfair not to recognise that for the vast majority of people in the conveyancing, auctioneering and construction professions, the practice of gazumping, carried out by a small group, is a deep annoyance and embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is support for my Bill from the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers. In a statement of support issued on 23 June the institute said:</P>
    <P>The legal process of signing sale of house contracts should be speeded up as part of an overall strategy to end the practice of gazumping . one of the most immediate issues requiring Government attention is why it takes so long to produce final contracts once the deal has been agreed.</P>
    <P>I welcome a recent call from the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute to tackle gazumping from an alternative legislative route.  Its proposal, which was recently submitted to Government, involves changing the law concerning contracts for house sales by private treaty to prevent gazumping.  The IAVI argues that its proposal would have the effect of giving the purchaser a two week option once the private treaty is issued. <Col N="1000" /> Private treaties represent the majority of contracts in the transaction of new and second-hand property.  Provided a buyer executes the contract without changes and returns within the two week period, the contract would be binding on both purchasers and vendors.  My concern with this proposal is that it fails to address gazumping cases prior to the issuing of contracts, a problem highlighted in some cases where a vendor failed to issue a written contract to the purchaser.  I welcome the two week time limit proposed by the IAVI.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, told the annual convention of the Irish House Builders Association last May that the house building industry had a responsibility to self-regulate its own industry.  He said: &ldquo;If that is not seen to work in the interests of consumers then other options have to be considered.&rdquo; I am interested in knowing the nature of such options being considered by the Minister of State and the Government.  My party's view is that voluntary codes of practice will not achieve their stated objectives, and this view is shared by the Director of Consumer Affairs, Mr. Fagan, who said that the Irish House Builders Association &ldquo;really has no form of enforcing discipline.&rdquo; He suggested stronger measures may be necessary, including statutory penalties for builders who cannot justify a price increase made after making a deposit.</P>
    <P>There is now a consensus in the gazumping debate on providing a legislative response to this problem.  That response must have clear penalties for vendors who engage in such practices.  Put bluntly, the Government's response to the problem, as seen in its proposal for a voluntary code of practice, will not stamp out the existence of gazumping in the Irish housing market.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government changes its position on this issue during this debate.  Fine Gael does not claim to have all the answers to this problem, but the Home Purchasers (Anti-Gazumping) Bill, with appropriate amendment on Committee Stage if the House thinks it necessary, provides the most obvious formula to make the practice of gazumping unlawful.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Hayes on this Bill and on his work since being appointed junior spokesman on housing.  I hope the Government accepts this Bill as a step in the right direction.  If changes on Committee Stage are necessary, this side of the House would be agreeable to that, as Deputy Hayes said.</P>
      <P>I bought a site in Westport town in 1977, when I was a young man and recently married.  The cost was to be £1,100.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan.  A businessman in Westport owned the site and sold <Col N="1001" /> it on to an Englishman within a week, though I had agreed the sale of the site.  I had planning permission and was ready to start my house.  The businessman rang me on a Friday evening to tell me that he would not be going ahead with the sale of the site as he had sold it to an Englishman, Mr. Stevenson.  He told me to contact Mr. Stevenson as he might sell the site to me.  I met Mr. Stevenson the following Tuesday and he told me he would sell the site for £2,300, which was a lot of money in 1977.  It was where I lived, I had the plans for my house ready and my wife wanted to live there.  I had to make a decision, and I bought the site for £2,300.  However, I had to put off building the house for about ten months because I could not afford to start it.  I never forgave that man in Westport nor the Englishman for buying the site.  If I had the money at the time I would have bought the whole area.  I am still there 20 years later while the Englishman is gone, though he made some money before leaving, as well as causing problems that had to be solved by the local community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hayes pointed out that we have a serious housing crisis.  When a young man and woman get married, the first thing they want is to buy a house or site.  I speak with two hats: as an auctioneer and as a politician.  Any politician worth his salt who deals with people on a regular basis is told that housing is the biggest problem people are now facing.  Some 60 people attended my clinic in Westport yesterday, and 30 per cent of them were looking for council houses.  Of that number, 25 per cent would buy their own sites or houses if they had the opportunity.  However, house and site prices are out of their reach and they are dependent on the local authority.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a situation where, if I were selling Deputy Hayes's house, I could give him a valuation for his house and if he were satisfied with that valuation the price could be put in a brochure.  The person who reaches that price first should be the owner of the house.  However, people ask auctioneers to sell their houses and when given a valuation they say: &ldquo;We will talk about this at a later stage.  See what offers come in.&rdquo; The offers come in and they increase the price of the house.  Auctioneers are expected to obtain the best price for the people on whose behalf they are selling the house.  Many people have come to my auction business with their finance arranged with the banks and ready to buy a house.  I have been delighted on many occasions to say I could sell them a house only for the seller to ask for £10,000 more the following day.  That is not on and we in this Parliament should protect the consumer.  It is wrong for builders and other individuals who, when the valuation is given to them, believe there is more to be had.  It is very unfair on young couples and on society in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Something must be done to allow more people access to the housing market.  Since the Government came into office, it has done nothing except make the rich richer and the <Col N="1002" /> middle class and poor poorer.  Whatever chance people had of buying a house three or four years ago, they have had no chance with the past three or four budgets.  I speak against the Government of which my party was a member when I say that.  There was a pilot scheme in Westport which was the greatest disaster ever in the town.  Young couples born and reared in Westport must now live elsewhere while people from Cork, Dublin and New York live in the town and own three or four houses.  All the while, the poor locals have no houses and the situation has made property more expensive.</P>
    <P>A few steps can be taken to solve the problem. The ludicrous first time buyer's grant of £3,000 should be raised to at least £10,000 to keep pace with the price of houses and sites.  There should be a grant of £10,000 for old houses in rural areas to try to make people move to such places.  The condition would be that they would live in the house for ten years.  Local authority housing should be examined.  People move into council houses, move out after two years and sell them for a large profit.  I grew up in a local authority house and am proud of that.  People who buy local authority houses should live in them for ten years at least.  If they sell them, they should sell them back to local authorities for the price plus the rate of inflation for the few years they lived in them rather than to someone else.  Normally they are sold on to investors who rent them out. That is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is now a ridiculous situation stemming from a decision taken by the then Minister for the Environment, Pádraig Flynn, to abolish grants for second hand houses whereby there is no grant for young couples to buy a second hand house or for the repair of old houses.  It is time reconstruction grants were reintroduced for middle and low income earners, rather than millionaires, doctors and solicitors, who might have bought a property ten years ago and who now need new windows, doors or roofs.</P>
    <P>Another problem which has arisen in recent years because of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and do-gooders such as An Taisce is that people object to construction in rural areas.</P>
    <P>On the situation with puraflow systems, the Minister of State should introduce a scheme whereby a person granted planning permission and who must install a puraflow system, which costs £6,000 to £7,000, should receive a grant of £2,000 to £3,000 to assist them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which attempts to stamp out gazumping in the construction industry whereby builders refuse to sign contracts while they wait for higher offers from home purchasers, is overdue and I congratulate Deputy Hayes for bringing it before the House.  It should be illegal for a vendor to take an offer on a property after accepting an earlier offer from a purchaser.  It is outrageous for such a situation to occur although it is currently the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> There are no safeguards to protect young couples who find that builders refuse to sign binding contracts while they wait for higher offers from elsewhere.  If one enters into a simple transaction to buy a television, there are commitments of sale.  It is a matter of concern that basic consumer protection should be absent from the most important financial decision most people will make in their lifetimes.  By making it illegal for the vendor to enter into a further agreement with another purchaser when a booking deposit has already been paid, the practice of gazumping would disappear almost instantly.  I congratulate Deputy Hayes on introducing the Bill at this stage because the time for it is now.</P>
    <P>Some people cannot buy houses because builders, developers and bankers are making huge profits on house prices.  Why is Ireland the only country in Europe not to bring consumer protection into the housing market?  The claims by the Government that a voluntary code of practice will deal with the problem is laughable because it will never happen.  It needs regulations, rules and law. It is unreal that people are paying up to £100,000 for a three bedroom house with no regulation governing such a transaction.  Every possible retail service is legislated for.  Even if the label listing the ingredients of a cake sold in a supermarket is not properly attached to the top of it, the retailer and the manufacturer will be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>Last week in Dublin, prices for certain apartments rose by £10,000 during a lunch break.  This is unbelievable.  The great fear is that house price inflation represents a threat not only to the building industry but also to vital continuing economic growth.  The Minister said the construction industry has the potential for self-regulation.  It has had the opportunity for years and has repeatedly abused it.  The time has come for the Minister to use the power available to him to make regulations. The code of practice which he believes will develop will not be implemented on a voluntary basis.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should consider widening the powers of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform also has an important function in enforcing contract law in this area.  It is unbelievable that a deposit can be placed on a property and yet it is still for sale.</P>
    <P>The role of banks must be questioned because they are competing with each other to dish out money to young couples.  Any person selling a property has a nominated banker and can nominate five or six financial institutions which will give people loans of three to four times their gross salary.  It is wrong that children will be paying for their parents' houses in future.</P>
    <P>The cost of building a house today is £40 per square foot.  How can builders justify charging £150 per square foot?  Is that profit being taxed? In my business there is a cost price and a recommended retail price beyond which one cannot do <Col N="1004" /> business.  Apparently in this industry, anyone can do business if the money is made available.  The most frightening aspect is that, according to the Consumers' Association of Ireland, few home buyers whose deals have fallen through have gone to court because they believe there is no sympathy for them there.  They are dealing with sleazy professionals with plenty of money who can afford top barristers.  If people resorted to the courts, they would wind up with £2,000 of a legal bill and no house.  There should be statutory penalties for builders who cannot justify a price increase.</P>
    <P>The housing problem is one of the most serious crises in the past 20 years and it is getting worse. The purpose of the Bacon report was to push out investors to allow in first time buyers.  That has not happened.  First time buyers cannot enter the market.  Regulations must be introduced ensuring the purchaser has an entitlement when a deal is made.  Business is about trust and that has gone. The Minister should now accept Deputy Hayes's timely Bill which is a long overdue measure in this area.  The responsibility now rests with the Minister.</P>

      <P>Sections 1 and 8 of the Bill acknowledge the primary role of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to contract law.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal I have an interest in the subject matter of the Bill and its implications for house buyers.  In the main I will be addressing the housing policy aspects.</P>
      <P>The basic issues to be addressed when considering this Bill are its implications for various areas of law that come within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its practical implications for the process of property sales and conveyancing.  Therefore, I will only briefly refer to these legal difficulties and my colleague will deal with them in greater detail.  For the reasons we will outline, the Government will not be accepting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the Government's concern regarding recent reports of gazumping.  This practice has not been a traditional feature of the housing market and we would all agree it is not in the best interest of anyone involved in the housing market.  It is unacceptable to the Government to have a situation whereby prospective house buyers pay a booking deposit, albeit subject to subsequent exchange of contract, and a few months or even weeks later find themselves faced with a <Col N="1005" /> demand for a higher price than originally quoted, or are forced to abandon their plans.</P>
    <P>The report on house prices by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, economic consultants, referred to a number of market practices which were considered to be, at least, not in the best interest of consumers.  These include the phased release of new developments where this approach is used to ratchet-up prices; the return of booking deposits and subsequent gazumping of prices and instances of excessive staged payments.  The consultants stressed that it was not considered that such practices were widespread but that the impression was that they were increasing and where they occur it is to the detriment of consumers.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, gazumping arises where there is an understanding to sell a property to one party at an agreed price, but subsequently the vendor accepts a higher offer from another party prior to the completion of legal formalities with the original prospective purchaser.  The practice is invariably associated with a strong or overheating property market.  Such conditions have been a feature of the Irish housing market over the past few years and were evident before this Government took office.</P>
    <P>The provision of affordable housing is a priority for this Government.  This year we will achieve an all time record level of new house building.  In terms of Government investment in housing we are providing more than £437 million in the public capital programme, an increase of 26 per cent on the amount made available by the rainbow coalition last year.</P>
    <P>A prospective purchaser having paid a booking deposit to an estate agent may mistakenly believe that he or she has acquired an entitlement to purchase the property at an agreed price.  However, a booking deposit is paid before a formal contract is entered into and there is no obligation on either vendor or purchaser to conclude the sale or to do so at a particular price.  In a rising market, the vendor is in a strong position since there is likely to be little difficulty in finding another buyer.  On the other hand, the purchaser is in a weaker position, having paid a deposit and geared his or her plans and finances to purchase the particular property.  The booking deposit system, which has generally served both buyers and sellers quite well, needs to operate in an evenhanded manner.  In this regard, transactions should proceed on the terms initially envisaged. Unless there are major extenuating circumstances, a situation should not arise whereby the house price is increased after payment of the booking deposit.</P>
    <P>However, the Bill now before the House does not provide a solution to the problem of gazumping. The basic approach in the Bill is seriously defective from a legal standpoint and is not capable of being amended to provide a sensible solution because of the extent of constitutional and practical difficulties with the Bill.  Not only would this Bill fail in its stated objective of dealing with <Col N="1006" /> problems of gazumping, it would be likely to create difficulties, confusion and uncertainty in the process of selling a residential property.  I am conscious not only of the legal advice but also of concerns expressed to my Department by mortgage lending and auctioneering interests and the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Let me cite some examples of the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>One practical problem with the Bill is its possible adverse impact on the interdependent buyer and seller chain where a house buyer is simultaneously selling an existing property.  The rigid timescales in the Bill would have undesirable consequences in this regard.  It takes no account of factors such as delays due to investigation of title, the assessment of value and physical condition and application for mortgage approval which can lead to delays in property transactions.  It can often be in a buyer's interest to have a degree of breathing space in closing a deal where they are trying to sell their existing house.  If this breathing space is artificially constrained there would be considerable practical difficulties for buyers in entering into commitments and consequent disruption to the chain of transactions in the market.</P>
    <P>Under present circumstances, buyers, sellers and their solicitors can come to mutually acceptable arrangements with regard to the timing of the various transactions involved.  This Bill would tie everyone's hands to the extent that no flexibility would be available in regard to the timing of the sale of houses.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that the proposers of the Bill may not have taken due account of its possible implications for other legislation.  In particular, it does not appear to take due cognisance of the long-standing legal requirement, going back for several hundred years, that a contract for the sale of land, which, of course, includes a house, must be evidenced in writing in order to be enforceable.  The possible implications on family law protection legislation are neither recognised nor addressed by this Bill.  Therefore, the Bill is deeply flawed for reasons that my colleague will go into in greater detail.</P>
    <P>Apart from the defects in this Bill, it is likely that any similar legislative approach which sought to place restrictions on someone's rights to sell their property as they see fit, would have to address profound constitutional and legal issues in the area of property rights.  However, I do not want to totally exclude the possibility of there being scope for action in the legislative area.  In view of the complexity of the legal issues in the areas of contract law, conveyancing etc., and the need to consider possible implications very carefully, the scope for any possible legislative approach to this matter is something that might be referred to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>There are clearly considerable doubts about the appropriateness of approaching the issue of gazumping by means of legislative restrictions or sanctions and it is not an approach which can be entered into without careful legal research and consideration.  Rather than attempting a quick fix <Col N="1007" /> legislative approach which could create more problems than it solves, the approach favoured by the Government is to pursue practical measures which will help to improve the situation in the short term, while arranging to have the possibility of any appropriate legal response carefully and thoroughly examined.</P>
    <P>The consultants on the house price study recommended a written voluntary code of practice as the most effective means of limiting undesirable practices such as gazumping by some house builders and suggested that the professional representative body of home builders could play a positive role through the introduction of such a code.  Following the publication of the Bacon report and the launch of the Government's Action on House Prices, I raised the question of formulating a code of practice to deal with undesirable market practices with the Irish Home Builders Association.  I am glad the response of the association has been very positive.  It has assured me that it has made considerable progress on the draft code of practice in regard to the problems of gazumping and excessive stage payments.</P>
    <P>I understand the association will propose a code of practice which enshrines the principle that where a booking deposit is made for the purchase of a house at a particular price, the transaction should proceed to conclusion, subject to appropriate conditions and requirements being satisfied.  While the association's proposals will have to be carefully considered when finalised, I hope we will arrive at a successful conclusion and I will continue to press for finalisation of the code of practice as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand there might be some concern as to the likely effectiveness of a voluntary code. However, I point to the success of the Home-Bond new house guarantee scheme as an excellent example of how voluntary self-regulation can and does work effectively in the house building industry, with considerable benefit to the consumer. The code of practice approach is that favoured by the Director of Consumer Affairs and also by the Law Society.</P>
    <P>Having recommended the adoption of a code of practice as the preferred option to address the gazumping issue, the consultants suggested that, if it was found that such a code of practice could not be implemented effectively on a voluntary basis by the professional representative body of home builders, consideration should be given to widening the statutory powers of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs in this area.  This is a legislative option which remains open to the Government should the voluntary code of practice not produce the desired result.</P>
    <P>In addressing this Bill, I have necessarily concentrated on the practical implications for the housing market and also the specific course of action which is being taken by the Government to address the gazumping issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> However, it is important to recognise there is a general housing market dimension to this whole question.  The most fundamental safeguard against the occurrence of problems such as gazumping lies in addressing the market conditions that allow them to happen.  Gazumping is a symptom of an overheated market.  As the consultants pointed out, if the market was not overheated in the first instance, it would be very difficult to make such practices effective.</P>
    <P>The Government responded quickly and decisively to the Bacon report on house prices with a comprehensive package of measures announced in its Action on House Prices published on 23 April 1998.  The package involved a three-pronged approach to increase the potential supply of housing, address factors causing overheating or distortions in the market, and improve the position of prospective first time buyers.  The full effect of some of the measures, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, will be seen only in the medium term.  Positive effects have already been reported by market sources, including signs of some easing of house prices, first time buyers reclaiming the starter home market, which had been increasingly dominated by investors, and an increase in the number of second hand houses coming on the market as a result of stamp duty reductions.  Housing output in 1998 is set to exceed last year's record level.  The Government's approach, therefore, is to pursue the course of action recommended in the Bacon report and accepted by the Government in Action on House Prices, while at the same time, keeping the option of a properly thought out and effective legislative response as a back up if the voluntary code of practice fails to deliver the goods.</P>

If the Fine Gael Bill were adopted, such deposits would cease to be taken, thus nullifying its intended effect.

      <P>Also the Director of Consumer Affairs has expressed serious reservations about the effects of the Bill and the lack of research into the effects it would have on other legislation.  It would add major confusion in the housing market. A synopsis of his views, from a letter he sent us dated 5 October is that the implications of any proposal in this area would have to be properly researched to avoid house purchasers ending up more confused than ever, as would have happened if the Fine Gael Bill were adopted.  The comprehensive actions taken by the Government to deal with the housing crisis are unprecedented in their scale and contrast starkly with the inaction of our predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has already outlined some of the reasons the Government opposes the Bill. However, there are some additional matters on which I will concentrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that the issue which Deputy Hayes has sought to highlight in bringing forward this Bill is one which gives rise, and rightly so, to deep-seated feelings of anger and frustration when encountered by those who are seeking to buy a house.  This is the case regardless of whether the people involved are first time buyers or already have a foot on the home-owning ladder. Acquiring a house or moving house is generally regarded as one of the most stressful experiences we are likely to have during our lifetimes. Therefore, it seems unfair and unjust that the normal stress associated with the experience should be magnified by bad behaviour on the part of those who take advantage of a rising market <Col N="1010" /> to maximise the profit which will accrue to them from the transaction.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot always punish bad behaviour by the use of criminal sanctions.  Furthermore, while most right-minded people will naturally abhor the greed and selfishness which can characterise the practice we commonly refer to as gazumping, we must be careful that any proposed remedy is proportionate and does not add further to some of the inequities which may be in the housing market.</P>
    <P>It may be useful if I outline, briefly, some aspects of contract and conveyancing law which have a bearing on the Bill.  In part, this is because one of the problems which the Bill presents is that it tends to confuse and conflate several aspects of the conveyancing process and this makes it difficult to talk, in a meaningful way, about some of its central elements.</P>
    <P>Contracts for the sale of land are part of a process which puts them in a different category to other contracts.  The process is quite complex and this reflects the vitally important nature of the transaction at issue.  Of crucial importance is the need to ensure that a purchaser gets good title to the property which he or she has contracted to buy.  Otherwise he or she may find that the asset on which he or she has expended a large sum of money is difficult, if not impossible, to sell on at a later stage.</P>
    <P>When a person engages in the purchase of property, there are a number of legal steps he or she must follow.  To put it at its simplest, there is the stage before any binding contract is made, there is the conclusion of the formalities necessary to make a binding contract for the sale of the property in question and, finally, there is the conveyance of that property which ultimately sees the title in the property pass from the vendor to the purchaser.  In a normal transaction it would not be unusual for a period of at least six weeks to elapse between the date the contract for sale has become binding on the vendor and purchaser and the closing date for the transaction.  While pre-contract inquiries are becoming more usual, matters of detail, especially those which pertain to title, may have to be sorted out during this intervening period.</P>
    <P>Under our law, contracts for the sale of land, if they are to be enforceable by action, must be evidenced in writing.  Most often, this will take the form of a full written contract but an oral agreement, supplemented by a written note or memorandum, can, in certain circumstances, be sufficient.  The remedy which has evolved to deal with the situation where an aggrieved party wishes to enforce a contract for the sale of land is the action for specific performance, whereby a court, at the behest of one party, will order the other party to carry out the contract strictly according to its terms.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances, the doctrine of part performance may apply so that an oral agreement for the sale of land may be enforced, despite the absence of written evidence.  This does not mean <Col N="1011" /> there was no contract to begin with.  Rather, what is being pleaded is that there is an oral contract which the other party, for whatever reason, is refusing to honour.  Case law provides us with clear examples of where part performance might be relevant.  One such example would be where the alleged vendor has vacated the property and the alleged purchaser has taken possession. Another would be where expenditure has been incurred in making alterations or improvements to the property which is the subject of the alleged agreement.</P>
    <P>One thing we must be clear about is that this Bill is attempting to deal with the situation where there is absolutely no contract between the parties.  The payment of a deposit on entering into a contact for the sale of land is usually regarded as an essential element of the transaction but is not to be confused with a booking deposit paid before the contract for sale is entered into which has no legal standing whatsoever.  As the legislation stands a fundamental principle of conveyancing law is that a booking deposit gives the purchaser no interest in the property to which the deposit relates.  Contrary to what the Bill suggests, payment of such a deposit does not constitute a preliminary agreement between vendor and purchaser and payment of it does not in any way commit the parties to a contract.  If we are to depart from that fundamental principle it is essential that we carefully consider the implications.</P>
    <P>The freedom to negotiate is an essential part of the contractual relationship.  The Bill would attach rights to the payment of a booking deposit which do not currently exist and which would result in a curtailment of the vendor's freedom to sell a property to whomsoever he or she wishes. The Deputy may well have considered the constitutional parameters within which he sought to frame the Bill, but I wonder if the property right guarantees contained in the Constitution have been taken into account as fully as they might be.</P>
    <P>Under Article 40.3.2 of the Constitution the State is bound to protect the property rights of every citizen from unjust attack and in the case of injustice done to vindicate those rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about those with no property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 43 is concerned exclusively with private property matters and it is quite clear that the general right to transfer property guaranteed by Article 43.1.2 of the Constitution encompasses a guaranteed right to transfer specific items of property such as a house or a plot of land.  The Bill would interfere with those rights.  While only the courts can state categorically whether the interference is unconstitutional, the advice available to me is that at the least there are serious risks of unconstitutionality attaching to the Deputy's proposal.  We must be cautious <Col N="1012" /> about attaching conditions to the exercise of a particular right in relation to property which might reasonably be viewed as oppressive. However tempting it might be, statutory intervention which restricts the free operation of the market in a way which might be considered unjust cannot be upheld no matter how worthy the intentions might be of those who propose that intervention.</P>
      <P>I have considerable sympathy for those on the other side of the House who seek to advance the legislative process by putting forward Bills on matters where they feel there is a need for reform and I accept their task is a difficult one.  However, in this case the Bill is not only short on certain drafting matters but there are problems both of principle and practice in the approach it takes.</P>
      <P>The Long Title refers to the fact that the Bill is directed towards preventing vendors from unreasonably increasing the sale prices of residential properties.  This implies that there may be circumstances where some increase is reasonable but no attempt is made to define when this might be.  The Bill also makes little allowance for the fact that there can be legitimate reasons vendors and purchasers have to withdraw from property transactions.  There can be changes in family circumstances, for example, which make a contemplated sale no longer possible.  There can also be changes in financial circumstances which have the same effect.</P>
      <P>While contracts for the sale of land may form a special class of contract, they are also subject to the general principles which govern the law of contract.  For example, there must be an offer and an acceptance.  There must also be a consideration and an intention to create legal relations. Furthermore, a party who is forced into a contract against his or her will may, if they successfully plea duress, have that contract declared void.  The Bill cuts across many of these fundamental principles and causes me to question whether the Deputy has seriously thought through the full implications of his proposal.</P>
      <P>It is a legacy of our legal history that transactions involving the sale of land are complicated. The Bill prescribes certain timescales which it imposes regardless of circumstances.  It presupposes an ideal world where problems with loan finance, title and planning, to take but a few examples, simply do not exist.  Not only does it constrain vendors which is its ostensible purpose, but it imposes equal constraints upon purchasers. The purchase of a house is one of the most important transactions an individual is likely to engage in during his or her lifetime.  It is not unreasonable that the transaction should be given as much time as it needs and it is a downside of the Bill that it could draw individuals prematurely into binding contracts on which they are then compelled to follow through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill would impose criminal sanctions for breach of its provisions.  Leaving aside any constitutional difficulties to which such a proposal may give rise, I have strong doubts as to whether this <Col N="1013" /> is an appropriate way to proceed.  We may be talking about conduct which is less than honourable but we are not talking about fraud.  I question the appropriateness of criminal sanctions in this context.  We may not condone the actions which the Bill seeks to prevent but the relationship between the action and the sanction must be a reasonable one and the Bill simply does not contain the necessary element of reasonableness and balance.</P>
    <P>The Bill assumes that the existing practice of booking deposits will continue and uses the peg of such deposits upon which to hang the full weight of its proposals.  I will say no more than that such confidence might prove to be misplaced.</P>
    <P>The Bill also distinguishes between residential and other kinds of property so that a different regime would apply in the case of the former, one which would be ostensibly at least more favourable to the would be purchaser.  Without being categoric on the issue I wonder whether this distinction is justifiable in all cases.</P>
    <P>Finally and perhaps not surprisingly given the current market, the Bill focuses on the problem of gazumping where the vendor takes advantage of a rising market to sell at a higher price to another buyer than the one he or she was originally in negotiation with.  However, when the trend is in the opposite direction it is the vendor who is in the vulnerable position.  If we are to be even handed we must condemn unscrupulous purchasers just as much as unscrupulous vendors, although I am the first to admit that it is the unfortunate purchaser who stands to lose at present.  Legislation which fails to balance the scales and take the broader picture into account runs the risk of being seen as inequitable.</P>
    <P>I do not think we can use the law to force individuals to sell property against their will.  If there is a contract the law will enforce it, but where there is no contract there is a question to be answered as to whether we can deem one to exist and then criminalise the party who refuses to be bound by this statutory deeming.</P>
    <P>I cannot pretend that an easy legislative solution to this matter is possible.  The circumstances attendant upon the formation of individual contracts for the sale of land can be very varied and there are limits to the extent to which it may be possible to regulate behaviour in this area by way of legislation.  There are also boundaries to the extent to which a Government can interfere in regulating the market and we have to be cautious in dealing with one very specific problem lest we give rise to even greater attendant problems.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very deeply flawed.  It has a number of legal infirmities and is unworkable in practice. While I am reluctant to criticise the Deputy too much, I suspect he is less concerned with reform of conveyancing law than with presenting an opportunistic Bill which merely offers the semblance of a solution to the minority of purchasers who have found themselves in a gazumping situation. The Government is tackling the housing issue in a way which is coherent and structured. <Col N="1014" /> We are concerned to devise real solutions which can work and which will yield long lasting dividends.</P>
    <P>For the reasons I have mentioned and those previously mentioned by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, the Government must reject the approach contained in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely and thoughtful Bill introduced by Deputy Hayes.  The Bill is an attempt to respond to one of the most irritating and frustrating aspects of the current housing crisis. Deputy Hayes has tried to address the outrageous behaviour of builders and developers recently highlighted by the press.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government is presiding over a disastrous housing situation.  In recent months, it has hidden behind the skirts of the Bacon report.  Government members are clearly afraid to take on their own friends in the construction industry and face up to the harsh realities which tens of thousands of young men and women are facing.  Tonight we are witnessing the Government's wilful opposition to reasonable legislation.  The Labour Party will table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage but its central thesis in attempting to deal with an outrageous situation deserves praise.</P>
      <P>In the four Dublin county council areas we have the appalling vista of 12,000 or 13,000 families waiting for housing with up to £100 million being spent by the Eastern Health Board to secure private rented accommodation for people, not all of whom are on the housing list.  Different housing systems operate throughout the country and people require more and more housing points to qualify for the limited amount of housing available.  This Government seems to be living in cloud cuckooland in regard to the desperate situation which pertains throughout the country and it will be severely punished for that in the upcoming by-election in Cork and, indeed, in the next general election.</P>
      <P>In regard to the shared ownership system, people on incomes of less than £15,000 are faced with the prospect of repaying £80 to £100 per week or up to £450 per month on a mortgage for a 40 to 60 per cent share of a house in the Dublin region.  House price inflation has effectively condemned many thousands of young people to the prospect that they will never be able to own property in spite of the Minister's concern about protecting people's property rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis is acute in the Dublin city area; this year the city administration, which is responsible for one seventh of the people in the country, received the princely allocation of 230 houses. <Col N="1015" /> The Minister of State with responsibility for housing cut the housing allocation figure this year and Dublin Corporation was only able to purchase 70 houses.  In my constituency, which encompasses a huge area of the city, no houses have been purchased in the past four or five months.  The situation is even worse in the Fingal County Council area as my colleague, Deputy Ryan, will detail. In my own area of Fingal, dozens of local families face a desperate housing problem.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister exercising control on the auctioneering profession, builders and developers.  Those professions have, to a great degree, played a key role in gazumping the market. It is extraordinary that Deputy Ring, a member of the auctioneering profession, admitted it had played a big part in fanning the flames of the housing market.  I noticed a dramatic rise in house prices when a prominent south side auctioneering firm opened on the north side of the city.  Prices seemed to suddenly jump by £10,000 to £15,000; that certainly sucks the marrow from the bone of people on very low incomes.  Of course the auctioneering profession is totally unregulated.  Why does the Minister not introduce a Bill to regulate the profession?  Anybody can become an auctioneer if they have £10,000.  The Minister has a responsibility to the young families of Ireland to regulate the profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced three Bills to bring some fairness into this economy but they were thrown out by the Government.  People are making up to 200 per cent profit in the housing market but the Minister is not prepared to examine the issue.</P>
      <P>We are witnessing a rezoning frenzy in north and south-west Dublin at the moment with the Flood tribunal due to meet in the near future. Local government in Ireland has very little real power yet it has been granted the important power to rezone land.  It is little wonder that some politicians were allegedly corrupted in the process. The healthy relationship which existed between the construction industry and elected representatives in the past is being corrupted.</P>
      <P>The Estimates will be published in a few weeks' time in the lead up to the budget and the escalation of house prices and the terrible problems that presents for people on low incomes must be addressed.  The Government is on target to have at least £700 million in budget surplus and should come up with some proposals to increase the supply of housing.  Money for the private rented sector in the health board area could be reallocated towards the expansion of the housing supply in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week, I asked the Minister for Environment and Local Government if he was prepared to admit the division of Dublin into four <Col N="1016" /> county council areas was a failure.  The Minister should consider having a single housing authority and list for Dublin which would be overseen by the city manager.  Perhaps there could be close involvement with Meath, Kildare and Wicklow County Councils.  We need to look at regional spatial development solutions.  So far this Minister has walked away from that.  We need to have restoration of power at local level.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues referred to over-lending by financial institutions.  On a day when our biggest building society has become a privatised company and we are left with only one or two large mutual societies, societies which were founded primarily to help couples on lower incomes, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, might examine that matter in greater detail and come up with ideas.  Demographic factors have fuelled this, particularly in the Dublin region, with a massive return of skilled Irish people and the recent influx of people from other countries.  A number of other areas might be looked at in closer detail, and we will certainly do that in Committee.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Hayes and his party for bringing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Notwithstanding our reservations about certain aspects of it, the Labour Party will be fully supporting this Bill tomorrow night.  I compliment Deputy Hayes.  In the Seanad I introduced a Bill on development and unfinished estates and so on which was rejected by the Government.  Here is yet another Bill dealing with developers and housing to which the Government is saying no and on which it is not prepared to take decisive action.</P>
      <P>Coming from the constituency of North Dublin, I am acutely aware of the need to protect consumers during the whole process of house purchasing. The current housing shortage, particularly in the urban centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway, is putting enormous pressure on people who are house hunting.  The problem should not be made infinitely worse.  What we need is Government action.</P>
      <P>On the question of gazumping, the Minister gave the impression that this was something new. Nothing could be further from the truth.  Four years ago in my constituency couples seeking to take the first step up the ladder and buy a house of their own found that over a weekend the cost of the house had increased by £2,000; by the following weekend it had increased by £5,000 from the original price and, within a fortnight, on the same housing estate, the cost had gone up by £12,000.  That is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nothing short of scandalous that it should take a Private Members' Bill to persuade the Minister with responsibility for housing to come into this House to make a contribution.  If this was a caring Government, if it was concerned about the basic needs of ordinary people, it would acknowledge that there is a housing shortage, a <Col N="1017" /> housing emergency, and respond in a positive way.  Both Ministers who contributed tonight gave a despicable response to the emergency in the housing market.  The average cost of a house in the Dublin area in 1995 was £70,000.  The cost of the site, labour and materials was £50,000. Today the cost of a house in Dublin is £120,000, but the cost of the land, labour and materials is £55,000.  The difference is the profit.  Most of this problem is caused by greed.</P>

      <P>It is greed on the part of builders who are currently doing exceptionally well.  The Minister referred in glowing terms to the home bond system.  I have dealt, as have others here, with people who are paying £200 a week to try to get a home of their own and whose houses are left unfinished.  This is a disgrace at a time when builders are making huge profits.</P>
      <P>We spoke earlier about the Minister's response to the housing emergency.  The Bacon report was going to solve the whole problem.  It is not much consolation to first time house buyers to be told that, notwithstanding the Bacon report, the increase in the cost of housing since 1 January this year is 20 per cent, and the Minister is taking credit for that.  This is a scandal.</P>
      <P>Regarding local authority housing, currently there are nearly 40,000 people on housing lists throughout the length and breadth of the country. This afternoon a constituent appealed to me to come and see where she and her partner and three children were living.  They had a mobile home with condensation dripping from the ceiling, the bed clothes were saturated, there was fungus around the walls and water dripping down them.  This is Ireland of the Celtic tiger economy but this is one area about which we do not hear from the Taoiseach.  Ministers should stand up and be counted on this issue.</P>

      <P>I wish to concentrate on the two aspects of the Dublin Transportation Office recommendation which give me most cause for concern.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, for coming to the House but I regret that neither the Minister for the Environment and Local Government nor the Minister for Public Enterprise saw fit to attend.</P>
      <P>This is an emergency short-term action plan.  It is not the solution to congestion but merely an attempt to identify what is necessary to hold the chaos at bay until the year 2000.  It is an attempt to prevent Dublin traffic congestion from crossing the line from mere chaos to total breakdown.</P>
      <P>Last April the Minister for Public Enterprise told me in this House that she expected to have that plan on her desk by the end of the month.  It did not arrive by the end of the month, although it had been drafted by the Dublin Transportation Office, because the transportation office and the agencies which comprise it could not agree on either its content or its presentation.</P>
      <P>When the plan finally arrived on the Government's desk towards the end of July it languished there throughout the summer.  It finally saw the light of day last Tuesday, the day before the Dáil resumed and when I had tabled a parliamentary question on the Government's response to it. Would the plan still be lying on a Government desk if I had not tabled that question?</P>
      <P>The handling of this emergency plan gives a whole new meaning to our understanding of the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;.  It highlights yet again the complete inadequacy of the structures we have in place to deliver a quality public transport service in Dublin.  We have a multiplicity of agencies, all with their own priorities and all reporting to a variety of Ministers, with no single person with political responsibility for the delivery of a decent transport service.</P>
      <P>This is evidenced, if evidence were needed, in my constituency every morning.  The Knocklyon and Rathfarnham areas are now famous because they feature every morning on AA Roadwatch. Traffic chaos reigns and has become a way of life. It is a genuine crisis which requires a co-ordinated and urgent response.  Instead, we have paralysis of the traffic and paralysis of the of the agencies which might be in a position to respond.</P>
      <P>When the mere preparation of the plan overran by six months, what confidence can we have that its actual implementation will do any better, particularly given the time scale envisaged if the plan is to be effective and chaos avoided?  The year 2000 seems a very tight time scale when we have already wasted six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, will read me the list of measures in the plan for which funding is available.  I agree that much of the plan is being funded, which I welcome despite my realisation that the funding came only as a <Col N="1019" /> result of the reallocation of funding due to the complete mess made of the Luas project.</P>
    <P>However, I want the Minister of State to address the fundamental recommendation of the Dublin Transportation Office that operational funding should be provided for public transport on an ongoing annual basis.  This is the measure on which the success of the entire plan depends &mdash; every element of the plan depends on the provision of ongoing operational subvention.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus requires additional buses but if the Minister of State were to tell me tonight that Dublin Bus could buy another 200 buses in the morning, I could tell him that those buses would lie idle in Dublin Bus garages &mdash; as they have before &mdash; unless Dublin Bus was given a subvention to make its operation viable.  Unless the Government accepts the fundamental principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell for raising this important issue.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, is out of the country on important Government business.  I have no doubt that, but for that, she would be here to do the Deputy the courtesy of dealing with the matter.  I hope I can be of help.</P>
      <P>The short-term action plan proposed capital investment of about £171 million over the next two years and some £146 million had already been committed.  The DTO short-term action plan builds on the work done to date in implementing the strategy of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and contains a range of short-term measures which can be implemented between now and 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> They are designed to tackle approximately 49,000 excess trips by car in the morning peak across the greater Dublin area by 1999.  These have arisen from a combination of two principal factors: unprecedented economic growth which, in turn, has led to much greater than expected traffic growth and, slower than anticipated implementation of major elements of the DTI strategy, including major road projects, Luas and quality bus corridors.  The main focus of the short-term action plan is to transfer about 37,000 of these 49,000 excess car trips to other modes of transport, with 33,000 going to public transport and 4,000 to cycling.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's particular interest relates to public transport, where the plan includes measures designed to provide up to 21,600 extra bus passenger trips and an extra 11,300 suburban rail passenger trips in the peak period.  While the plan has only recently been published, the need for action had been anticipated and most of the public transport recommendations of the DTO action plan have already been approved for implementation.</P>
    <P>Virtually all the recommended suburban rail and DART programmes have been approved for speedy introduction.  As part of the reallocation of the Luas EU assistance, approval has been given for the acquisition of an additional 50 buses, at a total cost of £8.5 million.  These buses are expected to be delivered in autumn 1999. They will be used on the quality bus corridors and will increase morning rush hour capacity by 3,500.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that this is the first occasion on which the European Commission has agreed to co-finance the purchase of buses.  Furthermore, and again for the first time, the balance of the funding for the acquisition of these buses is to be provided by the Exchequer through the normal Estimates/budget process.</P>
    <P>There has been no complacency on the Government's part.  We ensured that the DTI strategy was kept under review and have proceeded quickly to implement measures to remedy shortfalls which have been identified.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath will also acquire, from its own resources, more than 120 double decker buses in 1998 and 1999 to replace an equivalent number of old single and double decker buses.  This will increase capacity by some 2,450 passenger trips. The action plan also proposes that Bus Átha Cliath subcontracts school bus services.  This would release buses for use in the morning peak commuter services and provide capacity for an extra 4,200 passenger trips.  This measure is part of the wider restructuring negotiations which are being considered by the Labour Court at present.</P>
    <P>The DTO short-term action plan also identified a requirement for 100 extra buses and the need for additional State subvention to support expanded peak hour bus services.  These recommendations will be considered by the Government as part of the Estimates/budget process.</P>
    <P>The various initiatives to increase bus capacity are being taken in tandem with the acceleration <Col N="1021" /> of the quality bus corridor network.  This network will be extended to 12 routes with the addition of a QBC to Ballymun.  Additional funding of over £9.4 million has been provided as part of the reallocation of the Luas aid.  This means that approximately £12 million will be allocated in DTO traffic management grants in 1999 and 2000 for the implementation of QBCs.</P>
    <P>It is essential that CIE maximises the contribution it can make from its own resources to funding these requirements.  It is clear that substantial additional investment in public transport is required, not only in Dublin but also in the mainline rail network.  With this in mind the Minister for Public Enterprise met the CIE chairman earlier today and asked him to take urgent action to ensure that the company's property assets, which are surplus to public transport requirements, are disposed of as quickly as possible over the next five years to help meet the enhanced capital expenditure programme.  It was agreed that the chairman would report back to the Minister by the end of November.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue which is of vital importance to thousands of families and home helps throughout the country.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for being here to listen to my concerns but I am disappointed the Minister could not make time to be here.</P>
      <P>As everyone knows, home helps are paid a miserly amount.  There is no unified structure across the country &mdash; each health board pays a different rate and no health board pays home helps anything like a fair rate for the important work they do.  The North-Eastern Health Board pays home helps £2.20 per hour, the Western Health Board pays £2.42 per hour, and, in my area, the Southern Health Board pays the miserly and insulting sum of £2 per hour.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the commitment and dedication of home helps who do tremendous work.  They are predominantly women, they do a fantastic job which is of great benefit to the community and provide an invaluable service to thousands of sick and elderly people.  The Labour Party believes they deserve fair play and a fair rate of pay, and I demand that the Minister tells the House the action he intends to take to resolve this vital issue.  He commissioned an independent study on the pay and conditions of home helps, which was to be conducted with the assistance of the National Council on Ageing and Older People and it was to be on his desk this summer.  What action does he intend to take on foot of this important report?  He cannot delay any longer. He must act now to ensure funding is released to each health board to ensure home helps get the pay they deserve for the work they do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been in office for 15 months and has had ample time to deal with the issue.  To date his only reaction has been to delve into history <Col N="1022" /> and to blame past Administrations for the pay of home helps.  This attitude is not good enough and will no longer fool the people.  The buck stops with the Minister and he cannot try to avoid this issue.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and I believe the rate of pay for home helps must be increased without delay to at least £4.20 per hour.  This is the minimum wage rate which the National Minimum Wage Commission recommended should be paid to workers throughout the country, and which the Government has accepted; however, we are still waiting for concrete action.  It is disgraceful that home helps should struggle to make ends meet on £2 per hour when the Government has an excellent report which states the least a worker should be paid is £4.20 per hour.  There is real anger in the community about this issue.  We do not want to hear fine words about future intentions but that the Minister accepts the position and will provide justice for home help workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The home help service is widely recognised as a key service in supporting dependent people in their homes.  However, it is also generally accepted that there are a number of problems relating to the organisation and development of home help services which need to be addressed in order to realise the full potential of this service.  My Department has consulted with the chief executive officers of the health boards on a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within health boards for the provision of this service.  Following on from those discussions, my Department commissioned an examination of the home help service by the policy research centre of the National College of Ireland under the direction of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  It is expected that this report will be submitted to me and published shortly.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that the recommendations of the report will be fully considered with a view to early implementation.  Although not within the terms of reference of this study, I understand reference was made to the question of payments to home helps.  In this regard, I acknowledge that the system of remuneration of home helps, both in relation to rates of payment and standardisation across health boards, needs to be addressed. The Department is currently examining how this might be achieved in the context of the availability of resources.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can take it we will look at this seriously before the next budget.  Despite what she might say, when her party was in power, it had an opportunity to look at the issue but I do not think much was done about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I raise this matter because I was baffled by the circumstances. When asked what happened to children in care, I answer that the custom in the South-Eastern Health Board is that they are placed with families who try to fill the void in the children's lives to that point.  I was therefore amazed when I heard that a 15 year old was placed in lodgings over a pub with a carer in his early twenties.  For that reason I am anxious to hear the Eastern Health Board's policy on looking after children in care.  If the facts I was given are true, that was not a suitable place to put a 15 year old who was out of family care.  Such a child needs training, guidance and help.  In this case I was taken aback by what I learned.  Does the Minister think this is good enough for a person who is in care and needs help?  If this is the practice of the Eastern Health Board, why is it so?  I await the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffat Dr. Moffat">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffat</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to this adjournment debate in the unavoidable absence of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey.  The statutory responsibility for responding to the needs of children who are not receiving adequate care and attention is that of the Eastern Health Board which is an independent statutory agency.  The position is set out in section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which provides that it shall be a function of every health board to promote the welfare of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  In the performance of this function, a health board shall take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in its area, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, whether under the Constitution or otherwise, regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration, and in so far as is practicable, give due consideration having regard to his or her age and understanding to the wishes of the child and have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interest of a child to be brought up in his own family.</P>
      <P>As regards the general issue raised by the Deputy, officials of my Department have been in contact with the Eastern Health Board and have been advised that the board's priority is to maintain children in the home environment providing necessary supports to the parents as required. Where this is not possible, the next preferred option is foster care as it is considered that this most closely replicates a family environment.  In this regard, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will shortly announce an initiative in regard to foster care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> Residential care for children is seen as appropriate in cases where the first two options have not been successful &mdash; for example, in the case of children who exhibit challenging behaviour.  Residential care can be delivered in ordinary residential units which operate in a community setting or in high support or in special care units in the case of children who cannot be located in an ordinary community setting.</P>
    <P>In all cases where children are taken into residential care, the aim is to return the child to either the family or foster care if this is in the best interests of the child.  The maintenance of links with the family is emphasised by way of visits or a return home for short periods.  Generally, the aim is to ensure that account is taken of the constitutional position of the family and to ensure that the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991 &mdash; the main statutory basis for child care &mdash; are fully implemented.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific issue, the board has also advised my officials that it would not be appropriate for the board to make any public statement in regard to the detail of an individual case.  In general, the board makes the point that children who have to be taken into care are assessed at the earliest possible date to ensure that the most appropriate form of care is provided.  Occasionally, there may be problems in conducting the assessment or in securing a suitable placement and in such cases specific individual arrangements may be made while a suitable placement is being identified.  The board is fully conscious of the importance of finalising such cases as a matter of urgency.  I am grateful for the opportunity of clarifying the position in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State is present.  There are two special schools in Castlebar, St. Anthony's and St. Brid's.  These schools cater for children from a wide area in County Mayo and deal with a range of disabilities and handicap between the ages of five and 19 years. Transport is provided by nine mini buses under contract to Bus Éireann for 60 pupils from all over the south Mayo catchment area.  No bus escorts are provided by the Department of Education and Science.  In the case of St. Anthony's, only one child care assistant for the entire school is provided by the Department.  One child care attendant acts on a one to one basis and the bus escorts one of the four terminally ill pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four of the nine mini buses travel on routes where escorts are required because of the nature and personality of the children involved.  These are operated by Joe Daly carrying children from the Cong area, Tom Moran carrying children <Col N="1025" /> from the Ballyhaunis area, Luke Kavanagh carrying children from the Kilmaine area and Brendan McGing carrying children from the Croagh Patrick-Westport area.  No recognition is given even to a blind eight year old restrained with a special harness.  I call on the Minister of State to extend the pilot scheme of grant aid to the provision of escorts on certain transport services to cater for these difficult school runs, to do so immediately and thereafter to consider extending it nationwide.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the scheme issued by the Department in December 1994 states: &ldquo;in order to establish eligibility for support school authorities are required to provide evidence of need for an escort service among the pupils attending the school&rdquo;.  Such evidence would relate to the prevalence of pupils whose behaviour is such as to constitute a potential danger to themselves or to others with whom they share a special transport service and the prevalence of pupils whose condition is of such severity as to warrant constant adult supervision while in transit on the special school system.</P>
    <P>The following is a list of the categories of pupils catered for in the school: Down's syndrome, 19; cerebral palsy, 13; spina bifida, one; Hunter's syndrome, three &mdash; one is now at home; language disorders, 14; autistic tendencies, four; attention deficit disorder, five; hyperactive, seven; asthma, two; socially deprived, eight; blind, one; diabetic, one; coeliac, two; epilepsy, three; sight loss, 20; sight/hearing, seven; eating disorder, one; William's syndrome, one and Ptoses syndrome, one.</P>
    <P>Some of these pupils are not capable of looking after themselves in transit to and from school. Many do not have the level of understanding to cope with safety measures, such as the importance of not tampering with the emergency door, windows, switches, etc.  Drivers need to concentrate on control of their vehicles without the stress of interruption from passengers.  Pupils need help in getting in and out of vehicles, particularly those with poor balance, physical disability and mobility appliances.  Because of their hearing and sight loss, they are distractible and lack concentration on their movements.</P>
    <P>Because of the failure of the Department of Education and Science to provide escorts, St. Anthony's has trained escorts over a three year period under the FÁS community employment scheme.  The work involved travelling on bus routes that were problematic for pupils.  The escorts were trained in manual lifting, first aid, harnessing and safety measures, such as coping with epilepsy.  Their hours span 19.5 hours per week.  They stayed in school during the school hours and learned additional skills.  These escorts are now available and are fully trained and experienced to take up position immediately. One of the mini bus operators wrote to me saying that &ldquo;in the case of another child, he has ripped a speaker from its mounting, torn down notices and thrown objects such as school bags and bottles and in the most serious incident he succeeded <Col N="1026" /> in unlocking the emergency door&rdquo;.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>At a time when Government coffers are being swelled by £800 million, there should be an extension of the pilot scheme to this school immediately, otherwise we will deprive some of the most beautiful children of their right to an education. For the few pounds involved, it would be scandalous to turn one's back on such experience and expertise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenny and I tabled the matter on the Adjournment because of the serious situation which pertains in the county.  I will not repeat what Deputy Kenny said but the escort service is vital.  I understand there is a pilot scheme in Dublin and ask for it be extended to County Mayo.  I take this opportunity to compliment the drivers who have brought these children to and from school safely over the years. Recently, there was a tragic accident in another part of the country.  I spoke on the radio many weeks before that and I wrote to the Minister saying an accident was waiting to happen in relation to this problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny is right when he says these are special children with special needs.  Parents have a difficult time coping with these difficult children. They love them very much and want them to get whatever education is available.  Now bus operators are threatening to stop this service from December if escorts are not provided.  That would be unfair to the children and the parents, and it is wrong for the Department not to honour its commitment to treat all children equally. These are special cases.  The Department of Finance is flush with money and there is a need here for a little of that money.  I do not believe a Minister, official or anybody would say this money would not be well spent on the people with these disabilities.  There are people in place who were trained under the FÁS scheme and who have worked with those involved for the past number of years.  However, the schools will lose a supply of workers because the FÁS scheme is to be terminated.  However, at present there are people available to take up the jobs if the Department is prepared to provide the money.  We got away with a warning recently.  Will the Minister do whatever is necessary to deal with this problem?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for the compelling case he made, ably supported by Deputy Ring.  I recently became aware of the particular difficulties that have arisen on the school transport service to which the Deputies refer.  Child care workers were provided to act as escorts on certain services facilitating St. Anthony's and St. Brid's special schools in Castlebar under a FÁS scheme.  A recent reduction in the number of hours under the scheme which resulted in the services being unsupervised for three days per week has created problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> I understand the situation may be further compounded in December when the FÁS scheme is due to terminate.  I am very much aware of the need to extend the existing escort scheme on special school transport services.  I am currently giving active consideration to possible measures in this regard.  The overall operation of the school transport scheme is constantly under review to ensure the best and safest service is delivered. Bus Éireann, which operates the service on behalf of my Department, places special emphasis on safety and to this end has a wide range of checking procedures in place to ensure a safe and reliable service.  However, I am aware difficulties arise from time to time in regard to special needs pupils on some services.</P>
    <P>Since 1995 an annual allocation of £150,000 has been provided to fund a pilot scheme of grant aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services.  All applications for support under the scheme are carefully considered by my Department.  It was decided that the pilot scheme should focus on facilitating the appointment of escorts and services to special schools for children with physical disabilities and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.  These schools are located in Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> The Deputies will be aware that the school transport review committee undertook a very comprehensive study of the entire school transport scheme.  The committee's report, published in January 1998, was circulated to all relevant and interested parties for their views.  The recommendations set out in the report deal with a broad range of transport issues, including the questions of escorts and special services.  The report estimates the cost of providing all special transport services will be in the order of £2 million per annum.  The content of the report has given rise to extensive debate and a number of responses have been received.  These are currently under examination in my Department.  The outcome of this consideration will provide the basis for determining future approaches to the question of escorts and school services.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Deputies have raised a number of issues concerning transport provision for special needs children travelling to special schools from the Mayo area.

      <P>REPS has been revised recently to include new provisions for the conservation of natural heritage areas including SACs, and commonage areas.  This revision was approved by the EU Commission on 6 August 1998.</P>
      <P>The new measure entitled supplementary measure A replaces the existing supplementary measures 1 and 2 which deal with NHAs and commonages.  For NHAs and SACs, excluding commonages, participants will be required to farm in accordance with agreed conditions for those areas.  Where commonage land is included in the NHA and SAC, a framework plan must be drawn up under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Planners are currently being trained in the drawing up of these framwork plans and steps are being taken to facilitate the earliest possible participation of farmers in the new measure, allowing them to avail of the increased payments for these areas.</P>
      <P>As a result of the new provisions, the REP scheme document and the detailed agri-environmental specifications have had to be amended. This work is progressing and I expect the revised documents to be published within a few weeks when the new provisions can be put in place.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, existing REPS participants with land in an SAC area can continue with their existing plans up to the year 2000 and there are no delays in making payments to them.  New applicants or existing participants who wish to avail of the new measure, including the higher increased payments, must submit a new REPS five year plan and comply with the conditions as set out in the new measure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 86 and 106 together.</P>
      <P>From the investigations undertaken in relation to the November 1997 incident, my Department was satisfied that the cattle in question were imported from the United Kingdom in contravention of EU veterinary legislation, as transposed into Irish law.  Consequently and in accordance with the established policy, the cattle were slaughtered, the carcasses were rendered and the resulting material was subsequently exported for incineration.</P>
      <P>The precise origin of these cattle in the United Kingdom has not been definitely established but it is believed that they came here from Northern Ireland.  A slaughter notice was served on the owner of the cattle.  The matter is still under investigation and my Department is most anxious that legal proceedings would be taken against those involved with this illegal importation if it is possible to sustain a case.</P>
      <P>The audit in March was conducted by the EU food and veterinary office and followed a new audit format which was introduced in early 1998 by the EU Commission.  Following on from this, operating controls at the plant were reviewed by officers of my Department and were revised and amended in the context of the demands of the new audit format.</P>

      <P>The position is that the scheme of early retirement from farming is being implemented under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2079/79.  It is a requirement of that regulation that the amount payable by way of the early retirement pension together with any national retirement pension cannot exceed the maximum which would be payable under the early retirement scheme.  In other words, on qualifying for a national retirement pension, which includes a contributory old age pension, at age 66, the amount of the early retirement pension is reduced by the amount of the national retirement pension.</P>

      <P>Poultry, beef and pork products are imported into Ireland under EU harmonised rules.  Products imported from other member states must come from establishments which comply with the standards of production and hygiene laid down in EU directives and which have been approved by the competent authority of the exporting member state.  Products from countries outside the EU may be imported only from countries and establishments which are approved by the EU Commission for export to the Community and must enter the Community through approved border inspection posts.  In practice, products are not allowed from regions or countries in which there has been a disease outbreak which poses a risk to animal or public health.</P>
      <P>Importers of meat and poultry products are required by law to provide advance notice of each consignment to my Department and my Department maintains a register of all importers of animal products.  All such consignments entering Ireland must be accompanied by health certification or other documentation required by EU legislation.  Such consignments are subject to inspection by authorised officers of my Department or by the Customs Authorities and the Garda Síochána.  In addition, inspectors of my Department frequently carry out inspections of consignments at entry and/or at destination to ensure that they comply with EU and national rules.  Any products which are found to be not in compliance with the import regulations are either refused entry, detained and/or destroyed.</P>

      <P>The recent outbreaks of salmonella poisoning were the cause of grave concern.  Where raw eggs were found to be the source of the poisoning every effort was made to trace those eggs. In those cases where the origin of the eggs was traced they were found to have been produced in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following the outbreaks, my Department held meetings with the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland to discuss safety measures for eggs and in particular to seek assurances that exports of eggs to this jurisdiction would only be allowed from flocks that are free of salmonella enteritidis and salmonella typhimurium.</P>
      <P>In addition my Department has consulted with representatives of the major retailers, caterers and hoteliers to advise them on sensible practices with regard to their sourcing of eggs, traceability and guarantees on the laying flocks of origin.  This work has complemented the work of the Food Safety Authority in advising the consumer on the safety of eggs.  Close liaison has been maintained with the Food Safety Authority on this issue.</P>
      <P>It should not be forgotten that Ireland has one of the best track records for salmonella in the European Union.  This country's controls exceed those required under EU law and Ireland is one of only four member states with approved national plans for salmonella.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the scientific report referred to. Animal health problems in the Askeaton area of County Limerick have been the subject of an ongoing major multidisciplinary scientific investigation, co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency.  To date, three interim and seven progress reports, detailing the progress of the investigation, have been published by the EPA.</P>
      <P>My Department is part of this investigation and has been monitoring animal health, mainly on cattle, on six farms in the Askeaton area since 1995.  One of these farms, which has been managed by my Department since 1995, adjoins the farm on which the horses referred to in the recent report were kept.  Throughout this period no evidence was found of disease conditions which could be ascribed to aluminium toxicity, either through the parasite mechanism being put forward by the report or the more usual one of induced phosphorus deficiency.  Investigations carried out on a further 21 farms in the area have not shown any evidence that aluminium toxicity was the cause of animal ill-health or disease.</P>
      <P>My Department takes the view that the condition reported in horses on one particular farm and its suggested association with tissue aluminium is a significant finding which warrants further investigation, particularly since the aluminium content of soils in the Askeaton area was found during the EPA investigation to be within the normal range for agricultural soils elsewhere in Ireland.  However, for the past two years my Department has been unsuccessful in repeated attempts to have the owner of the farm in question co-operate with the multidisciplinary investigation and has been denied access to the farm and the animals on it.  In 1995, veterinary staff of my Department did visit the farm in question and, as a result of its investigations, a number of disease conditions were diagnosed and recommendations were made in relation to parasite control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repeated offers by my Department in 1996 and 1997 to further investigate animal health problems on the farm were rejected, as was an offer to include the farm in a two year study of animal health commencing in 1996.  Further, at a meeting with my officials in May 1997, the horse owner and his veterinary adviser, the principal author of the report, refused a request from my Department for any information in their possession on animal health problems on the farm for inclusion in a general investigation.  There has been a consistent desire on the part of both the EPA, as co-ordinators of the multidisciplinary study, and my Department, as the agency dealing with veterinary <Col N="1034" /> aspects thereof, to include this farm in the investigation.</P>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the statement issued on 2 October 1998 by the EPA, as co-ordinators of the multdisciplinary investigation.  I draw particular attention to the following passage contained therein; &ldquo;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today emphasised that a reported connection between disease and deaths of horses on a farm at Askeaton and acid pollution is not substantiated by the published results of the animal health investigations being conducted in the area since 1995.  They reject the inferences and speculative comments in relation to a recent study on this problem as published by a Sunday paper last week, on the basis that there was no evidence to support these theories&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am still anxious to mount a full scale investigation into the factors on the farm in question which may have contributed to the high level of horse mortality.  While such mortality is being attributed to aluminium poisoning, the fact remains that I can form no reliable assessment of the causal factors without access to the horse farm in question, its animals and its records.</P>
    <P>The Mid-Western Health Board, one of the agencies involved in the multidisciplinary investigation, has found no evidence to date of excess human disease in the area which could be linked to aluminium.</P>

      <P>The Commission's detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy were published on 18 March 1998.  A special meeting of the Council of Ministers was convened on 31 March 1998 to enable Ministers to put forward their initial reactions to the proposals.  At that meeting, I informed the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council of the economic significance of the Irish interests that would be affected by the proposals and told them that the proposals were seriously damaging to Irish agriculture and the Irish economy and that, consequently, Ireland rejected them in their present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A preliminary technical examination of the proposals was carried out over the following two months and the proposals were again discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on 25-26 May, when a progress report was prepared for the European Council in Cardiff on 15-16 June.  The report contained an undertaking that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account.  That undertaking was in response to my request that the importance of beef and milk to the Irish economy <Col N="1035" /> should be acknowledged.  The report included, also at my request, a recognition of the need to avoid renationalisaltion of the CAP and distortion of competition.</P>
    <P>These commitments were copperfastened by the Taoiseach at the European Council in Cardiff when the 15 Heads of Government agreed that further negotiations should be based on the conclusions reached by the May Council.</P>
    <P>The European Council set the objective of achieving final adoption of the overall Agenda 2000 proposals before the next European Parliament elections in June 1999 and specified that substantial progress should be made at the Vienna European Council on 11-12 December 1998 on the key elements of the package so that political agreement could be reached on the package as a whole no later than March 1999.  Technical examination of the proposals is continuing in preparation for the meetings of the Council of Ministers in October and November.  It is expected that the November meeting will make a further report to the European Council meeting to be held in Vienna on 11-12 December.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 229 and 242 together.</P>
      <P>I am well aware that some farmers are currently experiencing difficult times and every effort is being made to alleviate these difficulties. Many of the difficulties now being faced by some of the farming sectors arise from developments on the Russian market and the difficult weather of 1998.  I have been extremely active in trying to alleviate these difficulties and a range of measures have already been taken by me.</P>
      <P>These include speeding up direct payments to farmers; an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent which will release an additional £45 million in November and December; pigmeat export refunds have been increased in May and August and now an attractive scheme of aid to private storage for 70,000 tonnes has been introduced; more rapid payment of REPS where such payments are falling due; payment of outstanding top up of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October; arrangements for Teagasc to hold special free advisory clinics on fodder in the areas affected; promoting live exports and reopening trade with Libya; increased beef export refunds &mdash; equivalent to 5p per lb.  of beef &mdash; which was agreed by the Commission on 25 September 1998; ensuring that appropriate transport facilities are available for live exports of cattle and sheep; providing assistance towards the winter fodder shortage.</P>
      <P>The Government has introduced a new scheme and made £10 million available to deal with fodder difficulties and I expect that details of the new scheme will be available very shortly.  In relation to the beef market, I am continuing to make every effort to ensure unhindered access for Irish beef to markets world wide.  In that regard, I will be in Iran this week to discuss the reopening of beef trade there.  I will meet with my Iranian counterpart as well as with other senior ministers of the Iranian Government.</P>

    <P>While I accept that the current difficulties are severe, a comprehensive payments system is now in place and I believe that the industry has the capacity to overcome this current downturn in the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 102, 232 and 243 together.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties faced by Irish farmers arising from market difficulties and fodder shortages.  As far as cattle prices are concerned, the difficult situation stems almost entirely from the loss of the Russian market which accounted for approximately 25 per cent of our beef exports in 1997.  I made very strong representations to Commissioner Fischler about the situation and impressed on him the need for urgent action to provide relief to the market, in particular by way of an increase in export refunds.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that the Commission has responded to these representations by increasing export refunds on live cattle by 8 per cent and on boneless beef by 12 per cent.  The increase in the refunds on boneless beef is worth 5p/lb.  This increase will improve the competitiveness of Irish cattle and beef exports on third country markets and should enable our processors to pay higher prices for cattle to producers.  I also submitted a number of proposals to the Commission which include the need for an EU export credit facitity to trade with Russia and also a loosening of the intervention criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of competition in the market <Col N="1038" /> place in maintaining cattle prices at reasonable levels is also recognised and in view of this special attention has been devoted to the live trade.  I am pleased that these efforts have been successful in securing the re-opening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and shipping is expected to begin shortly.  Considerable progress has been made in securing shipping facilities and large numbers of weanlings have been exported to the Continent. I will be in Iran this week to discuss the possible re-opening of that market which has been closed to us since 1996 for BSE reasons.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that, in the context of the negotiations on the prices package earlier this year, the continuation of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium was secured.  This is a very important benefit to winter finishers.  The European Commission has also been persuaded to increase the rate of advance of the cattle premiums from 60 per cent to 80 per cent.  Payment of the advances at this high rate will enable my Department to pay an additional £45 million in premiums to cattle farmers this year and thereby improve the cash flow of all farmers.  In these circumstances, I do not think that an interest subsidy scheme is justified.</P>
    <P>As regards the fodder situation, last week I announced that the Government had agreed to make £10 million available to deal with winter fodder difficulties.  In addition, I announced that I had sought EU Commission approval to continue the sheep headage top up equivalent to £2.75 million.  The sheep headage top up will be paid on the basis of the normal applications already on hand in my Department.  The details on how the £10 million fund will be allocated are being finalised and the approval of the EU Commission will be sought as a matter of urgency.  The measure will be geared towards certain farms in the areas identified as worst affected by the weather.</P>

      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers introduced in 1994 under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry was suspended on 7 August 1997 when the available funding was exhausted. Recognising the importance attached to this measure by young farmers embarking on their careers, I secured the agreement of the Minister for Finance to the reintroduction of a more tightly focused revised scheme targeted towards those smaller farmers most in need of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions with the farming organisations on the nature of the new scheme, my Department submitted the terms of a revised installation aid scheme to the Department of Finance <Col N="1039" /> and to the European Commission for approval in late July.</P>
    <P>In mid-September the Commission raised questions about the proposal which provided for accommodating young farmers who failed to make application under the earlier scheme before its suspension subject, of course, to their meeting the relevant eligibility criteria.  The Commission also sought clarification that the equivalent skills and competence qualifications of other member states would be recognised in determining eligibility under the proposed scheme.  My Department has responded quickly on these issues to the Commission and again stressed my desire to secure the earliest agreement for the new measure.</P>

      <P>Some £167 million was made available under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry for the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes which has been fully utilised.  This includes additional funding of over £28.5 million allocated following the mid term review of the Structural Funds in July 1997, and a further £15.2 million made available from the national Exchequer in last year's Supplementary Estimate. Therefore, considerable additional funding has been made available for these measures, all of which will be used to cover existing commitments under the schemes.</P>
      <P>There are currently no funds available to restore these schemes.  However, I regard the schemes as high priority and I am continuing to pursue the question of funding to enable their reintroduction in a more focused way.</P>

      <P>A total of 334 animals which were determined to have been illegally imported from Northern Ireland have been seized to date in 1998.  Of these 157 have been slaughtered and rendered with the resulting material subsequently exported for incineration.  The rest of the animals <Col N="1040" /> are being held under Department control awaiting the results of forensic and other investigations.</P>
      <P>My Department has specific procedures in place at cattle slaughter plants to determine both the origin and health status of animals presented for slaughter.  These include: the checking of eartags and accompanying documentation by meat plant staff under the supervision of officers of the Department; physical inspection of the cattle identity card to reconcile the eartag information on the card with an eartag affixed to the individual animal and, in case of doubt, the eartag number and herd number data can be and are verified by reference to a computer data base, by entering the information on the PC in the veterinary office.</P>
      <P>The action taken where the data base query shows an anomaly or where, in the view of the veterinary officer in charge, there is cause for doubt or suspicion depends on the circumstances involved.  Officers of my Department, with the assistance of other enforcement agencies, carry out surveillance and inspections elsewhere to deter and detect illegal movement of cattle.  While use of silicone has been detected in a small number of cases, there is no evidence of its use on a widespread basis.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the measures in place at factories and other areas are providing adequate safeguards to ensure that the prohibition on the illegal importation of cattle is being properly enforced.  These measures will be further enhanced with the introduction of computerised monitoring of cattle movement.</P>

      <P>According to provisional figures provided by Teagasc, the number of students enrolled in the 11 agricultural colleges this autumn is down by 7.5 per cent to 860 from 930 in 1997.  This, however, is a much more modest reduction than had been predicted.  Indeed, the level of enrolments this year is quite encouraging, particularly when one considers the increased choices available to school leavers today in terms of job opportunities which were not there previously as well as the increasing numbers of places available in third level institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, of course, emphasise the importance of agricultural education and training for any young person who intends to take up farming. Continuing technological and economic change makes such training essential for a successful <Col N="1041" /> career in the demanding world of modern farming. There are significant financial advantages available from the State to young trained farmers. Relief from stamp duty on the transfer of agricultural land is provided to trained young farmers who meet certain conditions.  This applies both to gifts and sales and amounts to a reduction of two-thirds of the stamp duty which would otherwise be payable.  Young trained farmers can benefit under the special stock relief scheme and qualify for the transfer of land under the early retirement scheme for farmers.</P>
    <P>While there are many factors which may influence young people to embark on a career in farming, it is recognised that the financial assistance provided under the installation aid scheme has provided a significant incentive in this regard.  I have already dealt with this in replying to a separate question from the Deputy about the scheme.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has been made towards implementing the national beef assurance scheme, including the animal traceability elements.  Phase one of the computerised cattle movement monitoring system was introduced on 28 September last when 40 marts began recording details of cattle movements through their premises and when farmers and dealers began to make notifications about private sales.  As the year continues, the intention is to bring all remaining marts, meat plants and live export points into the system.</P>
      <P>Arrangments for the introduction of the wider national beef assurance scheme are also well advanced.  The texts of the standards to be applied by farms, meat plants, marts and others involved in the industry have been the subject of extensive consultation with industry partners over recent months.  Later this month, I expect to be in a position to present to Cabinet proposals for legislation to underpin the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the importance of the Russian market for Irish beef exports and, indeed, of the difficulties which the financial crisis in that country has created for the beef sector in Ireland. I have expressed my concern to Commissioner Fischler that the sale of intervention beef to Russia could undermine the commercial trading structures which have been built up between Irish and Russian traders in recent years and, accordingly, that it could delay the recovery of our former trade with that country.  I have made it clear to the Commissioner that our primary objective must be to protect the commercial trade in beef with Russia.</P>
      <P>On the specific question of the Commission's decision to release 85,000 tonnes of intervention stocks on to international markets, both I and my Department have made it clear to the Commission that the sale of this beef at the present time could have a negative impact on commercial trade and we have asked the Commission to adopt a cautious approach to such sales.  I should point out, however, that a substantial proportion of the beef offered for sale is restricted to central and eastern Europe where the EU has very little commercial trade at present and which, therefore, would have little impact on commercial trade.</P>

      <P>I am aware that figures provided to the Health and Safety Authority by the National Cancer Registry show an increase in recent years in the number of mesothelioma-related deaths.  There were ten such deaths in 1994 and 16 in 1995.  A full set of figures in not yet available for 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health and Safety Authority enforces legislation for the protection of workers from exposure to asbestos.  The specific regulations are entitled the European Communities (Protection <Col N="1047" /> of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989 and the European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) (Amendment) Regulations, 1993.  The Authority does not deal with asbestos disposal or asbestos in the general environment.</P>
    <P>In 1997 and again this year the Authority has concentrated on worker protection from exposure to asbestos.  In 1997 a total of 108 inspections involving asbestos were carried out and 22 improvement notices and four prohibition notices were served as a direct consequence of this action.  A minimum of 100 asbestos inspections are planned for 1998 and the main focus this year is on asbestos removal contractors.  Numerous improvement notices and prohibition notices have been served to date in 1998 as part of this work.</P>
    <P>At its meeting on 7 April 1998 the Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs adopted Council conclusions on the protection of workers against risks from exposure to asbestos.  Ireland strongly supported these conclusions which state that the highest risks from asbestos exposure are now faced by workers involved in the removal of asbestos and by workers who encounter asbestos incidentally to their work, for example, construction workers, demolition workers and tradespersons who inadvertently disturb asbestos in the course of their work.  The conclusions specify preventive actions which would help to further protect these groups of workers.  Such actions include higher standards of worker protection, competence and training of workers.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has indicated that it will act on these Council conclusions and Ireland will be very supportive of any resulting proposals which will achieve an improvement in worker protection from exposure to asbestos.</P>

      <P>I informed the Deputy on 28 April 1998 of the reason Ireland was required to withdraw IS 310. Implicit in IS 310 was a requirement that organisations must comply with all legal environmental regulations; under ISO 14001, there is an explicit commitment to comply with such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ISO standards are archieved through consensus which is not an easy thing to achieve, especially at an international level.  However, each standard uses the same broad approach and has an in-built improvement imperative.  This must be viewed in <Col N="1048" /> the context that there is no obligation on organisations to be certified to any of these standards. Certification to these systems is voluntary and is a demonstration of an organisation's commitment to integrate environmental considerations into all aspects of the management of its operations.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the staffing and financial resources available to the LES are sufficient to enable it to carry out its role.</P>
      <P>For this year, 1998, my Department has a total of £9.3 million available for the operation of the current 18 local employment service networks. Some of the local partnership companies have also contributed funding to the LES.  Certain Government Departments and agencies have also made resources, in particular staff, available to the LES.  At present there are over 250 staff employed in the LES networks which represents a considerable resource dedicated to the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Each LES submits an annual budget request to my Department and this is discussed in detail between the two parties.  A budget proposal is then put to an interdepartmental advisory group for final approval.  There is, therefore, a consultative process involved in allocating resources to the individual LES areas.</P>
      <P>The LES is providing an important locally based service to the unemployed with a range of features which have made the LES so attractive to many people.  It has developed links between the State agencies providing services to the unemployed. It has also developed links with employers in their localities.  I acknowledge, however, that the recent report from Eustace Patterson evaluating the LES recommended that further action was needed in certain locations on these two fronts.  My Department will follow up on this report with the LES networks.</P>
      <P>To date, the LES has engaged with 25,800 people.  Almost 20,000 clients are currently placed in jobs or active on some form of progression path towards employment.</P>
      <P>I announced, on 26 September 1998, the expansion of the LES to seven new areas, namely Bray, southside, canal communities in Dublin, Galway city, Monaghan, Tralee and Waterford city.  For 1999, in the multi-annual Estimates, a total of £14 million is earmarked for the operation of the expanded LES.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> It is important to make the point that the LES comprises just one strand of our dual-stranded national employment service, with the second strand being provided through FÁS, which has 400 people engaged in this function.  In the year to date, for example, the FÁS employment service has handled 64,000 newly registered clients and is known to have placed almost 23,000 people in open market jobs and a further 25,000 have left the active job seekers' register to enter FÁS employment and training programmes.</P>
    <P>It is essential to ensure that both services develop and work in a co-ordinated and complementary fashion, particularly in the context of commitments made under the national employment action plan.  Discussions are currently taking place with relevant interests with a view to ensuring that we put in place the most appropriate structural arrangements to achieve those objectives.</P>

      <P>Assessment by insurance companies in respect of applicants for motor insurance is a matter for each individual insurance company based on its underwriting experience.  Insurers contend that, on the basis of their underwriting experience, drivers with certain disabilities are likely to be a greater risk than average, and in particular when the disabled person is a learner or young inexperienced driver.  The number of prosecutions for road traffic offences is but one factor used by insurers in assessing the insurance risk.</P>

Following referral of the subject of disability loadings to the former Motor Insurance Advisory Board it was agreed that, provided the driver remained claims free, a maximum loading of 20 per cent disability loading would apply in the first year of insurance, this would decrease to 15 per cent in the second year of claims free insurance and no loading would apply thereafter provided the driver remained claims free.</P>
    <P>This arrangement is being operated by authorised motor insurers.  It does not apply, however, in the cases of degenerative illnesses and is subject to the insurers' right to call for a medical examination.  The Deputy may be aware that I recently reconstituted the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, and this is an area which could usefully be looked at by the new board.</P>
    <P>The present criteria used for assessing disabled drivers as an insurance risk is a considerable improvement on that which previously applied. Prior to the introduction of the current system, loadings ranged from 10 per cent to 150 per cent, depending on the insurer in question and the nature of the disability.</P>
    <P>The Department is not aware of any major problems concerning the current loading system. Nevertheless, the Irish Insurance Federation has agreed to look at individual cases where the foregoing arrangement has not been observed.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities and I have impressed upon the industrial development agencies the importance of making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the regions.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is actively pursuing a strategy to increase employment in County Laois.  As part of the agency's marketing efforts to enhance the attractiveness of the county for inward investors, it entered into a land swap with Laois County Council in 1997.  This resulted in the establishment of a new 45 acre business and industrial park by IDA Ireland on the Mountrath road.  At the end of 1997, IDA Ireland invested approximately £500,000 for the provision of the necessary services and landscaping to enable the park to be established as a quality location to compete for overseas mobile investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1052" /> At the same time, IDA Ireland issued a BES certificate to private developers for the construction of a 20,000 sq.  ft.  unit at the park.  Due to planning objections locally, construction of this unit was delayed.  In August 1998, the Planning Appeal Board gave a positive decision enabling the developers to proceed and it is now expected that construction of the new facility will commence in October 1998.  The availability of such an advance factory facility is critical to IDA Ireland's marketing programme for inward investment to the area.</P>
    <P>With this new facility coming on stream in early 1999, IDA Ireland will concentrate its efforts on securing a client for County Laois at the earliest possible stage.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the Pretty Polly site in Killarney is that IDA Ireland was in discussions for some time with a US company which had shown a strong interest in the site.  However, the company has since decided to locate its project elewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland has, however, been successful in securing another project for Killarney &mdash; the US company, Rosenbluth International.  Rosenbluth announced its intention to open an advanced reservation call centre &mdash; IntelliCentre &mdash; which will create 250 new jobs in Killarney when fully developed.  Rosenbluth is currently using a portion of the Pretty Polly building as temporary accommodation.  The company is planning to convert the former Kerry Glass building with a view to taking up occupancy.  I understand that Rosenbluth <Col N="1053" /> has recruited its first 30 employees and training has now commenced.</P>
    <P>The attraction of this prestigious call centre for Killarney continues the regional dispersal trend for teleservices projects and provides job opportunities and new skills for young people in Killarney and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland continues to prioritise and highlight the Pretty Polly facility to mobile overseas investors and there have been a number of site visits to the facility to date in 1998.</P>

      <P>The US missile attack on the Al Shifa chemical plant near Khartoum on 20 August, together with the simultaneous attack on a target in Afghanistan, was clearly a response to the attacks on the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam which resulted in the deaths of 263 people.  At the time, the US indicated that it had acted upon credible and compelling evidence identifying those who had perpetrated the embassy bombings and that those individuals were planning further attacks.</P>
      <P>Since the missile attack on Sudan, there has been questioning of the basis for that decision, including the evidence available to the US that the targeted plant was engaged in producing chemical weapons.  Following a request by Sudan to the Security Council and the involvement of a number of other states in the region, informal consultations have taken place in New York on the possible tabling of a draft resolution requesting the UN Secretary General to dispatch a fact finding mission to Sudan to study whether the Al Shifa factory was involved in the production of chemical weapons ingredients and whether any links exist between the factory and the Usama bin Laden terrorist network. These consultations have not yet concluded and the draft resolution has not been formally tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With our EU partners, Ireland views the fight against terrorism as one of the priority aims of our common foreign policy.  To be effective, that fight requires maximum international co-operation and confidence between governments to ensure that those responsible for terrorist acts are brought to justice.  We have noted that the US stated to the UN Security Council that additional information would be provided on the background to the attacks.  We welcome the fact that informal consultations involving members of the UN Security Council, with Sudan and other governments, regarding the basis for the missile attack are continuing.  It is important that this issue be resolved between the United States and Sudan in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter and of international justice and in a <Col N="1057" /> manner which will contribute to the fight against international terrorism.</P>
    <P>My discussions with US Administration officials and others during my visit to Washington on 24 September related exclusively to recent developments in the Northern Ireland peace process. However, in my address to the UN General Assembly on 23 September, I did draw attention to developments in Sudan in the light of my own recent visit to that country.</P>

I am informed that there have been outbreaks of mustard oil contamination in recent years, for example in Calcutta in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1998 some 50 people died and over 1,850 people were taken ill in New Delhi, India as a result of the adulteration of mustard oil, which is a commonly used cooking ingredient, particularly in north and north eastern India, with argemone seeds.  As a result, in late August, the sale of mustard oil was banned in over a dozen Indian states, including Delhi, under the 1954 Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.  It has been reported in the Indian press that a number of <Col N="1058" /> manufacturers of various mustard oil brands have been arrested following investigations which also involved the police and autonomous research bodies.  More stringent enforcement of the legislation to prevent food adulteration is likely in the future.  I understand that the ban on the sale of mustard oil has already been relaxed in New Delhi.</P>
    <P>The documentation supplied by the Deputy contains a suggestion that in this instance the adulteration of mustard oil was deliberate rather than accidential.  However, the information available to me and indeed the document itself does not offer any evidence of a deliberate act.</P>

      <P>The Government holds both the person and office of the Dalai Lama in the highest regard and considers him to be a significant force for moderation in present circumstances.  I believe that the proposals which he has put forward are reasonable and I hope that they will be given serious consideration by the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>During my visit to the People's Republic of China last February, I urged the then Chinese Foreign Minister to enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama without preconditions as the best means of protecting the human rights of the Tibetan people and of achieving a peaceful settlement to the issue of Tibet.  The Taoiseach took a similar approach with Premier Zhu Rongji in the course of his visit to China last month.</P>

      <P>At local level, ideas outlined in the White Paper are being introduced in Dublin as the strategy identified by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is implemented.

    <P>The DTO short-term action plan has also identified a requirement for 100 extra buses and the need for additional State subvention to support expanded peak hour bus services.  These recommendations will be considered by Government as part of the Estimates process.</P>

      <P>The forecast mentioned by the Deputy that Internet telephony may account for 99 per cent of the total telephony market within five years is optimistic in my view at this time.  In fact, the rapid recent growth in mobile telephony globally suggests that mobile technology may well become the dominant mode for voice telephony in the medium to long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, with the increasing proliferation of digital applicances such as personal computers and the expanding rate of technical innovation, there is no doubt that Internet telephony <Col N="1063" /> can play a significant role in the global communications market in the near future.</P>
    <P>The extent to which Internet telephony will substitute for traditional telephony is highly uncertain.  Internet telephony began in 1995 and should still be regarded as being in development stage.  Its principal advantage over traditional telephony is that it provides voice connection for the same price as a data transmission over the Internet.</P>
    <P>However, while cheaper than traditional telephony, it still provides a lower standard service in terms of voice quality, turnaround time and general ease of use.  The actual cost of Internet telephony depends entirely on the nature of a given user's connection to the Internet.  In the case of dedicated access, such as a leased line, the marginal cost of an Internet telephone call is zero while in the case of a dial-up access over the traditional telephone network, the cost is equivalent to the local Internet access dial-up charge.</P>

It is regarded internationally as offering the possibility of generating electricity in a way which would avoid the unacceptable aspects of nuclear fission.  If the <Col N="1064" /> technology is developed successfully, there would be no risk of serious accidents affecting the environment and no significant volumes of radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>The EU's Fifth Framework Programme on Research includes a &ldquo;key action&rdquo; on controlled thermonuclear fusion.  This &ldquo;key action&rdquo; would make further progress on the development of an experimental reactor.  The &ldquo;key action&rdquo; would also investigate the contribution of fusion to safe and clean base-load electricity generation with due regard to the socio-economic aspects of fusion.</P>
      <P>The Fifth Framework Programme is funded from within the overall Community budget and there is no direct financial contribution by Ireland to the programme.  The budget for the &ldquo;key action&rdquo; has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Ireland takes the view that there is need to evaluate fusion research expenditure continuously in the light of deemed socio-economic benefits and the development costs involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of information on Sellafield's nuclear waste reprocessing contracts and their value is concerned, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 108 and 110 of the 28 April 1998.  While I do not have any such information in regard to these contracts, I wish to reassure the Deputy that the Government will continue to make known its opposition to the reprocessing operations at the Sellafield THORP plant through direct representations with the UK authorities and within international fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of contact with the German Government in regard to shipments of nuclear waste to Sellafield, I again refer the Deputy to my response to Questions Nos. 108 and 110 of 28 April 1998 and also to my response to Questions Nos. 23 and 28 of 3 June 1998.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has been monitoring developments in Germany following from the <Col N="1065" /> suspension in May 1998 of all shipments of nuclear waste from Germany.  These shipments had been suspended at the direction of the German Government after it emerged that the surface of nuclear waste containers arriving at the reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield from Germany were found to be contaminated.</P>
    <P>I understand that this suspension is still in place.  Clearly with the formation of a new Government in Germany the issue of the transport of nuclear waste will be under review.  My Department, with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs, will keep in touch with developments in Germany in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 107 of 28 April 1998.  Both my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; were in contact with the British authorities on this matter.</P>
      <P>The radioactivity contamination occurred in feral pigeons living close to the Sellafield plant. These pigeons are highly territorial and are, therefore, unlikely to migrate any great distance. Furthermore, this type of pigeon is not normally consumed by the public.  I understand that, on the basis of a detailed survey carried out by the British authorities, it appears that only one flock of birds was contaminated and that a cull was carried out of this flock by the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in my reply of 28 April 1998, the RPII carried out a radioactivity measurement of Irish pigeons, as a result of which no detectable levels of radioactivity were observed.  Accordingly, while the contamination of these birds highlights further the risks associated with the Sellafield plant, there is nothing to indicate that the contamination which occurred in these birds <Col N="1066" /> near Sellafield should be a matter of concern to Ireland.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; that there is considerable research and development on the use of robots in hostile environments for the protection of workers and others, with many of these robots being designed for specific functions including work in highly radioactive environments.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the RPII that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd.  has recently developed a robot which will be used to facilitate the decommissioning of the highly radioactive caesium extraction plant, CEP, at Sellafield.  The CEP was constructed in 1955 to produce radiotherapy sources and operated until 1958 when it was placed on a care and maintenance basis.  It consists of four highly contaminated cells containing a variety of chemical equipment.  This decommissioning is due to commence in 1999 and will remove all highly contaminated structures, plant and equipment, leaving only low levels of radioactivity.  Decommissioning is expected to be completed in four years and will not, I am assured by the RPII, pose any risk to the health and safety of the public in Ireland.</P>
      <P>BNFL has plans also to develop robots for other decommissioning activities at Sellafield, including decommissioning of the damaged Windscale reactor pile.  It is the view of the RPII that the development and use of robots in radioactive environments should be encouraged on the basis that it will contribute to the safety of workers and will assist in the decommissioning of old disused plants at Sellafield.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 800 active substances contained in different pesticide preparations in the European Union.  In Ireland products containing approximately 450 active substances are marketed and used as pesticides. The nature of many of those pesticide preparations, their uses and manner of use are such that there is not a potential for residual traces to remain in food.</P>
      <P>To date maximum residue levels, MRLs, have been established for some 130 active substances. Ireland together with other member states of the EU has embarked upon a review of all existing active substances.  When this review is completed, MRLs will have been established for all active substances for which there are used on food crops.</P>
      <P>The European Community regulatory system for plant protection products, which in this country is operated by my Department's pesticide control service, restricts the application rates of pesticide produces to the minimum effective dose rates.

If plant protection products are used in accordance with the approved label institutions, workers and bystanders would not be a risk as a result of airborne contamination nor would unacceptable residues occur in food produce.</P>
      <P>The pesticide control service operates an enforcement programme to ensure that the pesticides being placed on the market are packaged and labelled correctly and a national pesticide monitoring and enforcement programme to ensure that pesticide residues in food do not exceed the maximum residue limits established in statutory regulations.</P>

      <P>The comprehensive measures to alleviate the current difficulties being experienced by the farming sector and the livestock industry in particular were fully outlined in my response to the Private Members' motion on the subject in this House on Wednesday last.  As the Deputy will know, the measures include the provision of £10 million to deal with fodder shortage occasioned by the inclement harvesting conditions in some areas of the country, rapid payment of direct premia and, in the case of the suckler cow and special beef premium, an increase in the advance payment to 80 per cent.  In tandem with these measures, my Department in conjunction with An Bord Bia is currently pursuing all possible means of securing viable markets for Irish meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1072" /> A measure of the success achieved by the board in accessing markets abroad is reflected in the fact that Irish food and drink exports grew by over 3 per cent in 1997 with earnings of almost IR£4.9 billion.  Notwithstanding these successes, the board is very much aware of the challenges facing the meat sector and has adopted strategies to meet these challenges.  Given the board's track record, I am satisfied that, with the co-operation of the various interests involved in the meat industry, these strategies will prove successful. For my part, I will endeavour to ensure that the board continues to be adequately resourced.</P>

      <P>Under the 1998 cattle headage-beef cow schemes, friesian cows and other non-beef breeds <Col N="1073" /> are no longer eligible for the high rate of £84-£75 per cow.  While non-beef breed cows are however eligible for the low rate of cattle headage grant which is £40-£33 per cow in the more severely handicapped areas, they are not eligible for any grant under the 1998 beef cow scheme in the less severely handicapped areas.</P>
      <P>The person named applied on 24 cows under the 1998 beef cow scheme.  At an inspection carried out on 6 August 1998, 23 cows were found to be non-beef breeds and consequently are ineligible for any grant under that scheme.  In accordance with clause 6 of the terms and conditions governing the 1998 beef cow scheme, which defines a &ldquo;beef cow&rdquo; as a cow which belongs to a meat breed or is born of a cross with a meat breed, and clause 29 of the terms and conditions which states that a producer who is deemed to have made a false declaration in his application through serious negligence will be excluded from the 1998 beef cow scheme, no grants are payable to the person named.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no specific rules governing the treatment of animals used in the making of films.  The principal statutes governing the protection of animals, domestic or wild, in this country are the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965. Enforcement of this legislation is a matter for the <Col N="1074" /> Garda.  The penalties for cruelty to animals under the 1911 Act were significantly increased in 1996. The penalties now are a fine of up to £1,500 and-or two years imprisonment on summary conviction and a fine of up to £10,000 and-or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>I believe that these tougher measures will act as a greater deterrent against acts of cruelty to all animals.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2079/92 under which the scheme of early retirement from farming is being implemented specifies certain mandatory conditions which must be included in the scheme.  One of these conditions provides that the minimum size of the holding to be transferred to an eligible transferee is five hectares of utilisable agricultural area.  The rate of annual pension is set at a basic 4,000 ECUs plus 250 ECUs per hectare up to a maximum of 10,000 ECUs which is payable on a farm of 24 hectares or over.  This is to allow for a relationship between the retirement pension and the amount of income which would have been generated from the farm holding.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to review this aspect of the current scheme.</P>

While the person concerned maintains that he still has an animal bearing the tag number in his possession, his ten month application was supported by a replacement cattle identity card.  The circumstances surrounding the whereabouts of the original card and the ten and 22 month applications submitted by the other two herdowners are currently under investigation.

      <P>The person concerned submitted an application for ten month special beef premium in respect of 49 animals on 7 May 1998.  During the course of an on-farm inspection two of the animals listed on the application were discovered to be female resulting in the exclusion of the applicant from the special beef premium scheme for one year.  The producer concerned has appealed this exclusion to the district inspector who is currently reviewing the appeal.  Depending on the outcome the person concerned will have the option of having his case independently reviewed by the Headage and Premia Appeals Unit.</P>

    <P>In 1997 the producer concerned declared a forage area of 5.91 hectares.  Based on the above his stocking density for 1997 was 1.52 LUs per hectare i.e. 9.0 divided by 5.91. Consequently he has exceeded the qualifying threshold for extensification.</P>
    <P>The onus clearly lies with each herdowner to calculate his/her own individual stocking density. Extensification premium is a fully funded EU scheme and is governed by the relevant EU Rules and Regulations.  This Department has no leeway in either their interpretation or application.  The limit of less than 1.4 reckonable livestock units per hectare is stipulated in these Regulations and must be adhered to in order to qualify for payment of extensification premium.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package (which was paid out in October 1996) provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  Money had to be recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>The person named had 12 more eligible animals under the 1996 special beef premium scheme and 15 additional cows qualifying under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme.  He is therefore entitled to BSE top-up payment on these animals.  Payment will be made within the next two weeks.</P>

      <P>The position is that the EU suckler cow premium scheme is available to all suckler cow producers in Ireland.  The current payment rate is £140.23 per eligible cow subject to an individual quota limit.  In addition, suckler cow farmers in the more severely disadvantaged areas are entitled to a payment of £84 per suckler cow under the disadvantaged areas' cattle headage scheme.  They are also entitled to headage grants on other animals.  Producers in less severely disadvantaged areas are entitled to a payment of £75 per suckler cow under the disadvantaged areas beef cow scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199, 214 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the problems being experienced by drystock producers arising in particular from the market difficulties.  In the course of the last month, I made strong representations to the Commission for the introduction of more effective market and income support arrangements.  I am pleased that the Commission has responded speedily to these representations.  The recent increase in export refunds, combined with the re-opening of Libya for live cattle, should help to improve the situation.  In addition, the increase in the advance of the cattle premiums from 60 per cent to 80 per cent will enable my Department to pay an additional £45 million in premiums to farmers this year and this should help to improve the cash flow of drystock producers.  The retention of the deseasonalisation slaughter premium for 1999 will also be of particular benefit to drystock producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Agenda 2000, the Commission's proposals provide for the reduction of beef prices by 30 per cent and for compensation to be paid to farmers through increases in the direct payments. The intention is that 50 per cent of the compensation will be provided through increases in the suckler cow and special beef premiums with the balance coming through a national envelope system in order to enable member <Col N="1085" /> states better to target the compensation on those beef producers who are not adequately catered for by the existing premium system.  Under these proposals, it will be possible for drystock producers to qualify both for the standard premiums and for payments from the national envelope in respect of their suckler cows and male cattle.  The proposals also provide for heifers of beef breeds over eight months of age to qualify for headage payments from the national envelope.</P>
    <P>I should point out that negotiations on the Commission's proposals are at an early stage and will take some time to complete.  I am conscious of the particular concerns of drystock producers and I will spare no effort in seeking to ensure that they are taken into account in any final settlement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the special beef premium should be changed to cover both male and female animals from birth, such a change would require an amendment to EU Council Regulation 805/68 based on a proposal from the Commission.  At present there is no such proposal from the Commission.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that such a change would have very substantial budgetary implications, in particular in view of the fact that calves reared for veal production would qualify for the premium.  As explained above, the Commission intends that heifers of beef breeds over eight months of age will qualify for headage payments under the national envelope system which has been proposed in the context of Agenda 2000.</P>

      <P>The retention period under the suckler cow premium scheme is set out in a Council Regulation.  Producers who lodged their suckler cow applications in early May will have completed the retention period in early November. Varying the retention period, even on a once-off basis for 1998, would require the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  In the unlikely event that such agreement would be forthcoming it would involve a lengthy process involving the Commission making such a proposal to the Council.  Effectively therefore, any such agreement would not be obtained in time to benefit any reasonable number of producers this year.</P>
      <P>The recent decision of the Beef Management Committee to increase the rate of advance of the cattle premiums including the suckler cow premium, together with the fodder package which I announced last week, should improve the cash flow of producers and, accordingly, makes it less necessary to reduce the retention period for the suckler cow premium.</P>

      <P>A recent survey of applications approved under the scheme of early retirement from farming disclosed that 34 per cent of applications are approved within one month of receipt of a valid application, 66 per cent are approved within three months and 90 per cent are approved within seven months.  There are no figures available on the time lag between the date of application and the date of assessment.  However, the above statistics take this into account as part of the overall processing time.  The rate of approval of applications depends on the quality of the applications and the volume in any particular county. I would point out, however, that in no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer.  The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>
      <P>There are currently 385 applications being processed for entry into the scheme.</P>

      <P>The incidence of brucellosis and tuberculosis per county in 1998 (to the dates indicated) is shown in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The new arrangements for the TB and brucellosis eradication programmes introduced in 1996 are designed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the eradication schemes and provide for the orderly annual testing of the national herd and a comprehensive research programme.  In relation to the current brucellosis situation and in consultation with the Animal Health Forum a number of new measures were introduced to combat the disease: from 23 February 1998 all female cattle and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; from the same date, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test and such cattle being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding; a full round of blood testing for all eligible cattle in 1998 to augment and compliment existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing; revamped administrative procedures in my Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds; arrangements to speed up the completion of blood tests and the improved notification of results; early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities; increased epidemiology work by my Department's veterinary staff and a review of the epidemiology of brucellosis over recent years; an ongoing and intensive awareness/advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis; a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied following discussions in the Animal Health Forum that all concerned &mdash; farmers, the veterinary profession and marts will co-operate fully with these new arrangements.  The arrangements to be applied for both TB and brucellosis for 1999 are under consideration.</P>

      <P>Some £129 million has been made available under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry for the control of farm pollution scheme which has been fully utilised.  This includes additional funding of over £32 million provided since June 1997 of which £12.5 million is from National Exchequer funds.  The additional funding has been used to cover existing commitments under the scheme.</P>
      <P>There are currently no funds available to restore this scheme in 1998.  However, I regard the scheme as high priority and I am continuing to pursue the question of funding to enable its reintroduction in a more focused way.</P>

    <P>I have no proposals at present to introduce a buy-out scheme like the one in 1993 whereby farmers could buy-out their annuities at a discount of 50 per cent on the outstanding capital provided any arrears of repayments were also paid.</P>
    <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that Inspectors from my Department have been and still are visiting farmers who have arrears with a view to assessing the reasons for non-payment. If it is found that the annuity is excessive relative to the earning capacity of the farm and the family circumstances, it is intended to capitalise the arrears and to reduce the repayments to a more reasonable level which will result in an extension of the repayment period.  On the other hand if it is found that there is no good reason for non-payment of annuities my Department will consider pursuing legal avenues to effect payment.</P>

      <P>Nine dedicated livestock vessels have been approved for the export of cattle out of Ireland.  Two further vessels are under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> I am happy to state that there is adequate capacity available for live exports.  Commercial operators of roll-on/roll-off ferries, both Pandoro and Irish Ferries, are again carrying livestock to the Continent and this is being augmented by the carriage of large numbers of animals on dedicated vessels.  So far this year, about 90,000 cattle have gone to the Continent.  This is almost four times the number of cattle exported in all of 1997 and is headed towards twice the number exported in 1996.</P>
    <P>Cattle exports to the EU so far this year are already almost on a par with what was exported in 1995, which was a high point for the trade. Between 4,000 and 6,000 cattle a week have been exported to the Continent in recent weeks and it is expected that exports will continue at a high level.  On that basis, the 1998 export numbers to the Continent should be at the highest level in four years.  In addition, a further 16,500 cattle have been exported to the Lebanon this year and I expect that the Libyan trade will resume shortly.</P>

      <P>The Sub-Programme for the Development of the Food Industry 1994-99 provides a framework for the development of the food industry to the year 2000.  Its main focus is on increasing the competitiveness of the Irish food industry through investment in new technology, attainment of internationally acceptable quality standards, product and process development and innovation.  Particular attention is being paid to marketing of Irish food and drink products on the home and export markets while also targeting both retail and food service-catering operations.</P>
      <P>An Bord Bia's marketing strategy is implemented in detail by means of its annual programmes and takes account of on-going developments in the food industry.  These programmes encompass all aspects of food promotion and market development with appropriate focus on target markets and market segments, including liaison with the restaurant sector with which it undertakes appropriate activities on a regular basis.  In the restaurant and foodservice area, Bord Bia activities include specialist seminars, specialist publications, a Hotel and Restaurant guide and tailor-made restaurant promotions. Seminars highlighting the high and unique quality of Irish food are conducted for chefs, student chefs and visiting overseas chefs, the latter having been a particular feature of 1998.  A unique project launched recently was the special promotion with the Restaurant Association of Ireland to feature Irish mountain lamb &mdash; this promotion took place in 60 Eurotoque restaurants nation-wide.</P>

      <P>The complexity of EU regulations requires quite detailed application forms under all headage and premia schemes.  My Department has always endeavoured in consultation with the farming organisations, to simplify in so far as is possible application forms, help sheets, terms and conditions under each of the headage and premia schemes.</P>
      <P>All application forms are pre-printed with applicants name, address and herdnumber.  The 1998 area aid application form had pre-printed data which was submitted by the applicant in the previous year.  If there were no changes to the data, as printed, the herdowner was requested to tick a few questions and sign the application before returning it to the area aid unit.  Under the 1998 cattle headage and beef cow schemes farmers with untagged calves were advised to notify the Department of the position at application stage and to provide the tag numbers before 26 June 1998.  A special notification issued to farmers with their 1998 applications advising them of the changes in the qualifying criteria for a beef cow under the 1998 cattle headage-beef cow schemes.  Application forms, help sheets and check lists under these schemes and the suckler cow premium scheme were available from the end of April 1998 &mdash; over a month before the closing date to enable the farmer complete the form and have it lodged on time.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 29 May 1998 which was extended to 5 June due to the problems encountered by a number of farmers who wished to purchase cows to fill their suckler cow quota.</P>
      <P>Application forms were examined when lodged and any errors arising from initial system checking were notified to farmers through computer generated query letters under the 1998 cattle headage-beef cow and suckler cow premium schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the 1998 special beef premium scheme a ready reckoner under the old and new tagging system was incorporated in the application form to enable the farmer to calculate when his animal would become eligible for premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is normally the case, farmers were again assisted by local office staff when completing <Col N="1097" /> their 1998 application forms so as to minimise errors during the processing of applications.</P>
    <P>The whole process of trying to make all applications as user friendly as possible is an ongoing one and any valid recommendations which comply with the EU Regulations governing the schemes concerned, will be taken on board for the 1999 schemes.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the introduction, in October 1996, of a clawback on certain land and quota transfers was to encourage nonproducing quota holders to re-direct their quota away from private land transactions and to offer it instead to the restructuring or temporary leasing schemes.  The quota is then available to small scale producers who have first priority status under both schemes.</P>
      <P>Quota becoming available as a result of clawback is added to the national reserve and is allocated to small scale producers, free of charge, on hardship grounds.</P>
      <P>The operation of the clawback arrangements was reviewed in early 1998 and due to the very significant increase in land and quota transfers, the high price of the acquired quota and the subsequent consequences for the restructuring and temporary leasing schemes, the level of clawback was increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>Specific land transactions such as family transfers or renewals of existing arrangements are exempt from milk quota clawback.  I have requested the Milk Quota Review Group to review the operation of the milk quota regime in Ireland and the clawback mechanism is one of the areas which will be covered by that review.</P>

I also announced that I had sought EU Commission approval to continue the sheep headage top-up equivalent to £2.75 million.  The other measures taken include speeding up direct payments to farmers and an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent.  This will result in the release of an additional £45 million in November and December; more rapid payments of REPS where such payments are falling due; payment of outstanding BSE compensation top-ups of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October; arrangements for Teagasc to hold special free advisory clinics on fodder in the areas affected; promoting live exports and reopening trade with Libya; achieving a substantial increase in beef export refunds on 25 September &mdash; the increase is equivalent to 5p per pound of beef; and ensure appropriate transport facilities are available for live exports.</P>

      <P>The pigmeat industry is very important for the economy, with output valued at about £260 million in 1997, and its further development is a priority.  While the State can encourage investment decisions, ultimately such decisions are for the industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past decade or so the processing side of the industry has undergone considerable change and expansion.  Large scale investment in rationalisation and modernisation, supplemented by EU and Exchequer grant aid, has taken place. The latest investment came about last May when <Col N="1099" /> I announced details of EU and national support for five projects in the pigmeat sector.  The total investment will be £24.5 million and will create 266 jobs.  All involved significant progress towards increased added-value and better market returns for pigmeat.</P>
    <P>The pigmeat export market is experiencing difficulties at present due to international oversupply and weakness of market outlets.  I have taken action on this by seeking export refund increases and the reintroduction of EU funded private storage. These have been granted and should be of benefit to exporters of pigmeat.  As regards the longer term, I have set up a strategy group for the pig industry to examine all aspects of the Irish pig industry in the context of domestic, EU and international developments.  All sides of the industry are represented on the group and the combined expertise will be channelled into drawing up a strategy for the future development and prosperity of the industry.</P>

      <P>Some £242 million has been made available under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry for onfarm investment measures and this money has been fully committed.  This includes additional funding of over £44 million provided since June 1997, of which £16.2 million is from national Exchequer funds.  The additional funding has been largely used to cover existing commitments under the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes.</P>
      <P>While there are currently no funds available to restore these schemes, I regard them as high priority and I am continuing to pursue the question of funding to enable their reintroduction in a more focused way.  I have also identified onfarm capital investment as a priority measure in the proposals put forward to the Department of Finance for the next national development plan which is now being drafted for the new round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>Ireland exports approximately 70 per cent of all the sheepmeat produced in the country. France has been and will continue to be the main market for Irish lamb.  Over the past two years, the level of lamb consumption in France has been stagnant and there is increasing competition on the French market from the UK and New Zealand.  However, preliminary 1998 trade returns show Irish exports of lamb to France have increased by 8 per cent over 1997 levels.  This is a very creditable performance in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>Demand for lamb in Germany has expanded rapidly since the beginning of this decade.  Germany produces less than half of its own lamb requirements and Ireland has secured a satisfactory market share against increasingly difficult competition from New Zealand.  The southern EU member states, especially Italy and Portugal, which are net importers of sheepmeat, and Spain which has a high per capita consumption have been lucrative, if somewhat volatile outlets for lamb in the past and are likely to continue to be so in the future.</P>
      <P>In view of the increasingly stiff competition on all lamb export markets, it is evident that Irish exporters will be able to maintain or improve their market share only if greater attention is devoted to the production of high quality sheepmeat. I believe that the introduction of a lamb carcase classification scheme on a voluntary basis across all exporting plants from the end of this year is a prerequisite to achieving this objective.</P>

      <P>The current rate of excise duty for liquid petroleum gas, LPG, for automotive use is £56.75 per 1,000 litres compared to £256.14 per 1,000 litres for auto-diesel.  Bus and rail services benefit from a concessional rate for diesel of £17.90 per 1,000 litres.

    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> In considering the case for the promotion of clean technologies, I must have regard to the need to raise revenue on mineral oils and to the relevant EU directives which lay down harmonised minimum rates of excise for such products, including LPG.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works specifies only small quantities of tropical timber for specialist end use where temperate hardwoods cannot be used.  The office is seldom involved directly in their purchase as normally the contractor carrying out the work purchases the timber in accordance with the Office of Public Works's specification which states that such timbers &ldquo;must be from sustainable and managed plantations&rdquo;. The certification involved comes from the Government of the country of origin via the timber importer and building contractor.  The Office of Public Works endeavours to ensure that the &ldquo;paper trail&rdquo; is complete and vouched for by the timber importer.</P>

      <P>The basic purpose of Civil Service milage rates is to reimburse staff who are required to travel on official business in their own cars for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.  The rates are agreed with representatives of the staff side through the normal industrial relations procedures under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  The Civil Service rates are also used widely throughout the economy in both the public and private sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of when officers may be authorised to use their own cars for official purposes is entirely a matter for the individual Departments themselves having regard to their requirements and subject to compliance with the travelling and subsistence regulations.  Under the regulations, there is a general onus on Departments to properly plan travelling duties so as to reduce the total amount of travel to the minimum consistent with effectiveness and to ensure that official travel is <Col N="1103" /> by the shortest practicable routes and by the cheapest mode of conveyance.  No travelling expenses are payable in respect of any journey which covers all or part of an officer's usual route between home and headquarters.</P>
    <P>The regulations also distinguish between two categories of officer authorised to use their own cars on official business.  Officers assigned to field duties would frequently have to transport files and equipment to a variety of different locations in the course of their work thus making the use of their own cars essential for the efficient performance of those duties.  Officers other than those assigned to field duties, may be allowed to use their own cars on official business only where no suitable public transport is available, is available only at equal or greater expense or where the use of public transport would result in the loss of official time which it is necessary to avoid.</P>
    <P>Given the purpose of Civil Service mileage rates and the circumstances in which they are payable, I would doubt that a reduction in those rates would have the effect of encouraging the use of public transport.  Accordingly, I have no plans to reduce the mileage rates payable to civil servants who use their own cars for their official duties.</P>

      <P>The method of taxation of benefits-in-kind provided by employers for their employees is contained in section 118, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  The charge to tax arising on the employee is determined by the amount of the expense incurred by the employer in providing the benefit.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the provision of private car parking spaces would already be regarded as coming within the existing charge but, to the extent that the cost to an employer or the benefit to an employee is indeterminate, no taxable benefit would be considered to arise.  This would be the position where, for example, car parking spaces are included in the overall cost to the employer of office space or are for the use of both clients and employees.</P>

      <P>The tax code contains provisions which affect company <Col N="1105" /> cars in two areas: the taxation of the benefit to directors and employees derived from the private use of motor cars provided by their employers; the capital allowances and running expenses that are allowed for motor cars used for a business or employment.  The charge to tax on the benefit derived from the private use of a car is levied on a &ldquo;cash equivalent&rdquo; based on a specified percentage of the original market value of the car.  This percentage ranges from 18 per cent where the car only is supplied, to 30 per cent where, in addition to providing the car, the employer meets all running costs.  Tapering relief which reduces the cash equivalent is available where business miles exceed 15,000 a year.  An alternative relief, which reduces the cash equivalent by 20 per cent, is granted where specified conditions are met.</P>
      <P>The amount of capital allowances and the deduction for running expenses granted for tax purposes in respect of motor cars used in the course of a trade, profession or employment are granted by reference to a capital limit.  This limit currently stands at £15,500 for new cars.  Capital allowances for cars costing in excess of this amount are limited to what they would be if the car cost £15,500.  Running expenses are also restricted by means of a formula linked to that limit.  The limit is set approximately at the capital cost of a 1.6 litre car.  In so far as this limit restricts the amount which can be claimed, it favours small to medium size cars and discriminates against larger, more expensive and less environmentally friendly cars.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the fiscal regime outlined above constitutes an impediment to the objective of sustainable development.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Ireland will participate in economic and monetary union, EMU, from 1 January 1999, when our currency will be the euro. The euro conversion rate of the Irish pound will be consistent with ERM central rates, as announced on 2 May last; the ERM central rate of the Irish pound against the Deutschemark is DM 2.48338.</P>
      <P>It has been noticeable that the countries that will participate in EMU have represented a zone of relative stability in recent weeks.  However, together with my colleagues in other EU member states, I am keeping developments in international financial markets under constant review.</P>

      <P>The basis of the treatment of married persons for tax purposes derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than they would if they were two single people living together.  The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment.  Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax free allowances <Col N="1107" /> and rate bands appropriate to single persons.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I should explain in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple. This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report later this year. My Department is represented on this group and plays an active role in its discussions.</P>

      <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, established as its top priority the reduction in the 9 to 15 per cent of the population, identified as consistently poor in the 1994 Living in Ireland survey, to less than 5 to 10 per cent by the year 2007. Consistent with the strategy, considerable efforts and resources have subsequently been directed towards combating social exclusion and disadvantage under the various commitments agreed in Partnership 2000 and in accordance with the Government's programme.  Furthermore, since the Strategy recognised that the unemployed were the group at the greatest risk of poverty and that the most effective way of reducing poverty was through the creation of jobs, the considerable rise in the numbers at work and the associated large falls in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, recorded in recent years can be taken as representing substantial progress towards meeting the overall target.  The Government is committed to making further advances on the social inclusion front and the forthcoming budget will have regard to this through furthering policies appropriate to the country's economic and social needs.</P>

For example, walk-in-baths, lifting seats and chairs, hoists and lifters and stair lifts designed for people with a disability, as well as iron lungs and kidney machines can qualify for relief.

      <P>The recently-published Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of 1997 shows a figure of £1,329 million in outstanding <Col N="1110" /> taxes and levies.  The figure in the corresponding report last year was £1,690 million.  This represents a substantial reduction of £361 million on last year and continues the trend of recent years which has seen a dramatic reduction in the overall arrears.  The total balance outstanding now represents less than 10 per cent of the annual tax yield, as compared with arrears equivalent to 57 per cent of the current tax yield in 1988.</P>
      <P>The collection of tax is the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Commissioners advise me that this reduction in the overall level of tax debt is the result of a combination of initiatives taken by them.  These include resource-intensive programmes for the collection of debt wherever possible, as well as programmes for discharge or write-off of old uncollectable amounts and, most importantly, vigorous activity to continuously improve compliance in the payment of current taxes.</P>
      <P>As was explained in the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report, the large increase in the amounts of tax written-off &mdash; £281 million in 1997 &mdash; is due to a revision of the Commissioners' write-off policy with a view to deleting from their records the large amounts of debt which are old and regarded as uncollectable and, in the case of estimated assessments from the pre-self assessment era, are likely to overstate actual liabilities. A substantial amount of debt also relates to companies that have ceased trading.  The objective of the programme is that the debt showing on the books will be more realistic and in large measure collectable, and will enable resources to be better targeted and more effectively deployed in collecting arrears.</P>
      <P>The underlying reasons for non-compliance with tax laws are many and varied.  In many cases non-compliance with tax payment obligations arises from serious financial difficulties in the business.  These difficulties vary from temporary cashflow problems to total insolvency.  There are also those who seek to delay making payment or to avoid paying altogether, notwithstanding the significant advances made by Revenue in simplifying procedures in recent years so as to encourage voluntary compliance.  The Revenue Commissioners have now dedicated debt management teams in place in the Collector-General's office, in local inspectors' offices as well as new teams of local collectors.  These teams, aided by the most up-to-date technology and using the relevant statutory powers, apply a case management approach to non-compliance.  The approach is proving particularly successful as is shown by the improvements in return-filing and payment compliance, the reduction in the debt and the healthy Exchequer returns.  These improvements are acknowledged by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his annual report.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989, as amended, are set down in Regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.  Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.  Where the person meets the medical criteria, the local director of community care and medical officer of health issues a primary medical certificate for presentation to the Revenue Commissioners.  Where the issue of a certificate is refused, the person concerned may appeal that decision to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board, whose decision is final.</P>
      <P>The current list of medical criteria was drawn up following a wideranging consultation with all interested parties, including organisations representing the disabled.  The scope of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail in the course of the review, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to many additional categories of disabled people.  I should emphasise that the scheme is targeted at those people who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility.</P>

    <P>It is the nature and the extent of the disability which determines a person's eligibility under the scheme rather than the circumstances which have given rise to that disability.

      <P>In the exemption limits system, the principal distinction made is that on the grounds of age.  The system was originally introduced to assist the elderly, including the widowed elderly.  It was subsequently extended to the generality of the low paid.  The general exemption limits of £4,100 single, £8,200 married rise to £5,000 &mdash; £10,000 for those aged 65 to 74, and to £5,500 &mdash; £11,000 for those aged 75 and over.  In the 1998 budget, I introduced a significant increase in the exemption limits for the elderly and also indicated that it is proposed to eventually achieve a single exemption limit for all those aged 65 and over.  These measures will benefit elderly widowed taxpayers, and in this context it is estimated that almost half of all widowed taxpayers are aged 65 and over.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group on the integration of the tax and welfare systems recommended the gradual abolition of the marginal relief system because of the high marginal tax rates and also the poverty traps associated with it for those returning to work.  This recommendation has been implemented in successive budgets, for the general exemption limits, by increasing personal allowances by more than the exemption limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As pointed out in the question, the main focus of assistance for widowed persons in the income tax code is provided under the personal allowances rather than the exemption limits.  In regard to personal allowances widows are treated more favourably than single persons.  They are entitled to a personal allowance which is £500 greater than the personal allowance granted to single persons. Where a widowed person has a mortage outstanding there is a provision in the income tax code allowing the widowed person to claim allowable interest of up to £3,600.  The comparable figure for a single person is £2,500.  In addition, widowed parents receive the basic single person's personal allowance of £3,150 and a one-parent-family allowance of £3,150.  This means that the widowed parent's basic tax free personal allowances currently stand at £6,300, the equivalent of the basic allowances for a married couple and <Col N="1114" /> double those of a single person without dependent children.  Most widowed parents would also be eligible for the PAYE allowance of £800.</P>
    <P>In addition, the taxation of widows in the year of bereavement is at least as favourable as that of a married couple with the married allowance and double rate bands continuing to apply.  In the year following bereavement, and thereafter, widowed persons are treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than single people.  A widowed parent in the year of bereavement is entitled to a personal allowance of £6,300, widowed allowance of £3,650 plus widowed parent allowance of £2,650, which is the equivalent of the married couples basic allowance.  In addition, in the years following the year of bereavement, a widowed person with dependent children is entitled to a bereavement allowance. In the 1998 budget the period of this allowance was extended from three to five years and the allowance was increased to £5,000 in year one, £4,000 in year two, £3,000 in year three, £2,000 in year four, £1,000 in year five and nil thereafter, with effect from 6 April 1998.</P>

      <P>Each year I receive a large number of proposals and suggestions for special tax allowances and reliefs. I will bear in mind the Deputy's proposal in the context of the preparations for the forthcoming budget.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that tax reliefs, by their very nature, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the current tax system has a number of personal income tax allowances which are related to the care of incapacitated or disabled individuals.  These reliefs include the incapacitated child allowance, the dependent relative allowance, medical expenses relief and convenant relief.</P>

      <P>Where necessary harm reduction and harm minimisation measures are an integral part of drug demand reduction strategies.</P>
      <P>For example, because injecting drug use in Dublin was seen as an extremely high risk behaviour and an important source of transmission of the HIV virus in this country, with almost 50 per cent of cases of HIV being drug-related in 1993, the National AIDS Strategy Committee accepted the need for harm reduction measures, such as methadone maintenance and needle exchange, to ensure that injecting drug users availed of the full range of treatment services and reduced their risk of acquiring HIV.  These programmes have been introduced by the Eastern Health Board and continue to be expanded into areas where the need for such programmes is identified.  Present figures indicate that intravenous drug users account for approximately 43 per cent of the total number of reported cases of HIV.</P>

Research and studies in the area of electromagnetic radiation are carried out by bodies like the World Health Organisation, the International Radiation Protection Association and the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection. I am advised that the general body of scientific evidence to date has not established substantive evidence of any adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields generated by mobile phone masts.</P>
      <P>The Council of Health Ministers is currently preparing a recommendation on the subject of public exposure to electromagnetic fields.  This recommendation, if adopted, will establish a European wide standard which each member state will apply to its own country.

      <P>Temporary bed closures are used to facilitate ward refurbishments and annual leave for staff in the hospital services.  They also take place in the context of effective bed management which forms a normal part of budgetary management strategy and must be set in the context of actual hospital activity for this year.  In the period January to June 1998 total discharges for all hospitals have been almost 4 per cent up on the same period last year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of overnight hospital beds available does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.  For example, trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day case and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point, overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to June 1998 shows an increase of 1.11 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day case activity is 9 per cent.</P>
      <P>The numbers of people on waiting lists at the end of June 1998 and the total number of temporary bed closures to date in 1998 are set out in the following tables.</P>

      <P>There are no plans to establish a tribunal of inquiry along the lines proposed by the Deputy as it is not considered to be an appropriate response to the issue of child abuse.  There would be an intrinsic and probably legally challengeable unfairness in a process which focused on child abuse by clergy of a particular denomination, there is also the consideration that churches are not public bodies.</P>
      <P>I have great sympathy for those who were abused as children and I am personally committed to maintaining progress in the development of our child care system.  The issue of child abuse will be kept under review particularly in assessing any further measures that would be likely to prove useful in ensuring that child abuse does not occur.  In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that the guidelines on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse are currently under review.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline each request for sanction for the appointment of an additional consultant made to date in respect of hospitals within the Southern Health Board area; the nature of each request including the speciality involved; the reason, over the past decade, only nine additional consultants' posts have been sanctioned for appointment to hospitals within the Southern Health Board area resulting in a 5 per cent growth in consultancy cover in that area; and the reason the number of these new posts within the Southern Health Board area falls substantially below the number of appointments sanctioned in respect of every other health board area.</Quest>

      <P>A major review of consultant staffing in the Southern Health Board area was carried out by Comhairle na nOspidéal in 1993.  Overall, the Comhairle report identified a need for significant expansion in consultant manpower for Cork, including joint appointments between Cork University Hospital and the voluntary hospitals in Cork City.  In its report of the review of consultant manpower in the Southern Health Board area, Comhairle identified a lack of consensus between the various institutions in Cork City on the components of a hospital development policy for the city and its environs as a critical factor in the slow progress in creating and filling consultant posts and the disproportionate number of appointments sanctioned for the area, relative to other health boards.  The need to develop consensus on the development of services between the health board and the voluntary hospitals in the Southern Health Board area was a central theme <Col N="1127" /> of the Comhairle report.  A pan-hospital structure, operating under the chairmanship of the Dean of Medicine, UCC was recommended as an appropriate vehicle to facilitate the development of consensus and this has now been established.</P>
      <P>Arising from the deliberations of the pan-hospital arrangements, the management of the Cork hospitals identified specific consultant posts to be filled over the short-term.  The immediate priorities identified were submitted jointly by the SHB and the voluntary hospitals and these are, in order of priority: medical Oncologist-joint appointment &mdash; CUH/Mercy Hospital/South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospital; histopathologist, Mercy Hospital; cardiologist, South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospital/Cork University Hospital, A&amp;E consultant, joint appointment &mdash; CUH/Mercy Hospital/South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospital.</P>
      <P>Funding has been provided by the Department of Health and Children in respect of all these posts.  Approval has also issued to the Mercy Hospital for the filling of a post of consultant paediatrician on a locum basis, pending final agreement on the joint department of paediatrics in the Cork hospitals.</P>
      <P>In addition to the pan-hospital posts, the following formal requests for sanction for additional consultant posts have been received by the Department of Health and Children: histopathologist, CUH; neurosurgeon CUH; plastic surgeon, joint appointment with South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria, anaesthetist, joint appointment CUH/Erinville/St. Finbarr's.</P>
      <P>There have been no requests for additional consultant posts in respect of other acute hospitals in the Southern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>The adminsitration of the registration system for births, deaths and marriages is a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and for local registrars who operate under his direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vital Statistics Regulations, 1954 (S.  I. No. 280 of 1954) provide that particular information in relation to deaths be furnished to the registrar by the person requiring the death to be registered. This information is recorded on a form <Col N="1130" /> supplied by the Central Statistics Office, Form 102, and the particulars include the date and place of death; the name and address of the deceased person; the sex and marital status of the deceased person; the age and occupation of the deceased person.</P>
    <P>In addition, a person registering a death will in most instances produce to the registrar a medical certificate of cause of death signed by a registered medical practitioner stating the cause of death. The registrar is obliged to record the cause of death in the Register of Deaths and will also note the cause of death on the Form 102 before sending the form and the medical certificate of cause of death to the Central Statistics Office.  Where an inquest is held by a coroner in relation to a death and the coroner issues his certificate giving all the details for the registration of the death, the death is registered on foot of that information.  A Form 102 is completed and is sent to the Central Statistics Office together with the coroners certificate.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, HIPE, contains information on all discharges of patients from publicly funded acute hospitals in Ireland.  The system provides detailed data on diagnosis and surgical procedures for each in-patient episode together with an indicator for discharge status which allows hospital deaths to be recorded.</P>
    <P>Data on hospital mortality from HIPE has been used from time to time on a national basis. However, individual hospital morality rates by procedure have not, to date, been used as a performance measure.  There are a number of difficulties concerning the interpretation of mortality data as a true performance indicator.  Issues such as case complexity, age profile and the lack of a single patient identifier all need to be taken into account in any meaningful comparative analysis. It is my view that these data sets should principally be used at health board and hospital level, in consultation with the clinicians involved.</P>
    <P>The health strategy identified the need for a more critical evaluation of the outcome of services through techniques, such as clinical audit. Hospital morality rates are just one of a series of instruments which can be availed of in determining quality outcomes in our hospital services.  The increasing involvement of clinicians in hospital management should also facilitate this process.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the continued development of quality indicators across the health services at regional and national level.  I am also conscious that one of the basic underlying requirements in any measurement of quality will be the need for objective comparisons to be made which demonstrably improve the quality of service for individual patients.</P>

      <P>Arrangements are being made by the Midland Health Board for an educational psychological assessment to be carried out in respect of the child in question.  The results of the educational assessment will be provided to the Department of Education and Science as soon as it becomes available.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine educational psychological assessment for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.  As the psychological services provided by the Department of Education and Science to primary schools are still in the development stage and are at present limited to a small number of schools, health boards currently provide some services for school children on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.  The primary concern, however, of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessment and therapeutic treatment to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and developmental delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently published the report of the planning group on the establishment of a national educational psychological service to provide services for all primary and secondary schools.  Fifteen additional qualified psychologists have been appointed this year.  These psychologists will work in regional teams under the management of the psychological service in the Department of Education and Science.  It will clearly take time for the national educational psychological service to build up an increased level of service provision to children of school going age.  During this interim period, it will be necessary for the developing educational psychological services to work with the health funded services to ensure that the available resources are applied as effectively as possible.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 313, 316, 318, 320 and 321 together.</P>
      <P>Section 9(4) of the Adoption Act, 1991, provides that where an adoption is effected in a place outside the State, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that it was effected in accordance with the law of that place.  Therefore, the Adoption Board is bound to presume when presented with documentary evidence of a particular adoption effected outside the State that it complies with section 1(e) of the Act until the contrary is shown.</P>
      <P>In practice, the board makes its decision on whether or not a particular adoption effected abroad complies with the conditions under 1(a) to 1(e) of the Adoption Act, 1991, by considering the adoption law of the state in which the adoption was effected.  It does this by putting a number of questions regarding the nature and effect of an adoption under that country's law to a practising lawyer in that country.  Based on the lawyer's replies and having regard to the legislation of that country, it makes a decision as to whether or not adoptions effected in that state qualify for entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board does not make an entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions with regard to an application for same by Irish residents where an adoption effected abroad does not meet the conditions I have outlined above and where the applicants were not in possession of a current declaration of suitability and eligibility from the board at the time of the effecting of the adoption.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Board maintains a file in relation to every application for entry in the Register of Foreign Adoptions and a copy of all information submitted by the applicant(s) is retained on the file.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that the board receives this information from the adoptive parents and not from the foreign adoption authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drafting of legislation to enable ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of <Col N="1133" /> Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, 1993, is a priority.  I have had additional staff assigned to my Department during the summer months and a new child care legislation unit has been established in order to commence work on a number of pieces of legislation including the Hague Convention Bill on which preparatory work has commenced.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the abduction or sale of children and to establish a system of co-operation among countries in order to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.  It strives to achieve this objective by dividing responsibilities with regard to the processing of intercountry adoption between sending and receiving states.  It recognises that it is only in this bilateral manner that effective measures to ensure that adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned can be put in place.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the convention will involve major amendment of our foreign adoption laws. The Law Reform Commission recently published a most useful report on the legislative changes necessary to implement the convention.  I intend to build on this report and to take a wideranging approach to the Bill in order to use this legislative opportunity to tackle many of the issues which have arisen in intercountry adoption since the enactment of the Adoption Act, 1991.  Issues such as the practice of persons effecting foreign adoptions by power of attorney and not travelling to the child's country of origin, with the consequence that they do not meet the child prior to the effecting of the adoption, are being considered in this context.  My Department will be consulting with relevant interests before I finalise decisions regarding the approach to be taken in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314, 317 and 324 together.</P>
      <P>The information requested by Deputy Broughan in relation to the number of adopted people and birth parents who are on health board waiting lists for post adoption services will be obtained in due course by the child care legislation unit as part of the research being carried out on the provision of post adoption services and associated issues.  I will make the information available to the Deputy when it has been obtained from the health boards.</P>
      <P>As I have previously explained to the House, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in a case earlier this year which clarified a number of constitutional and legal matters surrounding post-adoption contact.  Specific staff in the newly established child care legislation unit have been assigned to the preparation of legislation in this area.  These staff have been familiarising themselves with the issues involved in this complex area and the Office of the Attorney General has also been consulted in the matter.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to advise Deputy O'Sullivan that the child care legislation unit will be in a position to enter into an extensive consultation process with all interested parties in the coming weeks. The aim of the consultation process is to facilitate an inclusive and well informed approach to the preparation of legislation in this area.  I also intend to hold a one day seminar to give all of those who are involved in the consultation process an opportunity to come together and consider the outcome of the discussions.  I will be listening carefully to all views before finalising my proposals so that this issue can be dealt with in a coherent, integrated and sensitive manner.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Broughan's question on files relating to adoption, the Adoption Board has a file in relation to each application received since its establishment in 1952.  These files are held in a secure place for safe keeping.  I have no plans to instruct the Adoption Board to obtain and store certified copies of files relating to adoption which are currently held by adoption societies. This issue will be examined in due course in the context of the work being undertaken on post adoption services and associated issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 323 together.</P>
      <P>The national intellectual disability database, which was launched last year, includes information on the needs of all persons with a mental handicap including persons with autism although the specific disability is not included.  As part of the implementation of the recommendations of a policy document on Services to Persons with Autism which was published by my Department in 1994, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the needs of persons with autism in their regions and, in particular, on those who require or will require specialist services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to problems with definition, the exact prevalence of autism in Ireland is still open to debate.  Depending on the diagnostic criteria being applied, up to 5 per 10,000 children manifest autism to a marked degree.  The diagnosis of autism is a clinical one, namely, it is based on a variety of observations rather than a defined laboratory investigation.  Hence the concept of an <Col N="1136" />&ldquo;autistic spectrum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability. The officially recognised classification systems are those of DSM IV and ICD 10.</P>
    <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services, including assessment and diagnostic services, day, residential, respite and home support services, which have been substantially enhanced in recent years and which will continue to be developed in the future.  A minority of persons with autism do require specialised facilities.  Additional specific services for persons with autism have been provided in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which now provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall. Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in my Department's policy document on autism is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.  Additional funding amounting to £225,000 in 1994 £300,000 in 1995 and £500,000 in 1997 was made available for the development of services specifically for persons with autism in line with my Department's policy document.</P>
    <P>Assessment, early intervention and other support services, including health related support services provided on an out-reach basis for children of school going age, will continue to be developed and enhanced.  I was pleased to be able to allocate additional funding of £21 million in 1998 for services to persons with a mental handicap and autism.  This includes £10.75 million for the development of new residential, respite and day care places and to meet identified needs in existing services.  Capital funding of £10.25 million is also being provided in 1998, with £5.25 million of this funding being the first instalment of the £30 million national capital programme which I have put in place to run over four years in tandem with the service developments identified in An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001.  The assessment provides a comprehensive picture of the requirements for additional residential and day services for persons with a mental handicap, including those with autism, over the period concerned. The Government is committed to the ongoing development of the autism services as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>Behaviour management programmes are an integral part of all pre-school programmes whether for normal or developmentally delayed children including children with autism.  Behaviour analysis is a requirement before behaviour management is instituted.  The extent and depth of such analysis varies from programme to programme. There is no universally accepted programme based on one single theory.  Consequently practice differs from one centre to another with many different programmes used in the care and development of services for children <Col N="1137" /> and adults with autism.  Service providers in Ireland are well aware of these programmes and incorporate elements of some of these approaches in the programmes which they provide and which are designed to meet the needs of individual children and adults.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the presence in water supplies, particularly near the outfall of sewage treatment plants, of such recognised endocrine disrupters as alkylphenols, which are capable of mimicking the oestrogen hormone; if his attention has been further drawn to the public health implications arising from the presence of these substances in the public water supply; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been concern for a number of years that that certain man-made and naturally occurring substances which are commonly released into the environment can have endocrine disrupting potential.  Attention to date has generally focused on chemicals which can mimic natural or synthetic oestrogens and which can be described as having a feminising or oestrogenic effect.  The relative importance of the many groups of chemicals which show oestrogenic effects has yet to be established.  Some recent research suggests that the concern with oestrogen-mimicking chemicals is significantly less than was previously suspected.</P>
      <P>One of the principal suspected endocrine disrupters is the group of chemicals known as alkylphenols or alkyphenol-ethoxylates, such as nonylphenol or nonylphenol-ethoxylates.  These substances are used, for example, in the metalfinishing industry and as industrial, but not domestic, detergents.  Parcom Recommendation 92/8 on nonylphenol-ethoxylates indicates that, while no environmentally negative effects have been observed, the contracting parties, including Ireland, agreed to study all uses of such substances and to phase out their use as cleaning agents by 2000.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence of the presence in water supplies in Ireland of alkylphenols or alkylphenol-ethoxylates and these substances are not the subject of systematic monitoring.  The Environmental Protection Agency commissioned a number of research projects on dangerous substances, including oestrogen-mimicking chemicals such as alkylphenols.  The reports from these projects will provide a basis for consideration of what further action may be appropriate including the identification of additional priority substances for monitoring purposes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 340 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals in the recent UK White Paper on the future of transport are of interest in the ongoing development of transport policies.  Policy responses to growth in transport demand must be based on an integrated approach to transport requirements, including increased investment in road infrastructure but also improvements in public transport, management of road transport demand, promotion of alternative transport modes, better co-ordination of transport and land use planning, and improved traffic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters are being addressed, <i>inter alia</i>, in urban transport initiatives such as the DTI.  The <Col N="1139" /> recently published DTO Short Term Action Plan focuses on a range of measures, including public transport enhancement, traffic management, the provision of cycling facilities, the implementation of safe routes to school and the development of sustainable commuter plans.  There is no proposal for an initiative aimed at prohibiting car access to cities on a particular day.</P>

      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002, indicates that, in common with a majority of EU member states, it is not proposed at this stage to regulate in Ireland for a specific prohibition on the use of mobile phones by drivers.  The safe use of mobile phones by drivers will be however promoted through information campaigns and sponsorship will be sought from the mobile phone industry for this purpose. Work towards developing a penalty points system is proceeding in accordance with the commitment in the Government strategy.  This system, when finalised and incorporated in legislation, will be open to modification and adaptation in light of subsequent circumstances.</P>

      <P>: The Government's commitment to the ideal of home ownership is affirmed in An Action Programme for the Millennium and is strongly reflected in the Government's Action on House Prices, which was published in prompt response to the Bacon report.  Measures to improve the position of lower income house buyers form a major element of the package, including improvements in the local auhority shared ownership scheme, removal of fiscal incentives to investors who were pricing first time buyers out of the market, significant reductions in stamp duty rates particularly at the lower house price levels, and initiatives to boost housing supply, such as the provision of special Exchequer funding for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure to open up additional land for housing.</P>
      <P>The full effect of many of these measures, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, will only be seen in the medium term. However, positive effects of the Government's Action on House Prices have already been reported by market sources, including signs of some easing of the house prices situation, first time buyers reclaiming the starter home market and an increase in the number of second hand houses coming on the market as a result of stamp duty reductions.  Housing output in 1998 is set to exceed last year's record level.  However, I will be keeping developments in the housing market under review to ensure that we continue to make progress in meeting the Government's housing objectives as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium and that home ownership remains an option for those who reasonably aspire to it.</P>

      <P>A reasoned opinion was served by the European Commission on Ireland on 8 April 1998 in relation to overgrazing.  The reasoned opinion related to the effect of overgrazing on the conservation of wild birds, in respect of the red grouse, and the conservation of natural habitats and or flora and fauna, in respect of the Owen-duff-Nephin Beg Complex special protection area.  Responsiblity at ministerial level for these matters lies with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  A comprehensive reply to the reasoned opinion was sent to the Commission on 1 September 1998.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 115 on 6 May 1998 which outlined the measures being taken by the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to address the question of overgrazing.</P>
      <P>Overgrazing can be a significant factor in the deterioration of water quality; where soil cover is eroded, high rainfall may wash fine silt and other suspended matter into water.  Sheep faeces are also a factor in bacteriological contamination of raw water.  I also refer the Deputy to the reply to Question No. 225 of 6 May 1998 in relation to the measures being taken by my Department and others to address problems of contamination in water supplies.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to certain EU member states which favour the use of landfill as a disposal option for inert wastes only. These member states have a well developed waste management infrastructure, incorporating significant incineration and biological treatment capacity.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government very recently published a policy statement on waste management, with the aim of providing a national framework within which more sustainable waste management practices, <Col N="1145" /> reflecting the requirements of the waste hierarchy, will be applied.</P>
      <P>This policy framework supports a dramatic reduction in reliance on landfill, in favour of an integrated waste management approach which utilises a range of waste treatment options to deliver ambitious national waste recovery targets within a 15 year timescale.  It anticipates: a diversion of 50 per cent of household waste away from landfill; a minimum 65 per cent reduction in biodegradable wastes consigned to landfill; the development of waste recovery facilities employing environmentally beneficial technologies, including the development of biological treatment facilities with a capacity of up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum; the recycling of 35 per cent of municipal waste; the recovery of at least 50 per cent of C&amp;D waste within a five year period, with a progressive increase to at least 85 per cent over 15 years; a rationalisation of municipal waste landfills, leading to an integrated network of perhaps 20 state-of-the-art facilities incorporating energy recovery and high standards of environmental protection; and an 80 per cent reduction in methane emissions from landfill of waste.</P>

      <P>Current road traffic regulations require the fitting of seat belts in all forward facing front seats in all minibuses, including those used as school buses, which have a design gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3500 kg and are first registered on or after 1 January 1992, from 1 October 1999.  Under EU Directive 96/36/EC, member states will be allowed to require that all seating positions in new passenger vehicles with seating for more than eight persons excluding the driver, are fitted with seat belts: vehicles designed to accommodate standing passengers are excluded. The adoption of this requirement would <i>inter alia</i> involve the phasing out of the present 3:2 rule which applies to school buses.  As indicated in the Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002, I intend, in consultation with the Minister for Education and Science, to bring forward proposals for enhancing school bus safety; these will be the subject of a public consultation process before finalising action.</P>

For existing provisional licence holders, an oral test of the rules of the road will be conducted, as at present, as part of the driving test.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 and 360 together.</P>
      <P>The 1996 assessment of housing needs disclosed that the number of households assessed as in need of local authority housing at 29 March 1996 was 27,427.  Details of the assessment, including a breakdown of housing needs for each local authority, are given in my Department's housing statistics bulletin for 1996 which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  The next assessment of housing need will be carried out by local authorities in March 1999.  Guidelines in relation to the carrying out of the assessment will issue shortly to local authorities.</P>
      <P>I expect that about 3,500 houses will be completed or purchased by local authorities in 1998. These, together with output from the complementary social housing measures and vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock, will enable some 10,000 households to be catered for in 1998.  Having regard to increasing needs, I will be seeking additional resources for social housing in the 1999 Estimates.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, and also to certain people with disabilities under that age who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel, primarily at off-peak periods, to <Col N="1152" /> eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  At the end of last June, free travel passes had been issued in respect of over 505,000 people at an estimated cost of £33 million.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a free travel pass an applicant aged under 66 years must be in receipt of one of the following qualifying payments: invalidity pension; blind person's pension; disability allowance; carer's allowance; unemployability supplement or workmen's compensation supplement with disablement pension, for at least 12 months; or a social security invalidity/incapacity pension/ benefit, or an equivalent payment, for at least 12 months from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement.  People, including public servants, suffering from ill-health who do not fulfil the necessary PRSI conditions will not qualify for invalidity pension.  However, disability allowance is available to those, including public servants, who are medically suitable, aged between 16 and 66 years and satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>The cost of extending the free travel scheme to public servants who retire on grounds of ill health cannot be estimated, as statistics are not available. However, any extension to the free travel scheme would involve additional expenditure that could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will provide a solution to the self-employed pensioners question of less than ten years contribution; if consideration will be given in the 1998 budget to allow pro rata pensions for those with over five years contributions; and his views on whether a start needs to be made in the budget in view of the fact that these people had their contributions taken from them over the years and were unable to invest these contributions in an alternative pension scheme.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  Any self employed person who has contributed and does not qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory pension receives a refund of the pension element &mdash; 53 per cent &mdash; of his or her PRSI contributions with interest, which is a fair arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A non-contributory pension is, of course, available to former self employed people, who have insufficient contributions, in the same way as it is available to every other citizen, resident in the State, subject to a means test.  As I have stated on a number of occasions, I will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible.  I am fully conversant with the issue in question and would like to reassure the Deputy, and this House, that the matter is receiving my detailed attention. However, I must stress that the cost of paying an old age contributory pension to this group of people would be significant and any proposal in this regard would have to be assessed against <Col N="1154" /> other competing demands in the social welfare area.</P>

Following a recent review of his entitlement his means were re-assessed at £32 per week derived from his benefit from his partner's earnings with effect from 27 May 1998 and a deciding officer made a decision to that effect.</P>
      <P>An appeal was received in the independent social welfare appeals office from the person concerned against this decision on 21 July 1998 and in accordance with the statutory requirements a submission was requested from the deciding officer on the grounds of appeal advanced.

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established by this Department in 1996 to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community. Under the scheme, grants are made available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, which have undertaken to identify the older people in the community in need of the scheme's services.  Under the scheme grants are available for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems.  Funding is not available for conventional burglar alarms under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Older people, aged 65 or over, who live alone or in households made up exclusively of older and-or other dependent vulnerable people and who are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves, can benefit from the scheme.  However, as the Deputy is aware, the <Col N="1155" /> primary objective of this scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people by the provision of funding specifically for security equipment and in this regard funding towards the cost of installing a telephone is not covered under the scheme.  However, I am anxious to ensure that the scheme remains focused and provides assistance in the most appropriate way.  In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. As the final report of the consultants will not be available until later this year it would not be appropriate to consider making changes to the scheme at this point.</P>

      <P>Whale and dolphin species are protected wild animals under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and also receive protection under the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937.  Any person seeking to import cetaceans into Ireland would have to comply with the provisions within Countil Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 &mdash; on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein &mdash; for the movement of cetaceans between countries &mdash; which is strictly limited. Such a person would also be required to comply with the licensing requirements for the importation of such species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 (Control of Importation of Wild Animals and Wild Birds), Regulations, 1989.  Within these statutory parameters, any application for the importation of a cetacean, or the keeping of a cetacean in captivity, would fall to be considered on its merits in consultation with other relevant Government Departments in relation to such matters as the control of infectious diseases.  I would find it difficult to envisage such applications being granted except in very exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>The International Whaling Commission is the international forum for the control and regulation of whaling and is representative of all shades of international opinion on this subject.  Ireland as a member of this commission has played a particularly important role in the IWC in seeking consensus among all member countries on proposals put forward for discussion by Ireland at the IWC meeting in Monaco in October 1997.  These proposals were put forward in the context of a situation whereby the number of whales taken has increased from 383 whales in 1992 to 1,043 whales in 1997 and the figure is expected to increase again this year.  The proposals seek to address this deteriorating situation by ensuring less whales are killed and that any whaling that does take place is closely regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish proposals were also discussed at the annual meeting of the IWC in Oman in May of this year.  The general view of all countries participating was that the process of dialogue and discussion initiated by the Irish compromise proposals was worth pursuing and all countries would participate in the process of discussion if required.  In particular, there was strong support for the proposals from the middle ground countries as a basis for the resolution of the ongoing conflict within the IWC in relation to commercial whaling.  These countries, including Ireland, consider that compromise formed the best basis for ensuring the continuation of a strong and effect IWC which is crucial to enable threats to the whale species from environmental change and <Col N="1158" /> exploitation to be adequately addressed now and in the future.  Ireland, through the IWC, will continue to facilitate and seek agreement on any proposals which will reduce the number of whales killed and to ensure that any whaling which does take place will be strictly regulated.</P>

      <P>I have no function in relation to the making of by-laws for taxi stands.  These by-laws are drafted by the Garda Commissioner following consultation with the local authority concerned and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  The approval of the Attorney General is also required.  Following this approval the by-laws are signed by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  In accordance with these procedures, the Garda Commissioner forwarded the draft by-laws, referred to by the Deputy, to the Department of the Environment and Local Government in November, 1997 for their observations, prior to sub-mitting them to the Attorney General for his approval.  I understand that the Department of the Environment and Local Government suggested a number of amendments, and that the chief superintendent at Waterford is amending the schedule of appointed stands in consultation with Waterford Corporation.  I wish to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to have the process completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the report published recently by JUSTICE, the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, which deals with the growing use of devices and software packages capable of intercepting personal communications via e-mail, Internet and so on and suggests that the availability of this technology poses a significant threat to individual privacy; if this technology is available to the Garda Síochána and the security forces here; if so, the circumstances in which it is permitted to be deployed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy is referring which deals with the subject of &ldquo;Covert policing and human rights <Col N="1161" /> standards&rdquo; in the UK.  The rapid recent growth in the use of media such as e-mail, Internet etc.  for personal and other forms of cummunications does of course carry with it inherent threats to the privacy of individual users.  Due to the very nature of such media, these problems are common to all jurisdictions.  There have been a number of statutory and non-statutory developments in this area in this State.</P>
      <P>The Data Protection Act, 1988, requires data controllers to take &ldquo;appropriate security measures&rdquo; to prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of data.  Under the Act, the Commissioner is empowered and indeed obliged to, investigate any complaints lodged in respect of an alleged breach of privacy.  I understand also that the Commissiner is currently examining a set of draft guidelines for Internet users and service providers prepared by the Council of Europe, with a view to their possible adoption and implementation in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The working group on illegal and harmful use of the Internet which published its first report in July this year acknowledged, <i>inter alia,</i> the threat posed to personal privacy by the Internet and ponted towards the Data Protection Act and the general principles enshrined in data protection as the best means of regulating &mdash; including the safeguarding of personal privacy &mdash; what is an extremely complex area.  Also, in June 1988, the Law Reform Commission published a report entitled: &ldquo;Privacy: Surveillance and Interception of Communications&rdquo;.  This report contains a series of recommendations, some of which are concerned with the imposition of civil liability for privacy-invasive surveillance and harassment where others are concerned with the creation of new criminal offences and with regulatory provisions. The recommendations made in the report cover a range of very complex issues and will require detailed study within my Department.</P>
      <P>Finally, it is not the practice, for good reason, to provide details in relation to specific security matters, but the Deputy will be aware that the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunication Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993 regulates the exercise by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of his power to authorise the interception of postal packets and telecommunications messages.  Ministerial warrants under the provisions of the 1993 Act are issued in very exceptional circumstances in the public interest when this is necessary for security purposes, or for the prevention and detection of serious crime, and then only for the securing of information which can be obtained in no other way.  The operation of the Act is kept under review by the President of the High Court who is the designated judge under section 8 of the Act.</P>

      <P>The distinction which is made in relation to cases heard in the Special Criminal Court is between scheduled offences and non-scheduled offences.  Scheduled offences for the purpose of Part V of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 are included in Statutory Instruments Numbers 142 of 1972 and 282 of 1972 and in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998.  Statistics are not maintained in such a manner as to provide an answer to the Deputy's Question or indeed to provide the number of scheduled and non-scheduled offences tried by the Special Criminal Court and it would involve the application of an inordinate amount of scarce staffing resources to provide this information.</P>
      <P>In the case of the legal year 1 August 1997 to 31 July 1998, namely the last legal year, five cases were tried in the Special Criminal Court in which non scheduled offences were alleged.  The number of persons involved was ten.  The non scheduled offences tried there covered false imprisonment, possession of drugs, drug offences and robbery.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that I am fully committed to the development of community sanctions and measures as alternatives to custody in cases where the court decides that a sentence of imprisonment is not appropriate. There are a number of alternatives to custody already in place.  On average, on a daily basis, there are approximately 4,400 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the probation and welfare service.</P>
      <P>One alternative to custody is community service. In 1997, over 1,100 offenders were required to perform community service by the courts.  The Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, has been in operation since 5 December, 1984.  It provides criminal courts with this additional sanction which they may apply in appropriate cases, namely, where a person is convicted of an offence for which the court considers that the appropriate penalty would be a custodial sentence &mdash; excluding offences where the penalty is fixed by law, such as murder.  A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision.  This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision.  Participants on supervision orders from the courts may be referred to this scheme in place of a substantial custodial sentence &mdash; two years or more.</P>
      <P>It is my Department's policy to develop probation as a viable alternative to imprisonment and towards this end funding is provided to over 40 hostels, day-centres and workshops in various parts of the country.  These projects are operated by a number of voluntary, community and business groups in association with the probation and welfare service and are working to intervene with young people at risk of offending and to reduce re-offending among those who already are involved with criminal behaviour and on supervision to the service.  The financial assistance available to these bodies in 1997 was £4.2 million. The 1998 budget allocation is £5.06 million &mdash; for current plus capital costs.  I wish to inform the Deputy that in relation to prisons that the current prison building programme, new prisons and major refurbishments of existing prisons, will provide the most appropriate modern facilities for prisons and staff.</P>

    <P>New arrangements for processing claims to refugee status were introduced in December last <Col N="1165" /> following extensive consultation with the UNHCR.

      <P>Section 22 (5) of the Refugee Act, 1996, provides that a transfer under the terms of the Dublin Convention shall not take <Col N="1166" /> place unless the receiving country has agreed to accept responsibility for the examination of the application in question.  It is important to note that the Convention's starting point is that it guarantees the member states' commitment to honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention which specifically provides that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>

The establishment of responsibility for examining applications for asylum implicitly pre-supposes that member states have mutual confidence in each other as one member state consents to an application for asylum lodged with it being processed by another member state in accordance with the latter's national legislation.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Convention which came into operation on 1 September, 1997 provides a basis for determining the state responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the member states of the European Communities.  An underlying philosophy of the Dublin Convention is a basic confidence on the part of the member states in each other's procedures in relation to asylum law.  The Convention's starting point is that it guarantees the member states' commitment to honour their obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees which specifically provides that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  This prohibition on refoulement is given effect in section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to set up a central register of reported missing persons in co-operation with the Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and other relevant Departments in order to pro-actively gauge the true numbers of disappeared persons in view of the fact that a constituent of Deputy G. Mitchell was missing for approximately two years, did not collect his social welfare payments or pay his local authority rent for the entire period and was subsequently found to have been dead at home all of this time; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, I have taken a particular interest in relation to the issue of missing persons, and I am concerned to ensure that the Garda Síochána have effective arrangements in place to trace those who are reported missing.  The individual to whom the Deputy referred in his question was undoubtedly vulnerable but as the Deputy has not supplied any details I cannot comment further.  As the House will be aware I have no responsibility in relation to monitoring those in receipt of social welfare payments, local authority housing or other social services, but I have asked my officials to discuss with their opposite numbers in the other Departments, whether the type of reporting arrangements advocated by the Deputy would be likely to be of benefit in the case of missing persons.</P>
      <P>The question of taking any additional operational measures to investigate cases of persons who go missing in suspicious circumstances is kept under constant review by the Garda Commissioner. Currently, the Garda Missing Persons Bureau is responsible for the tracing of all persons reported missing, and as part of this function, liaises with the families concerned.  The Garda Síochána make every effort to locate all persons reported as missing, where the disappearance is classified as an &ldquo;acceptable missing person&rdquo;. This classification covers persons who are under 18 years, the elderly, physically or mentally handicapped persons, or whose disappearance occurred in circumstances which give rise to fears for their physical or moral safety.  It has to be borne in mind that some adults may decide, in effect, to go &ldquo;missing&rdquo;.  While this undoubtedly gives rise to great concern on the part of their families and friends, it is a personal choice for the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Garda Commissioner's recent decision to appoint an assistance commissioner with overall responsibility to review a specific number of cases and related matters.  I am sure <Col N="1168" /> the Deputy appreciates the complexities involved in investigating missing persons cases.  While overall statistics are no consolation to those involved, or their families, I think its worth noting that by international standards the Irish situation compares favourably.  In 1997, the last year for which figures are available, 1,877 &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; missing persons were reported to the gardaí.  Of these, six remained missing at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I am aware there are difficulties for people with disabilities at Cork District Court in accessing certain parts of the building as outlined in the question.</P>
      <P>The areas which are not accessible to people with disabilities amount to less than 15 per cent of the total area of the courthouse.  I understand that some of the District Court offices are located at ground floor level, including the cash office and the family law office and arrangements are in place so that people with disabilities can transact all their business in the ground floor offices.  I also understand that a room is made available to any legal practitioner with disabilities who cannot gain access to the legal practitioners' room.</P>
      <P>However, as I am concerned to ensure that people with disabilities should have access throughout the building, I can inform the Deputy that a review of the accommodation needs at Cork District Court is currently under way including the access difficulties outlined in the question.</P>

      <P>I recently met the St. Monica's Drugs Intervention Team, who briefed me on proposals which they had submitted under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, to build a premises in Edenmore from which to run their drug prevention, recovery and intervention programme.</P>
      <P>Decisions on the allocation of the £20 million funding under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund which is being targeted at Drugs Task Force areas, will be made on foot of proposals received from development groups which have been established in those areas to prepare integrated plans on the basis of operational guidelines agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.</P>
      <P>Under these guidelines, the development groups were required, as part of the development process, to identify gaps in services and facilities for young people at risk in the area, engage in as wide a consultation process as possible with local groups and statutory agencies and submit their plan to the local drug task force for their views, before forwarding the final plan to an assessment committee, chaired by my Department.  The assessment committee will evaluate the plans and make recommendations to the Cabinet committee regarding the allocation of funding to implement the plans in due course.</P>
      <P>The assessment committee can, of course, only consider those proposals which have been included in the integrated plan prepared at local level.  I understand the development group in Dublin North East did not include the proposal from St. Monica's Drug Intervention Team in its plan, which was submitted to the assessment committee on 30 September last.</P>
      <P>However, on foot of a recommendation in the action plan of the North East Drugs Task Force, the Government has already allocated £151,000 to St. Monica's Community Council &mdash; of which the St. Monica's Drug Intervention Team is an affiliate &mdash; to allow it to develop a full range of treatment services &mdash; including family support, education and prevention programmes, drug misuser support programmes and co-ordination &mdash; in conjunction with drug services being developed by the Eastern Health Board in the Edenmore Health Centre.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 405, 406 and 468 together.</P>
      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.  In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support where necessary of remedial or resource teachers. Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in special schools, including schools dedicated to children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional-behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, a number of special classes catering specifically for children with autism, have been established in both primary schools and special schools.  To date a total of 14 such classes have been set up in primary schools and seven classes in special schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each class, which caters for a maximum of six children, receives the support of a class teacher, a child care assistant and special capitation funding. <Col N="1175" /> In addition, an outreach support service is provided by the relevant health authority.</P>
    <P>The establishment of additional classes in a number of locations, including those mentioned by the Deputy, is currently under active consideration in my Department.</P>
    <P>Support services are provided on the basis of an assessed level of need.  My Department does not have precise data on the overall extent of the condition in the school going population. However, research data from the Eastern Health Board found a prevalence rate of five per 10,000 persons in the age range 0-25 who met diagnostic criteria for autism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge and place great value on all aspects of the work carried out by youth organisations within communities.  Given their role in the development and social education of young people, youth organisations have a potential to play a significant role in addressing the broad range of challenges that confront young people including those highlighted by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>My Department directly supports the work of these organisations through the provision of grant aid.  In 1998, the overall level of resources made available for the provision of youth work services is £13,567,000 representing an increase of 1.7 per cent over the provision in 1997.  Due to the high level of ongoing commitments, it has not been possible to increase the level of grant aid made available to individual organisations and initiatives. However, additional funding is being sought for this year and in the event of such funding becoming available, the level of support made available to youth organisations will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £13.567 million provided by my Department in 1998 for youth services, significant funding is being provided under the Government's programme for young people at risk.  The centrepiece of the programme is a young people's facilities and services fund of £30 million to be provided over three years to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas.  This new fund is in addition to the £10 million provided to implement the plans of the local drug task forces.</P>

      <Quest>if he has received a submission dated 17 September 1998 from the board of management of St. Matthew's national school, Cranfield Place, Irishtown, Dublin 4, in relation to the provision of a caretaker and clerical assistance, funding and capitation grant payments and the supply of qualified substitutes to cover for approved absences; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that I have recently received a submission as set out by the Deputy from the board of management of Saint Matthew's National School, Cranfield Place, Irishtown, Dublin 4.  The submission is being considered by officials within my Department and a response to the points raised in the submission will be communicated to the board shortly.  I would add that I am fully aware of the ongoing demands for increased resources for primary schools in general.  In this regard the Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that the 1998 Estimates provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education over the 1997 budget allocation.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to continuing to effect sigificant <Col N="1177" /> improvements in the level of funding at primary level, and that this commitment will be further reflected in the 1999 Estimates.</P>
    <P>Concerning the matter of teacher supply, on my appointment as Minister, I immediately recognised the need to increase the supply of trained teachers.  Accordingly, last autumn, I increased the intake into graduate courses by 200.</P>
    <P>I continued this process in the current year by increasing the intake to the colleges of education to over 1,000 places.  I intend to continue with this process for the next number of years.</P>
    <P>I also introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost the supply of trained teachers, including the recognition of fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification. Additionally, I have agreed that B.Ed. graduates from St. Mary's College in Belfast will be recognised as fully qualified teachers provided that they have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification.</P>
    <P>Discussions have also commenced with the University of Limerick with a view to providing a one year course for primary degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who either have Irish as a final subject in their degree or have honours in Irish at Leaving Certificate level or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>I recently announced that, from 1 September 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level Leaving Certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Education Awards, will, from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes provided that they attained a grade C or higher in higher level Irish in the Leaving Certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to closely monitor the issue of teacher supply.</P>

      <P>I have recently received the report of a working group which I set up last autumn to examine the potential problems caused by the weight of heavy schoolbags.  The group's report outlines a number of recommendations which have implications, not only for my Department, but also for schools, parents and publishers.  One of the main recommendations relates to the need to heighten the awareness of the potential health hazards posed by excessively heavy schoolbags.</P>
      <P>In this regard my Department is in the process of initiating an awareness raising campaign by arranging for the dissemination of the report, with an accompanying circular, to all primary and post-primary schools.  Furthermore, information leaflets and posters will be distributed to all schools highlighting the potential problems and outlining a range of local measures that can be adopted in order to alleviate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the report has only recently been made available to me, but I can confirm that all aspects of the report will be <Col N="1179" /> considered within my Department and appropriate action taken, where necessary.</P>

      <P>Special arrangements are made for candidates who would have a difficulty in communicating what they know to an examiner because of a physical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or of a specific learning difficulty e.g. dyslexia.

      <P>I propose to take Qustions Nos. 421 and 422 together.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of ongoing concerns among school authorities generally on the level of funding allocated to primary schools, my attention has not specifically been drawn to any difficulties relating to the school referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> The Government is committed to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources, as set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium.  This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, where I provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress provided for the introduction of a phased scheme of additional capitation grants with a view to expanding the provision of caretaking and clerical services to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more.</P>
    <P>The priority has been to extend the scheme in the first instance to schools which have no caretaking or clerical provision.  In this regard the scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment figure, to the current figure of 195 pupils.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the school referred to by the Deputy does not qualify for an additional capitation grant for either clerical or caretaking services at this stage as its enrolment of 122 pupils is well below the qualifying threshold.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to further improvements in this programme until such time as all national schools of 100 pupils or over will ultimately be grant assisted towards the cost of clerical and caretaking services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 423 and 432 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources.  I can assure the Deputies that, in the context of the 1999 Estimates, I am currently examining a range of options, including the question of increasing the <Col N="1185" /> level of capitation rates, with a view to identifying appropriate ways to fulfil this commitment.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment in this regard was clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, which provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education.  In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant represented an important step forward in the process of improving funding of the primary sector.  It is important to note, however, that the difference in grant level between primary and post-primary levels reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools.  In addition, the second level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of expenditures.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.  While I am fully aware of the views of the education partners on this issue, there can be no question of a multi-annual agreement with the INTO, management bodies and parents.  Any increases in the capitation grant at primary level are a matter for agreement between my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and myself.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools.  School authorities are required to supplement the capitation grant with a local contribution, which traditionally amounted to 25 per cent of the State grant.  Since 1995 the local contribution has been frozen at £10 per pupil in the case of mainstream schools, and at £9.50 per pupil in the case of schools designated as disadvantaged. In effect, therefore, the required local contribution has already fallen well below the traditional 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the State is obliged under the Constitution to provide for free primary education and to ensure that such education is available to children.  This is achieved through the partnership between the State and local community which is expressed in the State grant combined with the local contribution.</P>
      <P>At the moment officials in my Department are examining all the issues involved.  When that review has been completed I will be in a position to decide on any further phasing out of the local contribution requirement.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 425, 426, 427, 428 and 429 together.</P>
      <P>On my appointment as Minister, I immediately recognised the need to increase the supply of trained teachers.  Accordingly, last autumn, I increased the intake into graduate courses by 200.</P>
      <P>I have continued this process in the current year by increasing the intake to the colleges of education to over 1,000 places.  I intend to continue with this process for the next number of years.</P>
      <P>I also introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost the supply of trained teachers including the recognition of fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification. Additionally, I have agreed that B.Ed. graduates from St. Mary's College in Belfast will be recognised as fully qualified teachers provided that they have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification.</P>
      <P>Discussions have also commenced with the University of Limerick with a view to providing a one year course for primary degree holders who hold the higher diploma in education and who either have Irish as a final subject in their degree or have honours in Irish at leaving certificate level or its equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> I recently announced that from 1 September 1998 all primary degree holders who also hold the higher diploma in education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years' duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, will, from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>

      <P>The capacity of individual special schools to provide escort and seat belts on special transport services is largely dependent on resource allocations from my Department.  The school in question is not currently included in the pilot scheme of escorts funded by my Department. The present pilot phase of the escort scheme is focused on: facilitating the appointment of escorts on services to special schools for children with physical disabilities, and providing assistance towards the cost of escorts for pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus or train at weekends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department allocates funding to special schools, subject to resource availability, to facilitate the purchase of safety harnesses for special needs pupils on certain transport services.  A grant of £2,750 was allocated to the school in question in 1996.  I can assure the Deputy that I am very much aware of the need to extend the existing escort scheme on special school transport <Col N="1188" /> services and to provide additional funding for the purchase of safety harnesses.  I am currently giving active consideration to possible measures in this regard.</P>

    <P>Leonardo da Vinci is the European Union programme for the implementation of a European Community vocational training policy.  One of the aims of this programme is to develop language and other skills relevant for a mobile workforce. Under this programme, a number of post-leaving certificate students as well as those undergoing initial vocational education and training may avail of up to 12 weeks' study in another member state in order to support the development of language <Col N="1191" /> skills.  In Ireland this programme is administered by Léargas.</P>
    <P>In addition, the post-leaving certificate courses in international teleservices include a mandatory work placement abroad of at least 17 weeks so that students can achieve the required level of immersion in their chosen continental language and culture.  A grant scheme of up to £2,000 per student has been introduced towards the cost of this, for all participants in the programme, in the selected centres.</P>

      <P>Clause 7 (6) of the higher education grants scheme states, <i>inter alia,</i> that grants shall not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification.  Therefore a person, who holds a masters degree and is studying for a PhD degree, is ineligible to receive funding in respect of the second postgraduate qualification.</P>
      <P>Due to the considerable cost involved, and the many competing demands, I have no plans to amend this provision of the higher education grants scheme at this time.  However, I would point out to the Deputy that I have significantly increased the funding available for post-graduate research scholarships.</P>

      <P>I recently received representations from the schools referred to by the Deputy, regarding their unsuccessful application for inclusion, as part of the Clondalkin consortium, in the 8-15 Early School Leavers Initiative.  The representations also referred to the schools' desire to seek inclusion in the Breaking the Cycle scheme; the Teacher Counsellor scheme; and their request for extra remedial teacher posts.</P>
      <P>The application from the group in question for inclusion in the Early School Leavers Initiative was one of a large number of applications received by my Department.  All applications were examined by a special selection committee comprised of representatives of my Department and outside agencies involved in this area.  A total of 14 project areas were selected for inclusion in the present phase of the initiative.  The scope of this new initiative is limited in terms of the number of projects which can be refunded, and the key objective was to select strategic pilot projects in urban and rural areas of disadvantage which will develop models of good practice with a view to their integration, after structured evaluation, into mainstream policy and practice.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Breaking the Cycle scheme, the Teacher Counsellor scheme and the question of extra remedial teacher posts, my capacity to extend these services to additional schools in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.</P>
      <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken to address the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I am aware that this school serves a disadvantaged area, but I should point out that, in addition to the mainstream staff, the school also has the services of two concessionary teachers because of its disadvantaged status, two remedial teachers, two resource teachers for travellers, one teacher counsellor, one home-school liaison teacher, two Early Start teachers and six teachers under the Breaking the Cycle Initiative.  In the circumstances, I regret that there is no basis for the allocation of any additional staff to this school.</P>

    <P>It is estimated that there are approximately 8,000 pupils with special needs fully integrated at primary level.  There are no figures available for children with special needs at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the number of children attending specialist remedial, resource or visiting teachers varies from teacher to teacher depending on the degree of learning difficulty, the specific disability of the pupils concerned and also on the number of schools, and distance between each school, in each caseload. Therefore, the following table indicates an approximate estimate of the number of pupils concerned. <Col N="1198" /></P>

    <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of the visiting teacher service is not readily available.</P>
    <P>My Department responds to requests for additional assistance in respect of children with special educational needs from the schools concerned. These requests specify the specific needs of the particular pupils and identify the specialist support requirements.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education and Science I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide spectrum of needs.  I have to determine priorities and allocate resources to best effect.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of each school seeking additional specialist support is considered when decisions relating to the allocation of additional support teachers are being made.</P>
    <P>In late 1996, my Department commissioned the Education Research Centre, Drumcondra to undertake a study in regard to the provision of remedial teaching services in schools.</P>
    <P>This survey focused, among other matters, on the number of pupils receiving remedial instruction; how pupils were selected for remedial teaching; the relevance of programmes being followed; and the progress being made by pupils.</P>
    <P>The survey was conducted in a number of schools that were selected at random during 1997. The report of the survey has recently beeen received in my Department and my officials are studying its contents at present.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the summary report of this remedial study will be released for publication shortly.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concern of students regarding the inadequacy of the third level maintenance grant and the capitation charge which has not been capped; the proposals, if any, he has to resolve these issues; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Higher Education Grants scheme and the ESF-Aided Maintenance Grant scheme comprise the third level maintenance grants schemes.  In the 1996-7 academic year, almost 48,000 students received grants under these schemes.  The 1996 cost of the schemes was £91 million.</P>
      <P>The value of the maintenance grant under the student support schemes was increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-9 academic year.  This increase is in line with the practice in recent years to increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index for the period mid February to mid-February each year.  The full maintenance grant for the current academic year has been increased to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £600 at the adjacent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were increased by 3.2 per cent based on the increase in the average industrial wage for the period March 1996 to March 1997. <Col N="1200" /> This is consistent with the approach adopted in recent years to determine the increase in income limits.  I also applied this increase to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses in this regard has also been extended.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ongoing improvements in the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and increasing the income limits as resources permit. My priority in relation to the area of student support has been to honour the commitment given in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  I have honoured that commitment by way of introducting a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses.  The scheme was issued to VEC's in August and it is anticipated that the first payment to students, which will be retrospecitve to September, will be made not later than January 1999. The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the capitation charge is that, in the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standardised charge of £150 in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services.  Student services include health and welfare for students, students union and clubs and societies.  This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities that the true costs of the services would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted an increase in the charge to £250 for the 1997-8 academic year.  In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-9 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.</P>
    <P>I would point out that those students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>

      <P>My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.</P>
      <P>Under the schemes for the employment of secretaries and caretakers which were introduced in 1978 and 1979, my Department meets the full cost of salary and employer's PRSI.  These schemes are being phased out as posts become vacant and there is no provision for the appointment of full time secretaries or caretakers in posts which are being shared.</P>
      <P>Loreto primary school currently shares secretarial and caretaker posts with another primary school in Navan under the terms of the 1978 and 1979 schemes.  In the circumstances it will not be possible to sanction the appointment of a full-time secretary or caretaker to Loreto Primary School.</P>
      <P>Under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP), a second scheme was introduced in 1992 whereby my Department provides additional capitation grants towards the cost of caretaking and clerical services.</P>
      <P>Should either of the existing shared posts fall vacant, my Department will provide both schools with a grant of £15 per pupil per annum towards the cost of secretarial or caretaking services, subject to a maximum grant of £7,500 to each school in respect of each service, in accordance with the current terms of the PESP scheme.</P>

      <P>I should explain for the Deputy that special arrangements are made for candidates who would have a difficulty in communicating what they know to an examiner because of a physical disability, including visual and hearing impairments, or of a specific learning difficulty e.g. dyslexia.  The special arrangements are intended to remove, as far as possible, the impact of the disability on the candidate's performance and thus enable the candidate to demonstrate his or her level of attainment, as distinct from attempting to compensate in any way, for a lack of ability or knowledge on the part of the candidate.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to keep this area under review to ensure that proper allowances are made for candidates with special needs.</P>
      <P>I set up the Commission on the points system last year to look at the existing system of entry to third level education and to make recommendations for possible changes.  The Commission has engaged in an extensive consultation process and the issues raised by the Deputy have been raised in the debate.  The Commission is continuing its work and is aiming to report in the last spring/early summer next year.  I look forward to receiving its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of my Department's psychological service who are deployed in primary schools visit <Col N="1203" /> the schools assigned to them on a regular basis and carry out assessments as time allows.  The schools psychologists work in close collaboration with school principals and teachers in order to agree on which pupils should be given priority for assessment.  They do not operate a formal waiting list.  Pupils who are perceived to have the most urgent needs may therefore be seen without undue delay.  Where necessary, pupils are referred directly to the appropriate specialist agencies of the health authorities for further assessment and treatment.  Many pupils with special educational needs come within this category and are assessed by psychologists employed by the health boards or by voluntary bodies under their aegis.</P>
