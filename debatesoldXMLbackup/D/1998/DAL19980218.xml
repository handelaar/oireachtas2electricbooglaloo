      <P>On the Order of Business on 15 October the Taoiseach told the House that he expected to receive the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission by December 1997. When will this report be produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission produced an interim report some time ago and stated that it needed more time.  It gave a date for the final report which I cannot recall but I will inform the Deputy of the date during the day.</P>

      <P>We read in the newspapers today that the Minister for Finance and the Government have agreed to establish a working party with the Irish League of Credit Unions to examine proposals for the preparation of the next budget.  Does the Taoiseach intend to arrange a debate in the House on the report of that working group prior to the budget so as to avoid another calamity such as befell the Government last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The group will report at the end of September.  Like many groups reporting to the Minister in preparation for next year's budget and Finance Bill, the report will be considered by the Minister in the first instance.</P>

      <P>There is a case pending in the High Court this morning.  I am not precisely sure when that will be heard, nor are our representatives in court.  We are not a party to the case.  The papers which have been issued have put us on notice.  The House can be assured that the Government will do everything possible to keep the peace process and the talks moving forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has come to my attention this morning that the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Minister have reduced the length of time in which people can submit supplementary register forms for the by-election.  This measure has been introduced today with only two days left for people to submit the forms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  Until yesterday we did not know when the by-election would take place so people cannot get the forms in on time.  Will the Minister or the Taoiseach consider giving people another week to submit forms as the date of the by-election was only made known yesterday? A Cheann Comhairle, could I ask why you found it necessary to rule out a priority question to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the Ryanair dispute?  This is a very specific dispute but the question was ruled out on the basis that the matter was due for discussion on the Private Members' Trade Union Recognition Bill.  This Bill deals with a general policy area.  This is my first opportunity as Opposition spokesperson to ask the Minister about the Ryanair dispute on priority questions &mdash; the last priority questions were before Christmas.  Whatever about ruling out my questions on mandatory trade union membership, the Ryanair dispute is a separate issue from the general policy.  Can you restore this as a priority question?  I gave notice to your office that I would raise this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already communicated with the Deputy as to why the questions were disallowed.  This was done under Standing Order 34(6).  There is long standing precedent for this and we cannot have the ruling challenged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

The Competition Authority has struck down the agreement on commissions in the insurance industry which makes the decision of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to remove the requirement for disclosure of commission wholly untenable.  Following the squeezing out of the Ombudsman in the context of the insurance industry, is it the intention of the Taoiseach to reintroduce the legislation prepared when the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, was appointed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I dealt with the contributions of Fianna Fáil Deputies who had contributed to the debate.  Specifically I dealt with the fact that they seem aggrieved because of the unanimous description of the budget and the Finance Bill outside the House as favouring the rich. It is suggested that it has blatantly skewed the tax code in favour of the better off.  To support that point of view, I quoted the conclusions of the Conference of Religious in Ireland who set out their basis for alleging that this has been the most divisive budget introduced in recent years and it has exacerbated the gap between the well off and those on lower to middle incomes.  Some Fianna Fáil Deputies evinced a great deal of heartache that the Finance Bill should be described in that fashion.  The Finance Bill faithfully reflects the measures outlined on budget day.  It includes additional measures to which the Minister has drawn attention &mdash; he indicated a number of important areas where he wishes to bring forward amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that, having moved the date forward for the budget, the Minister told the House on Second Stage that, in respect of major parts of the Bill, it is his intention to put forward on Committee Stage significant amendments which the Opposition spokespersons will then see for the first time.  The Finance Bill is notorious for being the subject of lobbying.  It is inevitable that vested interest groups will seek to influence the terms of the Finance Bill from those announced on budget day.  It is entirely unacceptable that at the last minute the Minister should come into the House with a new raft of highly complex amendments and the Opposition spokespersons are expected, on the hoof, to respond to them.  As recently as 1994 the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, brought in an amendment at the end of four days on Committee Stage to change the residential requirements for tax exiles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of what Government takes such action, I do not defend the practice. Amendments introduced during the period I was in Government did not have the dubious connotations of the provision in respect of tax exiles.</P>
      <P>In general the Finance Bill flies in the face of the pre-budget consensus that tax relief ought to be targeted at lower to middle income earners and should continue to facilitate the recent impetus to ease the transition from welfare to work.  The decision by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to skew the tax measures for the benefit of high and super earners was further exacerbated by his completely unexpected and as yet inadequately explained decision to halve capital gains tax.  That decision has rubbed salt in the wounds of the hundreds of thousands of workers who have borne the brunt of the income tax burden in the past two decades and who reasonably expected to be the focus of significant relief on this occasion, given the propitious public finances position inherited by the Minister from the previous Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister then decided to add insult to injury by mounting an unprecedented assault on small savers in credit unions and refusing to take tangible action to cope with the flood of tax evasion scandals alleged in connection with certain financial institutions.  The Minister's decision to narrow or limit certain tax avoidance shelters is presented as tackling those scandals, but it does nothing of the kind.  The credit union debacle is most revealing in that it betrays the mindset of the Government.  After eight short months it has apparently grown remote from ordinary people, is shown to know little about small savers and to care less.</P>
      <P>I accept the logic of those who argue that the attack on the credit union movement is perfectly consistent with the track record of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, as the author of the infamous dirty dozen cuts in social welfare.  That, however, does not explain why he was permitted by Government to take a sledge hammer to the credit union movement.  The vain attempt by the Taoiseach to resile from complicity in this petty deed is entirely lacking in credibility, given that the Finance Bill was approved by the Cabinet.  It is an extraordinary commentary on this whole affair that not a single member of the Cabinet has supported the decision of the Minister for Finance. The Taoiseach sought, in his only public comment, to resile from the decision taken.  That gives the impression to the public, which is presumably the purpose, that the assault on the credit union movement and the small saver was either a Progressive Democrats manoeuvre or a solo run by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public ought to be told and to understand that Finance Bills cannot come before the House without being approved by Cabinet.  I am sure a sub-committee of Ministers dealt with the detail of the Finance Bill before it was introduced.  It is wrong for spin doctors to insinuate that the Department of Finance is the <Col N="653" /> author of this decision.  This was a political decision taken at the Cabinet table by a Government that is out of touch, in the full knowledge of the provisions of the Finance Bill, and the Taoiseach and each Minister is as culpable as is the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. It is wrong to imply that the move came from the Department of Finance in Merrion Street. This matter came to light at the time I introduced the Credit Union Act, 1997.  I am aware of what transpired on that occasion &mdash; I had an informal agreement with the Department of Finance.  That Department cannot be blamed for this measure.  It was a political decision, from which the Minister had to climb down.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable, after eight months in office, the party of the plain people does not have a single representative at the Cabinet table who is in touch with ordinary people.  It seems the Taoiseach will be obliged to find a place in Cabinet for Deputy Healy-Rae rather than permit him to continue to determine Government policy from outside.  Deputy Healy-Rae is the humane face of the Government, and long may he thrive.  The disturbing question remains, however, would the climb-down on credit unions have come about were there not two critical by-elections in prospect?</P>
    <P>The sheer panic of the Government in the face of the uprising of the credit union movement is evident from three developments: the attempt by the Taoiseach to repudiate complicity, the unprecedented publication by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, of private correspondence from the league and the emergence of Deputy O'Malley to protest that &ldquo;this was not a PD decision&rdquo; and to seek to leave the impression that the first port of call of the average Progressive Democrats member is the local credit union.  None of those panic responses is credible and they do not reflect credit on the Government parties.</P>
    <P>That was a bridge too far for ordinary people who, in the main, are not experts on the workings of the Stock Exchange but understand perfectly well when, for example, four company directors benefit in a single transaction, to the tune of almost £1 million, from the slashing of capital gains tax.  Ordinary people understand that, but they cannot understand why the few bob on which they have already paid tax ought to be subject to the punitive measures suggested by the Minister and that pensioners and older people who were in the habit of saving throughout their lives ought to be required, for the first time in the history of financial institutions, to reveal their dividend earnings to the Revenue Commissioners. This measure does not apply to any other financial institution in the State notwithstanding what has been revealed about some financial institutions recently.  No other financial institution has had such an obligation imposed on it.  This Government chose to make a start with the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>It suited Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats when the Progressive Democrats were <Col N="654" /> claimed to have been the authors of the particularly harsh and regressive tax measures in the recent budget.  That was good for what remained of the Progressive Democrats macho image but, as they fight in the heartland of the party founder's constituency in the by-election, they are determined not to accept blame for the credit union debacle.  Faster than one could produce a phoney opinion poll, the Progressive Democrats set out to drop the Minister in the mire.  There is no doubt that the disgust publicly expressed by the secretary of the Minister's own comhairle ceantar is typical, not only of the reaction of most voters, but of the response of ordinary Fianna Fáil members.  It would have suited Fianna Fáil to let the Progressive Democrats take the blame for that but Deputy O'Malley is determined that should not happen.</P>
    <P>Following his announcement in the House yesterday, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has been routed by the plain people of Ireland in a manner reminiscent of the rout at Vinegar Hill in 1798, at least until after the by-elections and for the rest of 1998.  The Minister, for all his protestations, does not understand the mutual self-help philosophy of the credit unions or the fact that the 1997 Credit Union Act will accelerate the rate of reinvestment in local communities.  That is a critical point.  Allied Irish Banks today announced profits in the region of £580 million which amounts to more that £10 million profit per week.  In Single Market conditions, it is important that our banking institutions, such as they are, have a certain critical mass.  I am not commenting one way or another on that although there are many points which could be made about it on another occasion.  One of the major features of the new Credit Union Act is that it enables the credit union movement to reinvest shareholders' money for productive purposes in local communities.</P>
    <P>It is extremely regrettable that the Minister has attempted to halt the growth of the credit union movement and to halt that mutually beneficial, community based, self-help ethos which has driven the credit union movement to the pinnacle lauded by some 40 Fianna Fáil Deputies when they attempted to talk the Bill, which I introduced, into the lifetime of this Government prior to the general election.  Each of the Deputies came into this House and made roughly the same speech, produced by the press office, with the names of their own local credit unions inserted at the relevant points.  I am not questioning the commitment of Fianna Fáil backbenchers to the credit union movement or their ultimate support for the Bill as it passed through the House, but where were those Fianna Fáil backbenchers when the Minister took the knife to the credit union movement?  That is a question which must be asked and it is one I notice has not been addressed by the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address a number of issues and, having been prodded by the Minister, I would now like to address the issue of capital gains tax.  The unprecedented slashing of capital gains tax from 40 to 20 per cent is extraordinary. Has the Ceann Comhairle, as the longest serving Member of the House, ever witnessed a tax being slashed in half?  Has there ever been a situation where a tax has been reduced from 40 to 20 per cent?  The Minister argues that this measure is in the interests of the economy.  It may well be in the interests of some very wealthy party supporters of certain Members of the House but it is certainly not in the interests of the economy.  This type of decision is the last thing this economy needs at this time.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with one particular aspect of this issue.  Last week a woman who lives quite near Deputy Ardagh attended one of my local clinics and informed me that she was completely bemused by her local authority's decision not to sanction the sale of her tenant-purchased house. The woman, who wished to move back to the country, purchased the house ten or 15 years ago and, as she understood it, had successfully sold it. When I contacted the local authority I was informed it had indeed vetoed the sale and refused to sanction it.  I inquired why this had happened and was informed that the purchaser of the house, unknown to the local authority, had already purchased several houses in the same area.  Houses are being bought up by corporate and individual investors and young married couples seeking to put together the wherewithal to buy their first home cannot compete with them.  The first impact of the Government's decision to slash capital gains is that it is driving an already spiralling house market out of control and beyond the reach of young people who would normally aspire to achieve ownership of their own house on a 25 year mortgage.  That is now being put beyond their reach and as a result these people end up on the housing list.  That is one of the reasons the housing list is growing.  Normally, two working people would expect to be able to get a mortgage commensurate with the purchase of a modest house.  However, as a result of this measure, they are being prevented from doing so and it seems the Minister's changes in capital gains tax have only served to fuel this vicious spiral to the detriment of young people trying to buy their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I believe must be asked when examining these changes is <i>qui bono</i>?  Who benefits from these changes?  Who asked the Minister to make them?  I defy any Member of this House to find anything on record which reveals that a Deputy on either side ever asked a Minister to slash capital gains tax in half, by way of parliamentary question, adjournment matter or even throwaway remark?  I do not believe there is any <Col N="656" /> such record.  The members of the credit union movement certainly did not ask the Minister to make these changes.</P>
    <P>The tax changes to be implemented through the Finance Bill are designed to give the greatest benefit to high and super high earners.  Instead of focusing the available £500 million on low and middle income earners, the Minister opted for the Progressive Democrats' demand to reduce the rates.  Two months after the Budget Statement it is interesting to study the data being made available by way of replies to parliamentary questions. The Minister's projection on budget day that the capital gains tax changes would cost £20 million has already increased to £40 million.  Similarly, and despite protestations to the contrary, the 37 per cent of the working population paying tax at the higher rate in the 1997-98 tax year will increase to 38.2 per cent in the tax year 1998-99.</P>
    <P>The issue for those middle income earners was never a reduction from 48 per cent to 46 per cent but to have a greater proportion of their income liable to taxation at the standard rate.  At the lower end of the scale, the issue was, first, how many people would be removed from the tax net and, second, to keep thousands of workers on middle incomes clear of the marginal rate through the use of a combination of personal allowances and widening the tax bands.  The demands of tax equity required no less.  Above all, the changes I advocate would have made it worthwhile for more people to take up employment in the lower paid sectors.  The Government does not understand this critical point.</P>
    <P>I have respect for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  However, he comes from the same Fianna Fáil stable as the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  Given the best will in the world to both, which I have, they ought not have those portfolios.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, does not understand the interaction of the social welfare code with the tax code.  The policy thrust of recent years was to assist progress from welfare to work.  We hear a great deal of whinging about the number of jobs being advertised in shop windows in Grafton Street.  In truth, many of these jobs are lower paid and there is a substantial problem of low pay in certain sectors.  However, to facilitate the progress of people from welfare to work in those low paid sectors, it was necessary to continue the thrust of the improvements initiated by the previous Government.  That is one of the major casualties of the Minister's decision to concentrate the bulk of the £500 million on tax rates for top earners.</P>
    <P>Middle income earners have borne the brunt of financing the public services of the State for many years.  They might reasonably have expected in the current propitious circumstances to be given the bulk of the relief.  That did not happen.  It is not a question of reducing one's tax from 48 per cent to 46 per cent and I cannot explain why this point is not understood.  The issue is how much of <Col N="657" /> one's income one is paying at the standard rate, whether it be 26, 25 or 24 per cent.  The Minister had that decision in his gift.  The important taxation issues are: how soon does one become liable for tax, for how long does one pay tax at the marginal rate and at what level of income does one enter the marginal rate.  That is the test the Minister failed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision regarding VAT on magazines.  The Minister should consider asking the Competition Authority to carry out a study on whether there is real competition, if the consumer is getting the benefit of the decision to reduce VAT and if there is real competition <i>vis-à-vis</i> the exchange rates and the consequent benefits being passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about how the Minister phrased his remarks on corporation profits tax.  Is he saying there is still doubt about reinforcing the decision of the previous Government with regard to corporation profits tax?  I also seek clarification with regard to changing the ten year rule on VAT to six years.  The Minister said that for reasons of equity the reduced time limit will also apply to VAT assessments by the Revenue Commissioners. Does he mean there are VAT assessments outstanding for longer than six years?  Do some date back to ten years and, if so, why and what are the implications of changing the rule from ten to six years?</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte did not refer to the increase of £5 in the old age pension.  In my constituency, Dublin South-Central, an excellent and hard working colleague of Deputy Rabbitte did not succeed in the last election.  I believe that in spite of the tremendous efforts of that former Deputy his defeat was caused by the actions of the leader of Democratic Left who, as Minister for Social Welfare for two years, did not offer pensioners the increase provided by the Minister this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must reply to Deputy Rabbitte's outrageous and ill-informed comments concerning the credit unions.  I visited a credit union with a large number of members in Deputy Rabbitte's constituency. I asked how many people would be affected by the proposed imposition of DIRT.  The reply was &ldquo;none&rdquo;.  I further asked how many people would be affected by the reporting of £500 dividends. Again, the reply was &ldquo;none&rdquo;.  I suspect that in both Deputy Rabbitte's and my constituencies the total number of people who would have been affected by the proposals which have now been dropped could be counted on the fingers of one hand.  The proposals were an attack on large savers who are abusing the taxation exemptions of the credit union movement.  All abuses, whether they are facilitated by off-shore bank accounts, <Col N="658" /> Ansbacher accounts or credit unions, should be dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Finance Bill, 1998, is an important step in the implementation of the Action Programme for the Millennium.  The Bill addresses many of the points set out in that programme under the seven key concerns of the people.  The reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 26 per cent to 24 per cent and in the higher rate of tax from 48 per cent to 46 per cent gives confidence to taxpayers that the Government will reduce the basic rate of income tax to 20 per cent and the higher rate to 42 per cent over its four year term.  The Finance Bill sets the course for this to become a reality.</P>
    <P>I am particularly impressed by the provisions which encourage the long-term unemployed to take up employment.  I hope increased personal allowances claimable by the long-term unemployed person and the double deduction allowance claimable by the employer will be incentives to both employers and the long-term unemployed to work together to reduce the numbers on the dole queues.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 there is provision for a relief from tax for donations made to or for the benefit of designated schools.  I am concerned that the managers of and parents of children attending schools in areas such as Crumlin, Drimnagh, Dolphin's Barn and Fatima Mansions, which I represent and where there is substantial disadvantage, will be unable to attract the type of donations which schools in other more affluent areas might be able to attract.  In this regard, I ask the Minister to consider establishing an independent trust which would, on the basis of need, allocate funds to schools.  Donations to the trust should be tax allowable.  If donations were made to the trust instead of to individual schools the result would be a fairer allocation of its resources.</P>
    <P>Every Member recognises that the sacrifices, taxes and efforts of our older citizens helped to create the economic prosperity we now enjoy.  I am delighted with the increase of £5 per week in the old age pension.  Section 17 of the Bill which grants capital allowances in respect of capital expenditure on the construction, extension or refurbishment of buildings used as private registered nursing homes is a welcome proposal. There is a great need for more nursing homes to be available at a reasonable cost.  This section which allows for capital allowances for building nursing homes will enable us to create more spaces which will help us to care for and assist old people.</P>
    <P>In my maiden speech to Dáil Éireann, I pointed out the ways in which wealthy people were getting wealthier by avoiding tax.  I am delighted that steps have now been taken to reduce the potential to avoid tax, particularly in relation to capital allowances.</P>
    <P>Section 24 limits the amount an individual can set off against his non-rental income to £25,000 in any tax year.  This restriction should result in higher income earners being unable to use tax <Col N="659" /> avoidance schemes to minimise the amount of tax they would otherwise have to pay.  Prior to the implementation of section 24 advantageous incentives were available to investors to provide hotels in Dublin, Galway and other areas where they would increase in value and have high occupancy rates.  Hotels in these areas will now be built on the basis of commerciality.  This section also provides an incentive to build hotels in areas where they are still needed, in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo.  This is good as it will help to spread the business of tourism throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There are huge complications in explaining tax dates to taxpayers.  For example, the 1996-7 return was to be submitted by 31 January 1998, preliminary tax for 1998-9 is due for payment on 1 November 1998 and the 1997-8 tax return is due on 31 January 1999.  The change in the date for filing tax returns from 31 January to the previous 30 November will help to bring taxpayers and their taxation affairs more up to date, which is preferred by taxpayers and Revenue.</P>
    <P>Linking the date for payment for preliminary tax to the filing date for tax returns on 30 November is also welcome.  Tax practitioners are reluctant to accept the change because of holidays and examination timetables.  These problems will have to be overcome as it is in the best interests of the clients of these practitioners to go ahead with the changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion to put the tax year on a calendar year basis will radically simplify matters for taxpayers.  Taxpayers are the clients of the Revenue Commissioners and every effort should be made to make the system easier to operate and more transparent.</P>
    <P>Section 787 of the Principal Act allows some latitude in the payment of retirement annuity premiums. At present, payments can be made, in respect of a tax year, up to 31 January following. The new section 38 will limit this to some extent, as it brings the date forward to 30 November following. This means that some people will have to catch up on two months retirement annuity premium payments if they are making payments on a monthly basis.  Perhaps the Minister may consider a transitional arrangement which would in some measure limit the inconvenience this change will cause to some taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in the rate of corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent for the standard rate.  I particularly welcome the reduction to 25 per cent for the first £50,000 of a company's income.  Most small companies have an income of less than £50,000 and this will encourage the owners of small companies to reinvest the profits in the business.  It is a problem that many small companies are under-capitalised and as a result of this initiative the capitalisation of companies in Ireland will improve.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides a new scheme to allow tax deduction to companies for certain company <Col N="660" /> donations to eligible charities.  I am concerned about the provision in the section which states that the charity would need to have been granted exemption from tax for three years prior to its application for authorisation.  In my constituency, the Templeogue House Development Committee Limited is anxious to improve and renovate Templeogue Castle.  This excellent cause will cost the local community £100,000 to £200,000, which can only be raised through sponsorship and company donations.  The committee was formed in July 1995 and did not apply to the Revenue Commissioners for charitable status exemption, as it is only with the advent of this new scheme that the need arises.  I ask the Minister to consider an amendment to take this kind of worthwhile development into account.</P>
    <P>Section 48 provides for new relief for corporate investment in renewable energy projects.  This scheme allows corporate investors to invest up to £10 million per annum.  Rules similar to the BES rules apply and corporate investors need to hold shares for at least five years to ensure that the relief is not withdrawn.  I note the Minister is giving a period of three years for these investments to be made.  I wish the concept and all of the projects which result from this section every success.</P>
    <P>We realise the cost of cars is very high in Ireland and I welcome the reduction in the vehicle registration tax announced in the Bill.  It is interesting that under section 64, if a vehicle is converted from that with an engine capacity less than 2,500cc to that with an engine capacity greater than 2,500cc extra vehicle registration tax is payable.  If one is found to be in possession of a vehicle which has been converted from a lower to a higher vehicle registration tax category, that offence may result in the forfeiture of the vehicle. This section also applies to the conversion of a car van to a car.</P>
    <P>Section 66 amends an 1860 Act which states &ldquo;.no licence to sell foreign wine by retail to be consumed on the premises shall be granted for any refreshment house which, with the premises belonging thereto and occupied herewith, shall be under the value of eight pounds a year.&rdquo; This outdated terminology is still in our legislation and highlights the need to modernise and update our tax laws.  I am delighted the rate of VAT imposed on magazines and periodicals will be reduced to 12.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note from section 97 that the reason banks say it is cheaper to use a standing order or direct debit rather than a cheque or a bank draft is not because the banks are making it cheaper but because the stamp duty is less.  There is no stamp duty on standing orders or direct debits while on cheques and bank drafts it is 7 pence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the capital acquisitions tax in relation to the inheritance of a house by an elderly person from a deceased brother or sister. There has been a marked improvement in the exemption level.  I ask the Minister to consider further extending the relief where the inheritor of <Col N="661" /> a house is a close friend of the deceased owner and both have been living in the house for at least ten years prior to the date of the inheritance.</P>
    <P>The question of solicitors and counsel having tax clearance certificates arose recently at the Committee of Public Accounts in relation to their work for the criminal legal aid scheme.  I commend the Minister for introducing section 108 which requires, where appropriate, solicitors and counsel to hold a tax clearance certificate from the Collector General.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the decisions of the appeals commissioners will now be published in those cases which are considered appropriate. Generally, this will be where the tax matter in question is of interest to tax practitioners and taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I am always amazed at the provision in section 112 that all taxes and duties imposed by this Act are hereby placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  This effectively means that even though we pass all of these Acts, if it suits, the Revenue Commissioners can, in individual cases, decide to change all of them.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak on the Finance Bill which gives effect to, among other things, the budget tax cuts.  The Bill confirms, in legislative form, the reduction in the tax rates for 1 million taxpayers by 2 percentage points, resulting in substantial increases in take home pay for ordinary PAYE workers from 6 April.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides for a greater degree of effective tax equity by cutting back on tax shelters such as the BES and certain capital investment reliefs.  It gives a boost to productive enterprise and endeavour through the reductions in the corporation tax and capital gains tax rates and new reliefs for nursing homes, the whitefish fishing fleet and renewable energy projects, to name but a few.  The Bill also contains many technical and other changes to our tax law.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the main features of the Bill. The first part of it deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The changes in tax rates, bands and allowances, income tax exemption limits and the increased widowed bereavement allowance announced in the budget are dealt with in the first few sections.  These provide substantial increases in take home pay for PAYE workers, all the more so when combined with Partnership 2000 pay increases.  A single person on £5,000 per annum will gain nearly 6 per cent more in take home pay with an assumed 2.25 per cent pay increase under Partnership 2000.  A single person on £12,000 per annum will receive 5 per cent in take home pay on the same basis.  A married couple with one earner and two children on £12,000 per annum will be better off by more than 6 per cent after the Partnership 2000 and 1998 budget pay and tax package.  The same married couple on £24,000 per annum will see their net income increase by nearly 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over two years the gain as a percentage of net <Col N="662" /> income, taking the 1997 and 1998 budgets in association with the basic pay increases of the first and second phases of Partnership 2000, will range from 9.5 per cent to 11.5 per cent for single full rate PRSI contributors and from 8.5 per cent to 12.5 per cent for the married couple referred to above.  These are substantial gains by any standard, yet the Opposition is trying to run them down.  I presume it realises its failure to deal significantly with the tax system while it was in Government.  There was only a 1 per cent reduction in overall tax rates during its period in office.</P>
    <P>There are cutbacks on certain well used tax shelters to ensure a fairer distribution of the tax burden.  This is hardly the action of a Government portrayed by some Members opposite as cutting capital gains tax simply to enrich the better off.  I have been given examples of high earners on £300,000 per annum who could, using the tax shelters we have acted on in the budget, reduce their taxable income to under £25,000 and pay tax of about £7,000.  A total of £7,000 tax on an income of £300,000 is some going.  Tax reliefs have a role to play and I support them when they are well focused, but they can be abused and misused.</P>
    <P>I support the tax relief provided for in section 18 on investment in the renewal, improvement or reinstatement of vessels in the whitefish fishing fleet.  This will help many fishing communities around the coast.  This relief will not only renew the boats but make them safer.  It will also play its part as a focused scheme of rural renewal, given the location of most of the main fishing ports.  This is an innovative measure and demonstrates how one can be focused when introducing tax measures aimed specifically at a vibrant and important working community, but disadvantaged in many respects because of its location around our coast.</P>
    <P>Section 37 proposes changes to the self-assessment system that will align the pay and file dates at 30 November each year, starting with 30 November 1999.  The current arrangements for the payment of tax and the filing of returns are extremely complicated with a multiplicity of dates.  I know that a body of tax practitioners are concerned at this change.  I know also that other practitioners support this change.  However, in recognition of the possibility of some difficulties arising with these new arrangements, the Minister has agreed to make the section subject to a commencement order to give taxpayers time to sort out matters and allow a fuller impact assessment to be made before proceeding.  This should satisfy the concerns that have been expressed.</P>
    <P>The changes to self-assessment are accompanied by reductions in the rate of interest charged by Revenue on overdue tax and by provision for publication of appeal commissioners' decisions.  Also as part of the package, Revenue are prepared to cut down on the number and volume of documents, certificates, returns and other paperwork required to be filed with the annual <Col N="663" /> accounts.  I am sure that when all these changes are taken in the round, the fears of accountants and practitioners will be put to rest.  The amount of paperwork involved in filing accounts has been a cause of concern for many, particularly small traders.  The Government is determined to reduce as far as practicable the level and volume of paperwork involved in filing tax returns and other correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Another important feature in the Bill is the technical measures in section 39 and Schedule 2 which deal with the proposed introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999.  The Government has decided to set out these changes well in advance of the euro date so that firms and their advisers will be clear on where they stand.  This is consistent with the clear and organised euro campaign which we have undertaken to prepare the ground for the change-over.  Companies and individuals are now more aware of the advancing date for the euro and the fact that we will be a participant. It is important, therefore, that all companies avail of the vast amount of information that is available in various guises in the public domain and plan their requirements consistently with the commencement of the euro in January l999.</P>
    <P>Sections 43 to 48 deal with corporation tax. These give effect to the reduction in corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent and from 28 per cent to 25 per cent in respect of the first £50,000 of the company profits announced in the budget with effect from 1 January 1998.  There are also new reliefs for company donations to charities and investment by companies in certain renewable energy projects.  The latter relief must be cleared with the EU prior to its coming into effect.  There are a number of other reliefs proposed in the Bill that require notification to, or State aid approval by, the EU Commission.  The Commission has shown that it is receptive to these tax initiatives and we hope to get the necessary clearances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan may have misheard or misread what the Minister said yesterday on the single low rate of corporation tax.  He made it clear that the single low rate of corporation tax is agreed with the Commission.  What is being discussed with the Commission is the planned timetable for achieving that low rate.  This had not been put to bed by the previous Administration.  The Minister clearly said &ldquo;single low rate&rdquo; not a single lower rate, as Deputy Noonan alleged and from which he seemed to imply some change in what had been previously announced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In regard to the single rate of corporation tax, discussions are continuing with the Commission to secure their final sign up on the planned timetable for achieving that single low rate.</P>

      <P>I am trying to clarify a specific point raised by Deputy Noonan last night.  The Minister did not say &ldquo;lower rate&rdquo;, he said &ldquo;single low rate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On CGT, a lot has been made of the reduction in the rate to 20 per cent.  This, it is claimed, is a sop to the wealthy.  Interestingly, new Labour in the UK seems to be considering CGT reductions, but we will have to wait until 17 March, its budget day, to see if it will follow our lead.  What does the Opposition want?  Does it want wealth tied up generating very little or wealth released to reinvest, generate more productive activity and ultimately jobs?  I know what the public prefers in this regard.</P>
      <P>Looking at indirect taxation sections 92 and 93 contain important new provisions on the assessment and refund of VAT.  We have seen increased activity by tax planners both here and in other member states seeking to exploit the opportunities in EU VAT law for new interpretations of VAT provisions.  The yield from VAT is considerable &mdash; about £4 billion per annum.</P>
      <P>Successful VAT planning could be costly to the Exchequer.  We must, therefore, reduce the exposure of the Exchequer to claims for VAT refund by reducing the time limit within which a VAT refund may be claimed from ten years to six years.  For reasons of equity, section 93 also applies the reduced time limit to VAT assessments by the Revenue Commissioners.  The new period will correspond with the existing general legal requirement for traders to keep books and records for six years.</P>
      <P>Section 92 clarifies the rules designed to avoid windfall gains which may occur with VAT repayments. These rules are usually referred to as &ldquo;unjust enrichment&rdquo; rules and are designed to ensure that VAT refunds do not simply end up in traders' pockets with no benefit to the consumer who ultimately pays VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the taxation of credit union savings I am pleased the issue was resolved but a number of important points should be made.  Credit union interest and dividends are subject to income tax at the recipient's marginal rate.  This income should be reported by the person receiving it.  I note, for example, a correspondent in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> from Tramore who stated that he returned his dividend and interest to the Revenue and was charged at the full rate. He felt it not only fair but his duty to do so.  That letter is worth reading for the observations it makes on the issue of reporting taxable income generally.  The proposals in the Bill would not <Col N="665" /> have imposed new taxation.  Their removal as announced yesterday does not lift tax off credit unions as some reports say.  It is a matter of going back largely to the <i>status quo.</i>  The Bill still exempts credit unions from corporation tax which is worth at least £15 million per annum to them in total.  I have great regard for the credit union but taxation has to be applied fairly.  I am sure the working group to be set up will take a broad view in reconciling credit union concerns with the wider issues involved.</P>
    <P>The changes in tax on savings income are on hold and the working group will explore these taxation issues, bearing in mind the special nature of the credit union movement and its contribution to society.  I commend the Minister for these proposals which offer a reasonable basis for addressing the issue of credit union taxation.</P>
    <P>There are many welcome and positive features in this Bill, some of which I have referred to.  This is well balanced legislation which confirms the easing of the tax burden on the PAYE sector while restricting tax breaks for the better off.  It provides a sound basis for the continued success of our economy and I give it my full and wholehearted support.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, claim credit for the tax reliefs delivered in the budget makes me smile. The Minister of State being a fair minded person would not totally accept that and no doubt is just making a political statement.  In his budget last year the Minister delivered in excess of £400 million to taxpayers but directed the benefits towards the lower paid to widen the tax wedge between those who opt for social welfare or work.  I would much prefer a continuation of that policy in this budget and Finance Bill than what has transpired.</P>
      <P>On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night I saw the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy try to defend his action on taxation of credit union savings and his U-turn.  He mentioned that he had delivered £500 million to taxpayers.  That is gross hypocrisy when one considers that he was operating off the previous budget, the previous Estimates and the previous Finance Bill.  From June to November when the Minister introduced his budget he had managed the economy based on what the previous Government had done.  The tax breaks before us have been delivered because of the revenue buoyancy from the previous Government.  In my budget contribution I drew the analogy between the Minister taking over such a buoyant economy and a manager taking over a football team such as Manchester United or the All Blacks who had come to our shores at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and were regarded as the best All Blacks team ever to come here.  It is similar to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, taking over the economy as presented to him.  I notice with Manchester United that a few chinks are appearing.  Similarities could be drawn between the slice kick of Schmeichel and the gap made by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, as regards the credit union proposal.  I do not want to dwell on it here but it is the greatest U-turn I have ever witnessed since coming into this House. The Minister has been embarrassed and has got no support from his colleagues.  I note that none of his colleagues has come out in defence of the way he handled it.  Certainly the Minister will think in future before he shoots from the hip as he is accustomed to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, was selective as was the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, yesterday, in identifying people who will benefit under the present arrangements.  I will briefly look at the effect the tax changes will have on several sectors of the community.  The Government has failed to recognise the role played by the lower paid in creating revenue buoyancy by attracting foreign investment interested in providing some low paid jobs.  People work in retail outlets and in the tourism industry in many provincial towns and are creating revenue buoyancy throughout the economy.  These are the people who should have benefited from the tax changes in the budget.  Research carried out by the Conference of Religious in Ireland shows that single people on £40,000 will benefit three times more than a single person on £10,000.  It is interesting that there are only 4,198 single people in the £40,000 to £50,000 gross income bracket while the number of single people in the £10,000 to £12,500 is 84,000.  The same research shows that married taxpayers in the £40,000 to £50,000 income bracket benefit twice as much as married taxpayers in the £20,000 to £25,000 bracket.</P>
      <P>There are 36,253 in the higher bracket compared to 78,375 in the lower bracket.  It is obvious, therefore, that a relatively small number of wealthy individuals will benefit disproportionately from the main personal tax reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>If one pays three or four times more in tax, one will benefit proportionately. That is logical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is spouting the philosophy of the Progressive Democrats, the party from which he ran.  It is obvious that he has much influence.  The bottom line is that those in low paid jobs will not benefit to the same extent as those in high paid jobs.  Therein lies the problem.  The question is whether they will make <Col N="667" /> a decision to stay on social welfare or to work. The only way they can receive more from employers is through the taxation system.  The strategy proposed by the rainbow Government before the election of expanding tax bands and improving personal allowances would be much more beneficial to the vast majority of taxpayers.</P>
      <P>A number of people, not all of them accountants, have been in contact with me regarding the proposal in section 37 to bring forward the date by which the self-employed must file their tax returns.  The self-employed, including sole traders and farmers, must file their tax returns by 31 January. The work of completing accounts and preparing returns is traditionally undertaken by businesses and their tax advisers in the months September to January.  This change, if implemented, will cut the time available for this important work by 40 per cent.  According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, this may result in chaos in the administration of the taxation system and delays in the collection of taxes.  The president of the institute, Mr. Tom Griffin, said the proposed change has not been thought through.  The Minister should allay its concerns on Committee Stage.  The findings of a survey of its members on this issue conducted in 1997 showed that 87 per cent were opposed to this proposal.</P>
      <P>The current practice of filing tax returns by the end of January is a tried and trusted system which has worked well over the years.  The proposed change is unworkable and likely to lead to hastily prepared returns which may be less reliable and inevitably lead to more correspondence with the Revenue Commissioners.  According to the ICAI &mdash; I have no reason to disagree with it &mdash; the Revenue Commissioners rely heavily on the co-operation and assistance of accountants for the effective administration of the taxation system. This proposal will damage that co-operation and assistance.  It will not bring in one penny more in extra taxation; if anything, it will lead to more correspondence and delays in finalising the tax affairs of the self-employed.  It should, therefore, be looked at again.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the new pilot relief scheme in defined rural areas, which I welcome, and the new urban renewal scheme.  When Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food with responsibility for rural development I established an advisory group which, in page 54 of its report, strongly recommended the introduction of a pilot relief scheme because of the outflow of funds from rural areas.  Farmers, shopkeepers and others in rural areas are investing in designated areas in the larger towns and cities as well as the designated tourist resorts. If there was an incentive to invest in their own areas, they would do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the scheme will be confined to the upper Shannon basin.  Shannon Development has made a thorough submission to the Department of Finance relating to the lower Shannon basin. <Col N="668" /> The Shannon Estuary Development Company was established before the previous Government left office.  The submission recommends the introduction of a pilot tax scheme to enable Shannon Development to raise private capital to develop its underdeveloped industrial land banks.  The money would be used to fund site preparation and key infrastructure necessary to attract foreign industrial investment to the region.  It is suggested that the scheme should be introduced initially at the largest greenfield site at Ballylongford, County Kerry.  If successful, it should be extended to the two remaining sites at Askeaton, County Limerick and Kilrush, County Clare.</P>
    <P>This is a futuristic proposal.  I will table amendments on Committee Stage to ensure it is implemented and to put pressure on the Fianna Fáil members who represent the area affected to test their commitment.  The proposal should have a beneficial economic impact and result in the creation of a large number of jobs.  The land bank at Ballylongford which encompasses 925 acres of public land has remained underdeveloped for the past 15 to 20 years.  High expectations were raised in the past.  This proposal would provide the necessary kick-start to ensure it is developed.</P>
    <P>As regards the new urban renewal scheme, the Minister is being unfair to smaller provincial towns in setting a population threshold of 6,000. Listowel, which has a population of 4,000, and Caherciveen, the home town of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, would benefit greatly from such a scheme.  Tralee and Killarney have already benefited. They are buoyant and vibrant towns.  I hope the Minister will not only review the 6,000 population threshold but will make exceptions to it provided a good plan is proposed by the towns involved.  In that event provision should be made for their inclusion in the scheme which is an important vehicle for local development.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to section 21.  I thank the Minister for extending the termination date of the seaside resort scheme to June 1999, but the changes he and the previous Minister introduced are making the scheme less attractive.  I accept in some instances the scheme was not used for the purposes for which it was put in place.  Nevertheless, in a seaside resort like Ballybunion where the scheme is just beginning to take effect, removing some of the incentives will render it less effective.  I would like the Minister to consider exceptional cases, such as Ballybunion where there is a proposal to build a large hotel, to ensure the benefits and attractions of the scheme, which will be extended under the Finance Bill, will be availed of and decisions to build that type of development in those resorts will not be reversed.</P>
    <P>Section 55, which affords capital gains tax roll over relief in respect of the disposal of financial assets by certain sporting bodies, is very welcome. Section 57 extends to greyhound racing tracks roll over relief on the disposal of development land where the proceeds are reinvested in race track <Col N="669" /> facilities.  No doubt that refers to Cork greyhound track.  I was involved in initiating the provision of the new track for Cork although I notice the Minister for Agriculture and Food is slow to acknowledge that whenever he refers to it in articles reported in <i>The Examiner.</i>  I hope when Deputy Dennehy speaks to my friend in Cork he will remind him that it was I who suggested there should be a new greyhound racing track in Cork. I was delighted the university bought the land of the old track because it needed it for development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an example of the usual helpful Kerry approach to Cork's problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  I am delighted roll over relief will be extended to it and it will not be taxed in this regard.  Regarding the track in Harold's Cross which involves crucial development land, it is important that the revenue that will accrue from the sale of some of that site should go towards developing the remaining tracks in the country.  I am pleased about those provisions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan and I will table an amendment to one of the sections in Part IV on stamp duty for first time buyers.  We will propose that it be reduced to nil or by £6,000 whichever is the lower.  That would cover the stamp duty cost of a reasonable first time home at £100,000 or less.  It is proposed that relief should be given where a person shows to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that he or she did not previously own or have a beneficial interest in a house or an apartment.  That is an important provision because many people cannot afford to buy a house at present and that provision would help in that regard.  If the Minister has not made provision for that measure, I hope he will accept the amendment we will table.  I am grateful to have had this opportunity to contribute to the debate and I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Bradford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan in full flight was always quite a fearsome political animal.  I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill.  It is the first occasion on which the debate on the Finance Bill has taken place some months after the announcement of the budget. Prior to this the budget was introduced in January, the debate on it ran into late February and sometimes up to early March and the Finance Bill was very much a rehash of what was debated a week or a month previously.  However, on this <Col N="670" /> occasion we have had some time to pause and that gives people a better opportunity to reflect more fully and in a more detailed fashion on the Government's economic and social policy.  The Finance Bill outlines the Government's fiscal policy for the year and gives us the political opportunity to reflect on what the Government is proposing for the economy and what type of society it is trying to build.  There are many welcome aspects about this Finance Bill as there are about any Finance Bill, but it is our role in Opposition to question the provisions included in it, to highlight those that are not included in it and to use this occasion to put forward alternative proposals which we consider necessary.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to comment on the position regarding the credit unions.  I know that most previous speakers have spoken at length on the matter and I do not have anything particularly new to add to that.  It was a major debating point last week and, regardless of what solution or interim settlement the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, reached yesterday with the credit union movement, we cannot ignore the fact that he produced certain proposals last week which appeared to be extremely detrimental not only to the credit union movement but to the wider social consensus.  It presented a view of Government which showed Government policy to be skewed against those people on the lower end of the scale which is unhelpful when we are trying to maintain social partnership.  Social partnership has worked very well over the past ten years or so and has played a major role in developing our so called Celtic tiger.  The budget did not help in this regard, but there are signs that social partnership is beginning to be questioned by people in the trade union movement and it will be bad for the economy if social partnership breaks down.</P>
      <P>Any signals or policy changes put in place by Government which hinder social partnership must be opposed and what was proposed in relation to the credit union movement was a big negative in that regard.  I welcome the climbdown by the Minister.  A solution was not reached yesterday, rather a decision was taken to remove what was proposed last week.  The Minister will enter into further discussion with the League of Credit Unions and I will be interested to see what will come out of the melting pot.  That will be important not only from the point of view of the credit union movement but from a wider social perspective because it is necessary to reach a positive and reasonable solution with the credit union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major mistake was made last week and the Minister must learn from it.  He indicated on a television programme last night that he had learned from his mistake, but the public also learned something.  They learned that perhaps the Government is not looking as carefully and as sympathetically on people on the lower income scale as on those in other sectors of our society. <Col N="671" /> We must be careful about any wrong signals we send in that regard.</P>
    <P>We all welcome tax reductions and everybody hopes to pay less taxes.  The Minister had a choice in the budget last December and the decisions he took are now being put into effect.  I wonder, however, what the long-term effects of the Government's decisions will be.  Significant moneys were available for tax reductions, yet political and economic decisions were taken to favour the better off.  The Minister quoted certain figures to present a case whereby people on higher incomes would end up paying more taxes, but the less well off did not benefit from the budget to the extent that they could or should have done.</P>
    <P>A front page editorial in a daily newspaper on polling day last year said it was payback time, but whose payback does this Finance Bill represent? It is not a payback for all the people on lower income levels who have contributed enormously towards creating the Celtic tiger; neither is it a big payback for people on unemployment assistance or benefit.  It is not a big payback for those on a gross income of £8,000 to £20,000.  It is payback time, however, for people with gross salaries of £30,000 to £60,000.  It is a payback for big business which will gain significantly from the reduction in capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>A Government comprising a combination of parties is politically entitled to do what it wishes with the resources available but the resources in the budget and the Finance Bill could have been put to more constructive social use.  The fact that we are giving the greatest share of what is available to those who have most is not good economics or social politics and I fear its long-term effects on the social consensus.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government appears to be ideologically driven by people within the Progressive Democrats Party and the right wing of the Fianna Fáil Party. They are entitled to adopt such a political approach, but it is one which had negative connotations in the United Kingdom in recent years. We should have looked twice before taking the route along which the budget and the Finance Bill are taking us.  I seriously wonder whether it will work.</P>
    <P>There was no great public outcry to extend opening hours for betting offices.  The proposal has not been welcomed by betting office staff who will have to work unsocial hours late into the evenings, including Sundays.  It will not be of tremendous benefit to the racing industry or employment associated with it.  The proposal is not a good one and I hope the Minister will reexamine it.  I am not sure of the concept or ethos behind the Minister's proposal.  While he is a well known racing and betting man, on this occasion he may have got it wrong.  I hope he will reconsider the proposal.</P>
    <P>In last week's <i>Irish Field</i> I read that the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association had made a <Col N="672" /> submission to the Minister for Finance in relation to certain amendments it wished to see to the Finance Bill.  These amendments, which would be worthwhile from the point of view of the horse breeding industry, are not included in the Finance Bill.  When the Minister replies to the debate, will he indicate whether he has considered these proposals? Will he consider an amendment to introduce them on Committee Stage?  Unlike the proposals for the betting industry, these would benefit the horse breeding industry and would ensure that more people would be employed in it. It would also ensure the thoroughbred breeding industry retains its important position in the European bloodstock industry.</P>

      <P>If we were to use a popular cliché, we could say the budget and the Finance Bill will make the Celtic tiger purr.  It is important for everybody, including Opposition spokespersons, to see this as the first component of a four year process.  We must judge the budget and the Finance Bill against the appalling failure of the rainbow Government to reduce the standard and top rates of income tax over three years.  It was an appalling record and it was essential to grant relief to working families.</P>
      <P>Both inside and outside this House I have spoken of my personal experience, with a large family, of working in a semi-State company and paying 60 per cent of my income in stoppages. There was no other earner in the household.  It was almost criminal and it had to change.  I consider myself one of the ordinary people, to whom Deputy Rabbitte and others referred.</P>
      <P>The combination of income tax reductions with the welcome changes in corporation tax and capital gains tax, will maintain strong economic growth in the years ahead.  We must plan ahead and I am anxious to see the process of reducing rates and taxes in general continue until our tax rates can truly be regarded as pro family and pro work.</P>
      <P>Small and medium sized enterprises, which everyone agrees are the lifeblood of a thriving economy, will be particularly encouraged by the process of a phased reduction in corporation tax. This is further evidence of the Government's pro-enterprise approach.  In this context, the reduction in capital gains tax is also welcome and should prove to be self-financing.  This is because many assets which appreciated in value in recent years were not sold due to the high rate of capital gains tax that prevailed up to now.  The Minister has introduced specific conditions in hard hitting areas and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy for a constituency with a considerable variation in economic conditions, I am acutely aware that changes in capital gains tax and <Col N="673" /> corporation tax are much removed from the lives of many people, yet they represent an important area of the economy.  I am glad the budget emphasised the need for measures to boost social inclusion.  Over £200 million has been set aside for this purpose and I know it will be money well spent.  Many people involved in community activities are aware of the projects that are supported by this money.  They represent an important aspect of the life of the general community.</P>
    <P>All social welfare increases have been above the rate of inflation and the £5 weekly increase in the basic State pension will be of particular benefit. This contrasts sharply with the shameful record of the previous Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to maintain the personal exemption limit for capital gains tax at £1,000 per person, which will assist small investors. I would prefer if the ability of persons to use their spouses' unused allowance was maintained. We must encourage small investors.  We keep paying lip service to them, saying how important small businesses are, but when anything is done to help them the usual left wing rhetoric is trotted out.  This a positive budget overall which is financially prudent, which promotes social inclusion, which rewards work and initiative and keeps the country on course for EMU.</P>
    <P>EMU is the single most important issue facing the country and one of the most important decisions we have ever had to make.  It is an unparalleled event in our history.  It is incredible, therefore, that there has been no contribution on it other than the broken record on the rate of entry.  The Opposition spokespersons on finance have ignored the issue of EMU with that one exception.  In defence of the Minister for Finance, he has been totally consistent in his approach, both in Opposition and as Minister.  He said in Opposition that any Minister for Finance should adopt the buttoned lip approach to this issue.  He has repeatedly said his only interest is getting the best possible benefit for the country and that there are so many variables he will make no announcement until the middle of May when the decision must be made.  It is amazing and seems to be no more than morbid curiosity at this stage, especially for Deputy Noonan, to demand that this should be announced before that date.  So many variables exist and there are so many matters over which we have no control, it is incredible he keeps asking for the rate to be announced. He should concentrate on other issues related to EMU, such as the liberalisation of services, such as the postal and transport services, for example. These are important items which should be raised in this House but are being ignored.</P>
    <P>It indicates a lot about the Opposition, both Democratic Left and Fine Gael, that most of their contributions concerned one item only &mdash; the changes proposed for the credit unions.  I found Deputy Noonan's personal approach in his reply to the Minister regrettable.  I could not understand why he was not worried about Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds, for example.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> However, like Deputy Deenihan, I also watched &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night on which all was revealed.  Deputy Noonan was not concerned about the future of this country or EMU, but about a vacant seat in Limerick East.</P>
    <P>If the rest of his contribution on finance is as accurate as his description last week of Fianna Fáil canvassers in Limerick, he is very much wanting.  He stated every canvasser was asked at every door about the issue of credit unions.  I had the privilege of canvassing all day Saturday.  I covered 268 houses in Limerick East and the issue was raised three times.  I made one phone call at 7.30 p.m. after finishing because there was a private query in one of the houses.</P>
    <P>One matter consistently raised on the doorsteps was the excellent candidate, Sandra Marsh. Admittedly I was canvassing in the area where her mother was born, but we covered many other areas across Limerick, and it was the one consistent issue.  Her excellent qualities, how she could articulate people's cases, how she had made the breakthrough in the normally male dominated sphere of the GAA, were all raised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte seemed to complain that correspondence was released and available on the credit union issue.  The matter must be clarified quickly.  In the co-op movement, there have been situations where the leadership lost touch with the subscribers and contributors to the co-op.  In this case, an approach was made by the executive of the Irish League of Credit Unions last November and a letter was issued by it in December asking the Minister to do three specific things. The Minister put it on record last night that he informed the league before the November meeting he had no intention of referring to credit unions in the Finance Bill, yet they were mentioned. I learned from people I work with in my area that three or four credit unions have reached a stage where they are out of touch with the rest because they are so big.  By coincidence, they all seem to be involved in the State, semi-State or commercial areas; they are not ordinary community credit unions.  If they have a problem with income tax, they should be open about it.  I suggest the board of every credit union be asked if an approach was made, if they were aware of the approach, what it involved and who would have benefited from it.  The issue must be put to bed. In the meantime, we will continue to work in Limerick East on the basis of our record and for the future of this country.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have improved the financial situation of hundreds of thousands of people.  They certainly improved it in the case of thousands of people who were in debt to moneylenders and others.  Deputy Woods, who was then the relevant Minister, initiated the measure whereby credit unions would go guarantor for people in difficulties and would negotiate with moneylenders and others.  We fully supported that.</P>
    <P>Other issues which probably should be discussed are methods of tax relief.  They can take three forms: tax rates, tax bands or tax shelters. <Col N="675" /> The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has taken steps to close down the last one.  Of all the complaints I have heard over the years, most have been about tax shelters for the well off.  He has taken steps to close them down.  The change in corporation tax was justified by the Minister when he pointed out it was about continuing to prime the economic pump.  However, tax shelters are a different issue and he has dealt with them speedily, unlike the Government of the past three and a half years.  I was not in the Dáil between 1992 and 1997, but I know Fianna Fáil was not in Government all that time, so why was action not taken on the prisons and other problems?  I find it hard to understand the new lease of life these matters have gained in the past weeks and in the approach to the two by-elections.</P>
    <P>I deeply resented having to pay high tax rates as an ordinary working man with seven children. There were nine to feed, yet I had to pay that kind of tax.  I had to work overtime to pay my way.  I do not mind referring to my personal circumstances. The rates had to change and we can look back at Fianna Fáil's record in that regard. The first tax rate reduction was made by a Fianna Fáil Government.  We are continuing that trend and I encourage it.  The tax bands must change, but they must be linked to a four year programme of cutting rates.  Tax rates were penal, everyone admitted it, but people still wanted to play games with the issue in this House.  The rates and the bands must be re-examined and I am sure that will be the next step.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's promise of an urban renewal scheme.  There has been criticism of this. Before he announced it, there was criticism it was not included.  Now there is criticism the final details are not included.  I welcome the time extension for other schemes as they will be of assistance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Deenihan and others that there is a need to assist the first-time buyer of a house.  We must deal with problems as they arise, and if a change in policy is needed, so be it, but it should be done quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be lauded for his efforts at reconciling the times for tax returns and finance matters in general.  Those of us not involved in the financial area but involved with voluntary groups and such like, with responsibility for making returns and ensuring the group's financial affairs are in order, found it crazy that there were three or four operative dates.  I laud the Minister for coming to grips with that.  As a former Minister for Finance, he is aware of the problems that can arise.  The question of taxpayers moving on to the higher rate of tax too quickly has been raised. Obviously the rates need to be cut, but some contributors have totally disregarded the fact that the rates have been cut.  The amount of money benefiting taxpayers in this regard is huge.</P>
    <P>On the question of the entry rate for EMU, I am worried that the pressure being applied, by Deputy Noonan in particular, might damage financial <Col N="676" /> structures.  Will he accept what is being said on a whole range of issues, from the value of sterling to what the Bundesbank will do?  In the interests of our economy we should wait until the last possible moment to debate the best possible entry rate.  Speculators are already waiting to take us apart if they can, and they have the money to do it.  In the interests of the country, people should support the Minister's approach.</P>
    <P>The question of measures to root out the black economy and tax evasion was also raised.  Tax evasion and the black economy are illegal. However, on the legal side, tax shelters had to be tackled so that everybody would get a fair crack of the whip.  Last night Deputy McDowell said that they &mdash; I presume he meant the Labour Party &mdash; do not now use the language of class envy.  That is an amazing statement, given their reaction to the budget.  They have tried to stir up class envy.  When somebody sets up a business and does well, there is a degree of envy in the approach of some of the people who contributed to this debate.  That is a pity because the opportunity afforded by this debate could have been better used.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned that Fianna Fáil was the party of the plain people of Ireland.  That is great praise coming from that direction, even if it was a backhanded compliment and an attempt to be cynical.  However, we welcome the compliment, because we recognise ourselves as the party of the plain people of Ireland.  He praised Deputy Healy-Rae whom he ridiculed four or five years ago when he was a Fianna Fáil activist.  We can do without that kind of thing here.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill is excellent, following on a very good budget.  It is financially prudent, promotes social inclusion, rewards work and initiative on all sides, and keeps the country on course for economic and monetary union.  I am delighted to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatCarey" hpid="Mr. P. Carey Mr. P. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to the revisiting of the credit union issue as the greatest political U-turn he can recall.  I wonder what he thinks of the IAVI statement issued this morning dealing with the Fine Gael proposals on stamp duty.  I would regard it as equivalent to a political somersault.  I hope any amendments the Deputy proposes are consistent with Fine Gael's policy in Government which was to consistently increase the level of stamp duty.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill is a measured approach to the country's affairs.  It is significant that the first few sections include measures promoting social inclusion.  I greatly welcome the provisions to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to work.  There is no doubt that there are pockets of high unemployment, and we need measures like those in the Finance Bill to encourage people to enter into mainstream employment.  I am glad that, as a mechanism to get people to return to work, certain courses and certain work are not now regarded as inhibitions to eligibility to unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> I welcome section 13 whereby certain schools designated as disadvantaged by the Minister for Education and Science will be able to attract funding which will be eligible for tax relief.  I have long argued that the capacity of schools in disadvantaged areas to raise their own finance has been a seriously inhibiting factor in alleviating high levels of disadvantage.  Some schools are not able to get their own computers or take on additional teachers for subjects like music, sport etc.  This provision will assist that type of initiative. I mentioned at the Committee on Education and Science and in my contribution on Second Stage of the Education (No. 2) Bill that in deciding on criteria for designating a school as disadvantaged, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education and Science should consider the situation of parents who live in disadvantaged areas and send their children to a school just outside that disadvantaged area which does not qualify for resource and remedial teachers, home school liaison officers or increased capitation grants.  There is pressure to look again at the criteria used to measure levels of disadvantage and how schools on the periphery of disadvantaged areas can qualify for tax relief so that the playing pitch can be levelled in the context of fundraising.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look at section 19 in relation to tax relief for enterprise areas in the Cherry Orchard-Gallanstown, Finglas and Rosslare Harbour areas.  I do not pretend to be an expert on these matters, but I see that the date for qualification for tax relief is being changed from 30 June 2000 to 31 December 1999.  Will the Minister revisit that provision, because the Ballymun area is in the course of rejuvenation at the moment, and the Finglas Technology Campus, which is located in Ballymun, is preparing a master plan involving the construction of 2,800 houses and the development of industrial sites and other facilities and, with the best will in the world, it will be very difficult for them to conclude that master plan in time to qualify for the new deadline?  The same will apply in the Cherry Orchard-Gallanstown area.</P>
    <P>There is a further provision in section 36, in relation to other approved third level education institutions qualifying for capital allowances.  That obviously applies to some of the private colleges. At a time when there is increased participation in third level education &mdash; this is being encouraged through various mechanisms &mdash; it is correct that private third level colleges should be included in the scheme of tax relief for capital allowances.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the new area of further education.  While this is a burgeoning sector of education, it is neither second nor third level education and is not properly regulated.  A substantial number of students are pursuing further education courses which will ultimately be certified by Teastas or the NCEA.  I am aware of approximately six colleges in the Dublin area and I have no doubt there are many such colleges in other areas dedicated to further education. However, many of them need new equipment and <Col N="678" /> upgrading.  This matter must be taken on board by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford referred to a matter which is also of concern to me, the opening hours of betting shops.  I have only ever attended one race meeting and have never been inside a betting shop so I cannot claim to be an expert on this matter.  However, workers in these shops have raised with me their concerns about extended opening hours.  Many of these workers are women, while many of the shops are located in areas where income levels are not very high.  By extending the opening hours of betting shops we may be providing a further temptation for people to spend their limited incomes.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 73 which deals with the taxation of alcoholic lemonades.  While restrictions were recently placed on this scourge, the introduction of any measure which makes it less attractive from a financial point of view the better. I also welcome section 81 which deals with the sale of unstamped tobacco products.  Up to six or eight months ago one would see people selling smuggled cigarettes on Mary Street and Henry Street.  I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda for the vigorous way they have enforced the regulations governing this matter.  The sale of these products on the streets has decreased significantly in recent months.</P>
    <P>Section 69 deals with the licensing of gaming machines.  People in Dublin and other areas fought a long battle to have gaming machines prohibited.  We should tread warily when dealing with this issue so that we do not provide further opportunities for people to engage in legal or illegal gambling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Boylan.  Deputy Carey is a man after my own heart in terms of many of the issues to which he referred.  For example, I agree with his points about betting shops.  Some people are addicted to betting and they will now be able to stay in betting shops until 10 p.m. squandering money they can ill afford.</P>
      <P>In this context, it is time the Government dealt with the issue of Sunday trading, a practice I have opposed in Government and Opposition.  There is no longer any difference between Sunday and a weekday.  Sunday should be a day of rest when people spend time with their families, go to a football match or relax.  I am not talking about the small corner shop which has always opened on a Sunday.  In most cases these shops survived on the money they made on a Sunday.  However, they have now lost this business to Tesco and other major supermarkets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, met representatives of Tesco to discuss the ban on the sale of Irish beef in its supermarkets in Britain.  This supermarket chain took over an Irish business worth approximately £700 million, yet it has erected signs in its supermarkets in Britain telling customers that it <Col N="679" /> does not sell cheap Irish beef.  Our beef is the best in the world and this action is an effort to pacify British farmers.  This is wrong and I am glad the Minister and his Minister of State have taken up the issue.  If this action continues then we may have to make certain calls, which I will not be afraid to make.  If Tesco wants to continue to trade in Ireland it must remember that it is operating in the EU Single Market and cannot continue to take action which affects Irish farmers. We are not responsible for what is happening in the British economy and cannot be blamed for the strength of sterling or the weakness of the punt.  When the boot was on the other foot Irish farmers had to put up with the situation.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with a Minister making a U-turn on a daft, ridiculous and stupid proposal. He knows he made a mistake and I am glad he has corrected it.  The credit union, particularly in rural areas, was the working man's bank and gave many people assistance at a time when the bank would not.  Successive Governments advised people to join credit unions rather than borrow money from moneylenders.  Deputy Dennehy said he called to 200 houses over the weekend. At my clinic in north Mayo on Saturday many people blamed not only the Government but also the Opposition for the proposal in relation to credit unions.</P>
    <P>The Government is worried about the by-elections.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are worries about a general election which might not be far off, but we will fight it when the times comes.  I agree with the comments made on Sunday trading and betting shops.</P>
      <P>Both in and out of Government I have raised the difficulties faced by young couples buying their first house.  Tax breaks are for the rich.  They do not help those on average and low incomes and have pushed the price of houses beyond the reach of ordinary people.  While there is nothing wrong with tax breaks designed to attract industry and improve tourism facilities future Governments should not be allowed to introduce tax breaks for housing.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has established a committee to examine this problem.  It should report immediately to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people who own property in Westport, Ballina and north Mayo are not from the area. Few local people own property because they cannot afford it.  Some people have five and six houses while a young couple cannot buy a house in my town and must move further from the town to buy a cheaper house.  I am glad Fine Gael is proposing that first time buyers should be exempt from stamp duty on secondhand houses.  It is wrong that people have to pay stamp duty on a <Col N="680" /> first house.  I hope the Government will do something about this crisis in the housing market.</P>
    <P>For a single person earning £15,000 or a husband and wife on £30,000, the first time buyers grant should be increased to £7,000 or £8,000.  Tax breaks are there for the rich but there is nothing for the middle class or the poor.  This was why people responded so bitterly to the announcement on credit unions.  It was seen as another attack on the middle class and the poor.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago a scheme was introduced to allow people buy local authority houses for £9,000 or £10,000 and many people availed of it. However some of these houses now need new doors and windows.  People are repaying loans and so they cannot afford to carry out renovations. There is no grant available for them. Three grants are available, one for disabled persons, one as special aid for the elderly and another for essential repairs for people over 60, but there is no grant for young couples whose houses need new doors, windows or roofs.</P>
    <P>The last grant scheme was faulty because it was available to everyone, including the rich.  Doctors and solicitors used State grants to repair roofs. This scheme should be reintroduced as a means tested scheme so that a single person earning more than £17,000 or a couple earning more than £25,000 would not qualify.  What I suggested must be done to help people to keep existing homes and buy new homes.  Tax designation has destroyed the housing market.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State Deputy Moffatt would assist me on the tax designation for Knock airport.  I was disappointed by Deputy Harney's comments yesterday on jobs for the west of Ireland.  There was not much commitment from any Government on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher" hpid="Mr. Kelleher Mr. Kelleher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should ask Deputy Kenny about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>At least he introduced the Act which includes reference to qualifying trading conditions. Activities such as cargo handling, distribution and other related airport activities should be included in the tax designation.  If we attract freight and service companies to our airports they will bring the industry needed in rural Ireland. This will assist Knock, Shannon and Cork. Deputy Moffatt is Minister of State with responsibility for the west and is committed to the region. He should raise this matter with his colleagues and the Department of Finance so that an amendment to the Finance Bill is tabled.  I hope Fine Gael will table that amendment and that it will be supported by the Government.  It will assist the board of Knock Airport to attract industry to the west.  It looks like Deputy Harney has thrown in the towel so we will have to table such an amendment. I know Deputy Moffatt and the Government will support me on this matter.  The Government always emphasises its commitment to the west.  We are not asking for much.  This would be a small amendment.  The scheme will only run <Col N="681" /> until 1999.  We need this amendment to entice industry to the west.  Deputy Harney is correct that it is difficult to attract companies to the region.  However, there are major companies such as Allergan in Westport, Baxter in Castlebar and Hollister in Ballina.  Allergan's European headquarters in Westport employs more than 1,000 people.  We have proven that people in the west can do as good a job as those in Galway, Dublin or Cork.</P>
      <P>There have been many job announcements over the past three or four years and I cannot see why jobs could not have been brought to the west.  We are capable of providing the employees. Many people from the west who work all over Ireland and beyond would be delighted to return home to raise their families.  Ever since entering politics I have been approached by civil servants from the west working in Departments in Dublin who would love to return to the west to live and raise their children.  They have been forced to live in Dublin which suffers from traffic problems and overstretched services.  I do not understand why some Government agencies and jobs are not brought to the west where there is a major problem with emigration and people leaving the land.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, knows, there were nine parliamentary seats in Mayo where now there are only five.  This speaks for itself and is an indictment of all Governments and their neglect of the west.  Nobody is doing anything about it. The people are becoming mobilised and will be putting pressure on political parties, something I welcome.  They are saying enough is enough and I welcome their support.  I know the Minister is committed to this issue and I ask him to talk to the Minister for Finance regarding Knock airport and the small changes we are recommending to the Finance Bill which will assist the board of the airport, and the west in general, to bring in freight companies and service industries which will facilitate other major industries in the Knock area.  I do not think the Minister for Finance should refuse to make these changes and I am pleading with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, whom I know will support me, to do something about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moffatt has a special responsibility for the elderly and I wish to raise two projects which I have been promoting for many years, namely, the need for an old folks home for Achill and Ballinrobe.  I know the Minister will not let me down and that both projects are close to his heart. As a doctor he will understand what I am saying. Achill is now on line &mdash; there is no problem &mdash; but I am putting pressure on him to deliver in Ballinrobe, as I know he will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week I read in the local paper that Deputy Cooper-Flynn congratulated the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs in relation to the money saved by that Department.  I too congratulate the Minister in his action against people who defraud the State.  I would never support <Col N="682" /> such fraud.  I raised this issue when Fine Gael was in Government and I brought the Minister to the west when attacks were being made on rural Ireland.  I could never support those who defraud the social welfare system or the State in any manner. The fraud is of taxpayers' money and taking £1 from A results in £1 being taken from B.</P>
    <P>When the announcement was made by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regarding anti-fraud measures, I made the point that those singled out would be small farmers and those in the west.  I was right.  I was at clinics in Belmullet on Saturday and met many people, half of whom were small farmers.  One man with six children and 13 or 14 acres of land told me that the Department took £10 off his social welfare allowance.  Another person with 2.3 acres was deducted a few pounds because he had cattle.  This is a disgrace and I call on the Minister to take on those who defraud the system, namely, those who are working and drawing social welfare at the same time.  However, it is wrong to be attacking small farmers and small people with two or three children.  The first man I mentioned had one child attending the Regional Technical College in Letterkenny and another attending the Regional Technical College in Galway.  He had to collect them in Ballina and it was costing him £28 per week.  Despite this his social welfare income was reduced.</P>

      <P>I have been elected to the Dáil and will say what I must on behalf of the people I represent.  That is what I am elected for.  I listened to people who were hurt, upset and distraught crying in my clinic on Saturday because the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs was attacking them.  These people read about Deputy Cooper-Flynn's stance now that Fianna Fáil is in Government which differs from her tune when the party was in Opposition.  I have had the same tune when our party was in Government as when in Opposition.  I do not like to see attacks being made on people receiving social welfare.  It is not right that the number of chickens, geese, turkeys which people have on their land are counted.  Whatever people have on their land it is very little.  It is not possible to rear a pig on the land in north Mayo.</P>
      <P>I came across another case in north Mayo of somebody receiving a small pension from England and the balance from Ireland.  Last week I was told the Department calculated the English pension in punts.  The recipient said the Department did not assist her when the punt was strong and social welfare was weak.  This is double standards and I do not think the Department should take money off people when sterling is strong while doing nothing for them when sterling is weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless widows and widowers are eligible in their own right, they do not benefit from free <Col N="683" /> schemes, including ESB and fuel allowances, when a spouse dies.  They should continue to benefit for at least six months to allow a period of readjustment.</P>
    <P>People who finish FÁS courses retain their stamps but lose their free schemes including their bonus at Christmas.  This is another attack on ordinary people and I am asking that the situation be addressed.</P>
    <P>The question of Knock airport is a serious one on which we all agree.  This is not about politics but about the survival of the west and helping to bring industry to Mayo and the west, something successive Governments have failed to do.  I ask the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children to meet the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, with a view to introducing the necessary amendment to include freight, cargo and the other necessary services.  I and my colleagues will support such a move.</P>
    <P>People on low incomes are disillusioned by successive Governments which, they feel, are there for the rich and to reduce the status of those on middle incomes.  In particular there is a feeling that those on social welfare are being attacked from all sides.</P>
    <P>Housing is a serious problem and I was disappointed at the allocation of council houses, particularly in Mayo, by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy.  The allocation was down five on last year and 20 on the previous year.  People are now returning from England and elsewhere to live in rural Ireland and we are encouraging them to do so.  However, they have nowhere to live.  Husbands, wives and children will not be able to stay if there is nothing for them.  I call on the Minister and the Government to provide a decent allocation for housing in rural areas.  There is a major problem.  Many people would buy their own house but for the tax designations. I listened to the representative of the Irish Permanent shed crocodile tears, saying he was sorry that the Government had not dealt with this problem.  However, such institutions, including the banks and the financial institutions, are the cause of the problem as they are giving funds to those who already have plenty while those on middle incomes have to fight hard to get a loan for a house.  Those with money are getting funds to buy a second, third and fourth house.  All these people care about is profit.  The Irish Permanent made £55 million this year.  The Government should assist local authorities by means of grants to buy land which can then be sold cheaply as sites to young couples.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moffatt, will assist me on the matters relating to Knock airport and that he will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  Do not mind the civil servants &mdash; they have all the answers.  However, they do not stand before the people.  We represent the people and I want to <Col N="684" /> see provision for the airport included in amendments to the Bill next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing time with me.  Where would we be without Knock airport?</P>
      <P>In framing the budget the Government inherited a booming economy.  The Government is enjoying good times which are the result of the prudent management over two and a half years which turned the economy around.  Investment from abroad came in at an unexpected rate. Under previous Administrations investors were dubious about coming here, but that position changed when confidence was restored in the Government.</P>
      <P>Since this budget was framed in good times it was expected that the wealth of the nation would be spread across all sectors of the economy, but that did not happen.  At one end of the spectrum capital gains tax was slashed while at the other end there was an attack on credit unions.  The rich will get richer and people on low income will remain in that position.  That is unfair and unacceptable.  One would expect a Government which includes the Fianna Fáil Party, which receives much support from the lower to middle income group, to give those people a fair deal, but it did not do so.</P>
      <P>There was an opportunity in the budget to improve the position of lower income people on PAYE, but the improvements are minimal and will not be noticed on 1 April.  At the same time there are massive benefits for people on higher income.  That will create disillusionment and anger and will force young people starting work, people at the lower end of the income scale, to vote for parties which they believe will serve their purpose better.  That is not good for democracy. For that reason I am disappointed with the budget.</P>
      <P>In regard to credit unions &mdash; I welcome the about-turn on this occasion &mdash; the Minister, Deputy McCreevy has been magnanimous in accepting responsibility for the decision to introduce this tax, but that was a Government decision, into which each member of the Government had an input.  I admire the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, for taking the criticism and realising that a major blunder was made by the Government. Given that the Government makes such mistakes in good times, I am fearful of what will happen when pressure is put to bear, because good times do not last forever.  When times are good we should ensure we look after as many people as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit unions play a major role in terms of small investors and people wishing to take out small borrowings, and for that reason they must be supported.  I am aware from involvement with credit unions in my county of Cavan &mdash; one of the finest credit unions is situated in Ballyconnell and the Telecom credit union is led by a Cavan man, Michael Reilly from Redhills &mdash; that when the Credit Union Bill was discussed in the Dáil, <Col N="685" /> banking institutions put pressure on the then Government not to grant certain facilities to credit unions, but the Government resisted that pressure.  It was a shock, therefore, to hear that credit unions were to be brought into the realm of taxation.  Much voluntary work is done by people under the umbrella of the credit union.  Their role is to advise low income families, encourage them to make savings and be prudent in taking out borrowings, and I salute them for that.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, assistance could have been given to young people seeking to purchase houses.  In other European countries it is acceptable to rent accommodation, but house ownership is traditional in this country.  People should be encouraged to buy houses, but given that the average family home costs more than £80,000, it is almost impossible for young people starting out in life to buy a house.  There is concern that lending institutions dole out money liberally to young couples without doing their sums and finding out whether income will sustain borrowings.  The Government must assist people in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I salute my party on the abolition of stamp duty for first time purchasers of secondhand houses. That was a step in the right direction which will help young couples in purchasing houses.  The £3,000 grant for first time house purchasers is totally unrealistic.  It should be increased to a minimum of £10,000 and should be income related. Rather than provide the grant across the board, including people earning £50,000 or more, it should be made available only to low income families.  A grant of £10,000 would help relieve some of the burden placed on those people.</P>
    <P>As a result of slashing capital gains tax, business people are purchasing property with a view to selling it in two or three years at an enormous profit.  Only people who have the money or the wherewithal to get borrowings from lending institutions can make such investments.  That matter should be considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to urban renewal, there is no incentive to develop small towns and villages in the Border region and the west.  Under the Bill urban renewal is available only to towns with a population in excess of 6,000.  Those towns benefit from the upsurge in the economy and are succeeding, but smaller towns need assistance.  Not one town in County Cavan qualifies for urban renewal status.  If the Minister does not agree to change the population provision, perhaps he will consider grouping towns together &mdash; for example, Virginia and Ballyjamesduff or Bailieborough and Cootehill which, when grouped together, would have a population of at least 6,000.  Those towns could work together in making improvements. The urban renewal scheme is of great benefit, but it is particularly needed in towns with smaller populations.</P>

      <P>I represent the constituency of Cork North-West and I will deal with the Finance Bill in light of the benefits to that area.  Like the constituency represented by Deputy Ring, Cork North-West is a rural constituency, with a population in the largest town of about 3,000. These areas appear to be under threat and in decline under successive Governments.  Unless rural areas receive priority treatment, their populations will die out.</P>
      <P>My constituents reacted angrily to the credit union taxation proposals as they feared further legislation in this area would eventually mean that all credit unions interests and dividends would be taxed.  Nora Herlihy, the founder of the credit union movement, came from Ballydesmond, a small village in Cork North-West, which is only a mile and a half away from my own home. Accordingly, people in my constituency are very proud of the credit union movement and all it represents.  It is imperative that we protect the small saver, be it a child saving his or her communion or confirmation money or a young adult saving to buy his or her first car.  We must create an environment where everybody can prosper and grow and where the good things in life can be afforded by all, not just those at the top of the income scale.</P>
      <P>One of the proposals put forward in the recent budget, and due to be introduced in the Finance Bill on Committee Stage, related to a pilot programme for the upper Shannon region.  That is a very welcome development and we await the details of the programme with interest.  I have no doubt that all areas in rural Ireland will seek the extension of this pilot scheme as it is one which could encourage investment in rural communities. For far too long, we have seen large urban areas benefiting from the effects of the Celtic tiger economy.  The Celtic tiger certainly has not come to rural Ireland although its effects can be seen in the construction industry there.</P>
      <P>Family farms are under severe threat.  People on viable holdings are retiring from farming but their children are not taking them over as they do not see life in rural communities as an option due to the lack of available services.  Last Sunday, a community development meeting was held in my home village of Kiskeam.  Many young people who had just finished college and some who were in their first jobs attended the meeting.  They were asked what would be required to encourage them to return to live in a rural community such as Kiskeam instead of living and working in Cork or Dublin.  They said there was nothing in rural communities for them apart from the GAA. Were it not for the GAA, rural communities would have no source of entertainment or diversity at all.  Rural communities must be positively discriminated against if young people are to be attracted back to rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report was published in recent months which suggested that school transport charges should be introduced.  Such a measure would constitute a further attack on rural communities and must be <Col N="687" /> fought by all parties to ensure free school transport continues to be provided.</P>
    <P>To keep rural areas alive, we must retain and further develop facilities therein to accommodate a wider spectrum of the community.  Following the visit of a delegation from Mallow hospital to the Minister for Health and Children last year, the Department has seen fit to visit the hospital and possibly upgrade it.  This is a small acute general hospital located 20 miles from Cork city and just outside my constituency.  Instead of people having to drive 40 or 50 miles to the city, they can avail of facilities in Mallow hospital.  Small hospitals such as this must be kept open.  We are also lucky in having very good district hospitals in my local area.  I congratulate the health board and the Minister for agreeing to provide an extension in Kanturk hospital for day-care and psychiatric patients, in addition to long-term patients.</P>
    <P>We must encourage young people to set up home in rural Ireland by increasing the first time buyers' grant or by encouraging people to renovate derelict houses or cottages.  Appropriate measures to achieve this must be included in the White Paper being prepared by the Minister of State with responsibility for rural development, Deputy Davern.  If young people are encouraged to locate in rural communities, they will live near their parents and it is probable that less strain would be placed on the financial resources of the State if their parents did not have to be institutionalised when they became elderly.</P>
    <P>Those of us who come from rural communities will be aware that the social mix of young, middle aged and old people in one community creates a great deal of respect between the age groups.  In urban Ireland, new housing estates are being populated solely by young people.  Rural Ireland can boast a greater integration of age groups which creates many benefits.</P>
    <P>We must encourage the location of more industry in rural communities.  The argument we have been given in my constituency is that we are too isolated and too far removed from regional airports or ports for industry to locate there.  Given the traffic levels which prevail in Dublin, a lorry carrying goods on a ten or 15 mile journey may take up to an hour and a half to reach its destination. One could cover 50 or 60 miles in a rural area in that time.  A company located on the western side of our constituency employs almost 1,000 people, supplies windows and doors throughout the country and is now exporting to the UK. People leave Duhallow every morning to travel to Galway, Mayo and the midlands.  Produce is being transported from the factory at night and is being exported through Belfast Harbour or Dublin Port.  The company is an indigenous one but we must ensure that rural Ireland is not discriminated against in the location of new industry.  If work is not available in rural areas, people will naturally gravitate to areas where employment is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I had a meeting with President Santer in Brussels on 18 December last.  We had a full discussion of the issues on the current European agenda.  We focused in particular on the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals and their implications for Ireland.  The necessity for further meetings or contacts with the Commission President is kept under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach's attention been drawn to the statement made by Commissioner Flynn last week?  He said Irish GNP as a percentage of the average <i>per capita</i> GNP of the Union is now 103 per cent or approximately 90 per cent based on GDP.  In view of the fact that the gross national product of the 11 applicant states equates to the GNP of one medium sized state, the Netherlands, and the challenges which that presents for future enlargement, did the Taoiseach seek an undertaking from the Commission President that Ireland would continue to receive transfers beyond 1999 and that they would not end suddenly?  Will the Taoiseach be able to give such an assurance to the electorate during the ratification procedure for the Amsterdam Treaty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the European Commission's figures.  They have been quoted by a number of commissioners during recent meetings. The Government's objective in the negotiations on Structural Funds, which will commence in a few months, is to secure continued access for the country to Objective I status and to ensure there are satisfactory transitional funding arrangements.  Our argument is that they should apply over the next full funding period from the end of 1999 to 2006.  These issues will have to be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission's policy since 1989 has been that a country should try to achieve the average GNP of the Union and then sustain it.  A quick cut-off point would jeopardise the ability of a <Col N="689" /> country to sustain it.  While Ireland has done remarkably well over the Structural and Cohesion Funds period, it needs an adequate phasing out period.  I hope that argument, which is Ireland's negotiating position, will be agreed to by the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach.  The first relates to the point raised by Deputy Mitchell.  Did the Taoiseach explicitly raise with President Santer the unique difference in the Irish context between GNP and gross domestic product?  The difference between gross domestic product and gross national product in every other country is marginal, if insignificant, whereas in Ireland, because of the repatriation of profits from multinationals, the difference can be substantial. Did the Taoiseach explicitly raise this point with the Commission President?  Did the President respond and did he concede there was a unique difference in the circumstances of Ireland compared with similar countries?  The relevant measure of comparison for <i>per capita</i> income in Ireland relative to other member states is not GDP but GNP.  Did the Commission President say this would be taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been using that argument successfully since 1988 in discussions with the EU.  I negotiated both rounds of funds in 1989 and 1993 in two different ministries.  However, the argument is not as strong as it was in 1988 and 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a valuable argument and repatriation still has a significant effect.  It will probably continue because of the extent of the multinationals' effect on trade figures, particularly exports, and the wealth creation capacity of the Irish economy.  I raised this as part of our case in discussions over the years and President Santer is familiar with the argument.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn knows from the ECOFIN data, we have done remarkably well.  The median figures of the 11 countries likely to be included in enlargement create a huge imbalance.  The central point of our stance in negotiations is a fair transition arrangement for Ireland under Objective One status, particularly where there are regional imbalances and many parts of the countries fall below the status statistics.  That argument is for another time.  The central issue now is the transition arrangement for Objective One status for the entire country.  We will do far better on that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that as we will shortly begin the procedure for ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, enlargement presents great opportunities, such as the continuation of peace and stability in Europe, which is a prerequisite for prosperity?  There are great challenges <Col N="690" /> as 106 million people, with an equivalent GNP of the Netherlands, will join the union.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach assure the House that in any negotiations on Objective One status, the arguments put forward to exclude Dublin will not be tolerated?  These arguments do not stand up because some of the greatest poverty in the country is in Dublin, some of it barely south of the Liffey.  Some people think all poverty is north of the Liffey although there is a great deal in the north, south, east and west of Dublin.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that those areas will not be excluded from Objective One status as a result of enlargement negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach's reply mean the Government's negotiating strategy is not to isolate parts of the country which are still deemed to qualify for Objective One status?  Will they be separated from other parts of the country which are now over the median level as measured by the commission?  For a variety of reasons set out in the documentation available to any Minister or Minister for State, will the Government argue for a unique, once-off period of transition in which the entire State will be deemed to qualify for transitional, structural and cohesion funds, depending on the label they are given?</P>
      <P>If we are given transitional funds, as distinct from the traditional and institutional form of Objective One status, who will be the deciding body in the allocation of those funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> When we negotiated Objective One status in the golden age of Structural Funds, we used the poverty stricken areas referred to by Deputy Gay Mitchell and the west, which has suffered graphically from depopulation and economic dehabilitation, as trump cards with which to negotiate the maximum amount of Structural and Cohesion Funds.  As soon as the funding came on stream, these areas were discarded, apart from occasional initiatives and pilot projects.  There has been no specific targeting of resources in those areas.  The demographic trends in the west are downward and show no sign of stabilising.  There are huge poverty traps in inner city Dublin.  If the Government seeks Objective One status for the entire country, will it institutionalise poverty in these areas?  It is obvious that unless specific targeted measures are introduced in these areas we will not convince the European Union and they will be discarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, in reply to Deputies Mitchell and Quinn, the Government's objective in the Structural Funds negotiations is to obtain continued access for the entire country under Objective One status, funding over the duration of the next financial perspective, 1999-2006, and satisfactory transition arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's second question, the Commission must agree to any change in a country's single region status and the overriding objective of maximising Structural Funds to <Col N="691" /> Ireland in the next round.  In reply to the Deputy's third question as to how they will operate, if we obtain the agreement which will be negotiated in the next 12 months, this round of the next financial perspective will be delayed until elections in Germany and other countries are completed. The next round of the Agenda 2000 proposals put forward by the commission will be next month. They will state their negotiating position and talks will continue.  That is our negotiation stance and we will have to see how it pans out, especially the 75 per cent argument and the regional imbalances. It will be better for the country to obtain Objective One status transition arrangements.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Jim Higgins, in 1989 and 1993 we did not argue on the basis of the exclusively peripheral and marginalised areas in rural or Northern Ireland.  We negotiated on the basis of the status of our national figures <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries.  The fact that we were below the European average entitled us to Objective One status. This worked well.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into regional arguments. As I have said all week at another forum, I believe in an inclusive society and inclusive talks. That also applies to this issue.  I do not want to break up the country as it beats my negotiating stance on Objective One status.  It is true that some parts of regions have not done as well as others.  However, regions have done well and when the CAP and the Structural and Cohesion Funds are taken into account, it is interesting to see the extent of funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a considerable backlog in relation to infrastructure and social development.  We must continue to pursue negotiations to deal with that.  After 2006, and certainly around 2010, the Union will comprise in excess of 600 million people from approximately 25 countries.  It will include some very poor regions which will not be on this island.  Therefore, we have only a short period to deal with the infrastructural backlog and that is what we must concentrate on now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>During his meeting with President Santer, did the Taoiseach raise the question of institutional reform and the lack of democracy in the way many decisions are made? Did he press on him the urgent need to reform our institutions before taking on board a large number of new members when it will be virtually impossible to operate under the existing institutional arrangements?  Did he also raise with <Col N="692" /> thePresident the size of the budget projected to the year 2006 which will be too small to cater for the large number of very underdeveloped countries which are about to accede to the European Union?  Will he address the financial contribution that Ireland might make to a budget to assist those underdeveloped countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not discuss institutional reform on that occasion.  That was discussed at a recent European Council meeting.  Many of the reforms the Commission would like implemented were dodged in the negotiations on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Member states did not agree to the proposals which would have meant a better structured enlarged Europe in the future.  That was not the fault of the President of the Commission who felt they were desirable and useful changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are.  In terms of the size of the projected budget, at this stage it is unlikely that the financial perspective will alter the percentages. The major contributors believe it is unlikely that new countries will be in for the next round.  The former cohesion countries argue that the 1.27 per cent rate will not meet the needs.  I do not believe France, Germany, the Netherlands and others will change their negotiating position on that matter in the short term.  As the enlargement discussion moves forward and we know the beneficiaries of the new Structural Funds, the position may change.  As of now, however, the financial perspective will remain in the 1.27 percentage points category on the basis that the enlargement process will not have reached the stage where there would be a drain on the funds. That is satisfactory if that is the case, but we are putting forward arguments in that regard.</P>

      <P>The communications unit is a new initiative designed to serve all Government Ministers and to improve and expand the services provided by the Government Information Service. The principal focus of the unit is to provide a comprehensive information service to Government Ministers and their Departments on Government policy initiatives and developments and alert them to any problems which may arise in relation to their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated annual cost to my Department of running the unit is £80,000.  This covers the manager's salary, shift allowances paid to six staff on secondment from Government Departments and other general administration costs.  Salaries of the staff seconded continue to be paid by their parent Departments.  There is no increase in Civil Service staff numbers.  There is a cost offset in that the service has the effect of lowering costs across all Government Departments by reducing duplication of work and expenses in the media area.  The work of the unit means that Departments are reducing the use of external companies and no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes, thereby saving Government Departments considerable costs.  Based on the work the unit has undertaken since its inception, it is estimated that in a full year the unit will achieve substantial cost savings on behalf of Government <Col N="694" /> Departments and provide a far more efficient service.</P>

      <P>The small number of staff involved in the monitoring unit pick up issues to do with Government policy and initiatives and speedily and efficiently inform Departments, ministerial offices, secretaries' offices and information units in various Departments.  Having been made aware of these matters, Departments can then act promptly.  Wherever there is a Government policy initiative it makes all members of the Government and Departments aware of what other Ministers and Ministers of State are doing.  The unit provides a service for all Government Departments and reduces the use of external companies by providing tapes and videos of programmes.  The communications unit does not follow the initiatives through but makes Government Departments aware of them so that they can act on them.</P>

      <P>I rebut those remarks.  The civil servants involved are focusing on providing a comprehensive information service to Government Departments.  They are part of the Government Information Service.  What was happening in Government Departments in recent years on key issues, such as Northern Ireland, was that several Departments were using outside agencies to get the one tape, for which they paid enormous amounts of money.  In my Department last year about £12,000 would have been paid for such tapes.  They are now available to all Departments at no cost other than the cost to the information units in Government Departments.  This is not a unit spinning anything about anyone or for anyone. It merely passes on information on INN, PA or the national airwaves of RTÉ and Government Departments acting on the policy initiative.  It is making Government work and is providing a better service to the taxpayer rather than the massive duplication and unnecessary expenditure that has taken place in the past.  This House should pay tribute to the GIS for having thought up this remarkable initiative.</P>

There were two occasions since June when this country was not represented at the General Affairs Council, by a Minister and where our permanent representative &mdash; a very capable individual &mdash; stood in.  I invite the Taoiseach to give to Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, a wider range of powers than originally intended on 26 June.  Will he seriously consider assigning responsibility for European Affairs to a Minister of State other than to the two involved given the enormous array of important issues on the agenda of the European Council?  We are missing <Col N="697" /> them by default because of priorities elsewhere with respect to Northern Ireland.  The job cannot be done because people cannot be in two places at the same time.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State have priorities in respect of Northern Ireland.

The number of meetings in recent months in Northern Ireland is unprecedented.  This is likely to continue for the next few months.  I will keep the position under review.  The Minister or Minister of State normally attends the General Affairs Council.  Last week the Minister spent three days at the talks in Belfast following which he was in Panama for two days.  Since then he has spent four days at the Northern talks.  He has not had even a half day off in the past 15 or 16 days.  The same is true of the Minister of State.  I hope the pressure will ease.  The Minister is anxious to attend the General Affairs Council.  If he is unable to attend, the Minister of State will stand in.</P>

      <P>Given the <i>realpolitik</i> I understand the Minister and the Minister of State, who is a <Col N="698" /> member of the junior party in the coalition, have to represent the Government properly and comprehensively at the Northern talks.  In the previous Administration there were two Cabinet Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs &mdash; doing the same job.  There was also an able Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs who did an enormous amount of complex work which required much preparation.  With respect, it is not possible for the two people to whom I have referred to do the job they have to do and also assume responsibility for European affairs.  I do not want to intrude on the privacy of the Taoiseach's party but there are people sitting behind the Taoiseach who have the necessary experience and who could assume responsibility for European affairs.  Ireland's interests for which the Taoiseach temporarily has prime responsibility would be better served.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the General Affairs Council has a supervisory role in relation to other Councils?  Where an issue which affects another Council cannot be dealt with, it will often appear on the General Affairs Council's agenda.  When the Government was formed the Taoiseach wanted to appoint a Minister with responsibility for European affairs as well as a Minister for Foreign Affairs and a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Now he sees no need to appoint a Minister with responsibility for European affairs.  Is he aware that in almost all of the other 14 member states there is a Minister with responsibility for European affairs, a Secretary of State with responsibility for European affairs or a Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs? The Minister is not able to attend all meetings of the General Affairs Council or for the duration of all meetings.  In diplomatic circles the absence of Ministers has been commented upon.  Given its importance, the Taoiseach will always attend the European Council.  A Minister or Minister of State should always attend the General Affairs Council which deals with urgent matters.  The Taoiseach should reconsider the need to designate a Minister with responsibility for European affairs to deputise for the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he is unable to attend.</P>

A number of Ministers of State who have great knowledge of European matters have been able to stand in, enabling the Minister and Minister of State to concentrate on Northern Ireland.

        <i>(Mayo):</i> Questions Nos. 1 and 2 related to the ongoing Structural Funds negotiations. Will the Minister of State agree that we are conducting negotiations at a time when we are effectively handicapped by the lack of statistics? To get a proper picture of what is happening in the regions, one would need to have more up-to-date statistics than those for 1994 and 1995. The statistics for 1996 and 1997 would be more relevant.  I appreciate there has been a backlog but it is not wise to conduct vital negotiations at a time when more up-to-date statistics are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that in conducting negotiations one must have the most up-to-date statistics available.  As he is aware, the largest allocations are made to those regions which have objective one status, those regions where gross domestic product <i>per capita</i> is less than 75 per cent of the Union average.  On the last occasion Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> was less than 75 per cent of the Union average.  Consequently, the whole country qualified for objective one status.  I am conscious of what the Taoiseach said about the policy aspects.  The regional accounts show that in 1993 GDP <i>per capita</i> in <Col N="700" /> four regions was below the 75 per cent limit &mdash; in the mid-east the figure was 53.1 per cent of the EU average; the Border areas, 68.6 per cent; the midlands, 63.9 per cent, and the west, 59.2 per cent.  The accounts to be published in March will contain figures for the years 1994 and 1995.  The publication in March will deal with the years 1994 and 1995.  I take the Deputy's point and would be happier if it dealt with the years 1996 and 1997. The way the information is compiled on the basis of regional accounts is apparently extremely complex. I am looking into this matter to see if there is any way it can be speeded up.  It involves measuring the gross value added-gross domestic product by the eight regional authority regions. Apparently that is a complex procedure because some people live in Dublin and work in the Middle East and it is necessary to allocate their income to whatever area they receive it from.  The Deputy is correct that the information should be more up to date but as of now we will have to operate on 1994 and l995 figures.  I do not believe that will change the policy in regard to Objective One status.</P>

      <P>I read the programme of events published recently by the Government.  Events are being held all over the world from Tasmania to the United States and many of those are very worthy.  The Humbert landing at Killunmin was a very significant event.  When I was Minister for Tourism and Trade a number of years ago I asked the organisations in Mayo to submit proposals to assist in the national concelebration of that bicentennial landing.  Will the Minister indicate if the discussions with the French military authorities are to deal with some of the French training ships appearing again off the coast of Killala as they did 200 years ago?</P>

We are having discussions with the French Military Attaché to see whether it is possible to put some event together which would commemorate the landing.  We do not have a specific event in mind, but we hope to work out something.  As the Deputy probably knows, we have given some funds to the Merriman Winter School which was held recently in Westport as Gaeilge.  That school and the Humbert Summer School which is to take place in Ballina have majored on the 1798 Rebellion. If there are other events throughout County Mayo the committee, which is an interdepartmental one, would be pleased to consider them. Despite what the people of Wexford have to say, we are particularly aware that Mayo played a sterling role on that great occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The insurance ombudsman scheme launched in October 1992 is funded by the insurance industry. To ensure the independence of the Ombudsman the operation of the service was divided into three component parts.  The first is a board comprising executives who are elected from those insurers taking part in the scheme.  The second is a council made up of nominees from within and outside the insurance industry.  The council in the second part recruits and appoints the Ombudsman subject to the approval of the board in the first part.  The third part is the Office of the Ombudsman where policyholder disputes are referred and resolved.  The member companies of the scheme are bound by the Ombudsman's decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> The present Ombudsman was appointed at the outset of the scheme in 1992.  In seeking the endorsement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the launch of the scheme at the time, the insurance industry expanded the draft terms of reference at the behest of the Minister to provide greater discretion to the Ombudsman in the determination of issues in dispute between policyholders and insurers.</P>
    <P>As documented in its recent five year review, the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman has proved an outstanding success as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  It has settled disputes and complaints by mediation and conciliation in addition to issuing written adjudications in more intractable cases.  It has provided an invaluable service to the consumer and has led to improved sales practices and claims handling by insurance companies participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>As the insurance ombudsman service is a private sector scheme, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on matters related to the conditions and duration of the appointment of the Ombudsman.  Neither would it be appropriate for me to comment on the resignation of a member of the council.  Our primary concern is to ensure, in the interests of the consumer as policyholder, that whoever holds the office of Ombudsman is enabled to discharge the responsibilities of that office in accordance with the terms of reference. I will be meeting members of the council at their invitation to discuss the existing arrangements for the operation of the scheme in light of experience gained over the past five years and to satisfy myself these arrangements are being operated in a way which enables the Ombudsman to independently and effectively discharge the functions of the office in accordance with the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I will ask him a supplementary question, but first I wish to express again my extreme annoyance that two of my priority questions were ruled out of order, particularly the one on Ryanair.  I do not want to get into a dispute with the Chair, but it is very bad that a priority question cannot be tabled to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister of State indicate the exact background to the publicity surrounding the resignation <Col N="703" /> from next August of the current Ombudsman, Paulyn Marrinan Quinn?  What are the facts relating to the resignation of a significant member of the Insurance Council that was put in place as part of that system?  Is the Minister of State aware that the recent adverse publicity calls into question the effectiveness of such arbitration systems?  The Law Society has recently set one up and if this system is jeopardised in any way by this type of publicity it will not be good for this type of arbitration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have listened to what I said.  This is a private sector scheme.  It is not a statutory body or organisation and I have no role or involvement with it.  I am not privy to the exact situation.  I am aware there has been some conflict within the office of the Insurance Ombudsman and between some council members.  I respect the decision of the Ombudsman and her right to decide what she should do and when she should do it.  I admire the work she has done.  I issued a statement congratulating her on the great success of her work over the past four and three quarter years and I wish her continued success in her office until she vacates it next August.  My responsibility is to the consumers. It is to ensure there is an effective Ombudsman service available to them so that this great work, which is on a par with the best internationally, can continue into the future.  It is also to ensure that where there are difficulties involving policyholders they can be resolved in an amicable and fair way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that the Minister of State does not know the background to this matter.  He is responsible for the appointment of the Ombudsman and he will make it next August when the current Ombudsman resigns.  In his letter of resignation Mr. McLaughlin said the Ombudsman had to fend for the scheme against its creators in the insurance industry from the beginning.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State if there is any allegation that the Ombudsman could not do her job properly and that the insurance industry was thwarting her in some way.  Has the Minister satisfied himself that there is no veracity, or nothing behind the reason Mr. McLaughlin resigned?  Is the Minister satisfied there is no thwarting of the role of the Insurance Ombudsman by the insurance industry? Surely, that is the Minister of State's responsibility.</P>

      <P>My responsibility concerns the legislation governing the insurance industry.  For the third time I repeat that the Insurance Ombudsman is a private sector appointment, funded by the insurance industry, in three component parts, involving a board that is responsible for procuring the funds, assessing the budget and making the funds available; a council, whose function it is to recruit an ombudsman and to provide staff, the board then ratifies the decisions taken; and the third part is the Insurance Ombudsman's office itself.</P>
      <P>I am absolutely satisfied with the conduct and performance of the Insurance Ombudsman and her office.  There are difficulties and it is a matter for those involved to resolve them.  I have taken an initiative to ensure consumers are protected and that this system is sustained in future.  I will be meeting with the council soon to discuss this matter, but a cooling off period is important.  The council has requested a meeting with me and when it is appropriate I will have that meeting.</P>

      <P>Another question of mine was ruled out of order today, a Cheann Comhairle, about a raid on the Vintners' Association by the Competition Authority.  I was told it could not be answered because it was not a matter for the Minister.  The Minister of State tells us he has neither hand, act nor part in the role, work or resignation of the Insurance Ombudsman, yet the question has been taken.  I am completely at a loss to know where I stand with regard to tabling questions.  When Ministers do not want to answer a question they claim they have no role.  On the other hand the Minister of State says he has neither hand, act nor part in this as it is a private scheme, so why was the question taken if that is the case?  A Cheann Comhairle, you have to understand how frustrating it is to table a question which is allowed, yet the Minister of State washes his hands of the matter saying it has nothing to do with him.  This is not good enough. This matter has been reported in the newspapers and I am quite sure the Minister of State and other Ministers have been apprised of it.  I want some answers.  Why did the Insurance Ombudsman feel it necessary to resign her position when somebody who has done only five years in the job would be in the running for another term? Although I know I cannot get anything more from the Minister of State by way of reply, I am not satisfied with his answer.  Why will he not answer the question?  Can he explain the background to the resignation of the person from the council?  The Minister of State knows the answer.</P>

When it comes to international comparisons, it has done a tremendous job.  I have no doubt that the record of this Insurance Ombudsman &mdash; who has decided to vacate her office as and from next August, and who made a public statement to that effect recently &mdash; has set a standard that will ensure the office will be sustained into the future.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to mention that for the record.  Does the Tánaiste accept there is deep unease among the constituent parts she is trying to put together in a hotchpotch arrangement?  I understand the working title of the new body is the Company Development Agency.  There is deep unease among experienced staff in Forbairt, the Trade Board and in the training section of <Col N="707" /> FÁS at what many feel was the non-consultative way in which the Tánaiste pushed this project in recent months.  The Tánaiste referred to some reports, but there is considerable fear that she wishes to push relentlessly something that is deeply ideological to her and her party.</P>
      <P>Has there not been minimal consultation with the trade unions involved, especially those relating to Forbairt?  Is it not fair to say, therefore, that there is a basis for the staff's unease?  Having spoken to a significant number of them it seems to me they are not even aware of the steering committee's terms of reference, nor the method by which the Tánaiste appointed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Broughan said.  It is true that not everybody is happy with the approach, but the vast majority of the staff and their representatives to whom I have spoken &mdash; and the vast majority of representatives of indigenous industry, whom we are trying to support &mdash; believe the Government's strategy is appropriate.</P>
      <P>It has nothing to do with ideology.  Whether you have one, two or three agencies is not a matter for ideology.  I am certainly no ideologue. What governed this decision was not the number of agencies but rather the strategy required to support and develop indigenous industry.  It is a fact that when the IDA was given the sole focus of selling Ireland abroad, it outperformed every other agency because it knew what its focus was and could concentrate on it.  A similar focus was not given to the indigenous sector, as a result of which it has not been supported in the most appropriate way.</P>
      <P>Bringing things together and creating a new dynamic agency is not an end in itself; it is the result of trying to develop the most appropriate strategy as we head into a new millennium and a much more competitive global economy in which Irish companies must operate.  We have to export 84 per cent of what we produce.  Irish companies have to be export driven and the support we give them must be provided in that context.  Irish companies should get the support they deserve, rather than having to wander around seeking support from three different agencies.  That causes confusion, particularly to smaller companies which are not competent to deal with the various schemes and agencies.  By bringing things together and creating something new and dynamic, there will be a clear focus.  The needs of industry, which is the number one priority of the Government in terms of industrial policy, will be better served.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister has her steering committee in place, but as regards the mechanism by which this will work, how does the Minister anticipate the training side of FÁS would work, for example, given that much of its work is done for multinationals which have just established here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Is it not a fact as regards the trade board that a significant proportion of small Irish exporters have severely criticised this move in that they feel a more targeted development body abroad, such as the trade board has been over the years, would be the best way forward?</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to resolve the difficulties we are led to believe will exist in appointing a chief executive, given the chief executive of the trade board is employed on contract and earns more than £125,000 per annum and the Forbairt chief executive, who is tipped to become the chief executive of the CDA, earns somewhere in the region of £75,000 to £80,000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was wrong in 1993 for the trade function to be taken from what was then the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  By virtue of that decision, agencies were established which should never have been established.  I will not be driven by the interests of any person, nor do I know who the new chief executive will be.  It will not be a matter for me but for the board designate to decide, and they will do it on the basis of fair procedures.  However, we must not allow the interests of any one person or board to dictate what should be done in the interests of indigenous industry.</P>
      <P>When we took office, I asked officials in my Department to establish a high level working group to examine the support structures in place for indigenous industry.  It established a number of facts: that there are 45 different support schemes in place spread across the three different agencies.  That is clearly an excessive number of schemes.  Some companies were able to benefit from many of the schemes.  Others who may have needed them may not have benefited from any of them because they did not have the wherewithal to find their way around that enormous bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Second, it established that 61 per cent of the companies assisted by An Bord Tráchtála were the same as those assisted by Forbairt.  It does not make sense to me that Irish companies, small ones especially, must wander around knocking on doors wondering where they will get help.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where I disagree with the Deputy.  If we want to support the growth and development of indigenous industry, we must do it by first carrying out an assessment of its needs. At the moment, it is supply driven; the State decides on its needs rather than talking to it to find out what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to assist industry in six different ways: first by assessment, second by sectoral positioning, third by research and development, fourth by diversification in terms of export markets, because Irish industry is too heavily dependent on the UK market, fifth by assistance in finance arrangements and sixth by human resource <Col N="709" /> development and training.  If industry is to be given the most comprehensive and appropriate package and if taxpayers' money is to be used as effectively as possible in this process, all that must be brought together.</P>
    <P>It is better for Irish firms to go to a one-stop shop where they will admittedly have different people advising them, because different people have different expertise, but they will receive from the one agency the sort of comprehensive support they need and deserve to grow and develop.  The approach the Government has adopted is the most sensible one, notwithstanding the difficulties.  There will always be difficulties when one seeks to bring things together.  It is often better to leave things as they are.  However, I am no agency junkie.  We must not be dictated to by the needs of specific agencies.  We must be governed by the needs of firms, especially in the competitive global economy.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that more than 8,000 small retailers closed in the past four years in the United Kingdom due to the continued rise of the multiples; the plans if any, she will put before Dáil Éireann to enable the small retailing and supplier sector in Ireland to withstand the onslaught and, in particular, the position regarding the continuing of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Developments in the retail sector here and in other EU member states are closely <Col N="710" /> monitored by my Department.  A comprehensive legal framework is in place in Ireland through which anti-competitive behaviour and abuses of dominant position can be challenged.  This framework is enforced by the Competition Authority and by the Director of Consumer Enforcement. If this legislation is at any time seen as deficient in terms of responding to developments on the retail sector, it can be reviewed to make it more effective.</P>
      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987, is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The Competition and Mergers Review Group, established by my predecessor, will examine the order as part of its terms of reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past five years the Irish retail sector has effectively been taken over by UK multiples.  Irish-owned firms are disappearing with the entrance of Dixons, Argos and Boots.</P>
      <P>As regards the last mentioned, which is topical, I have a letter sent by Boots to a customer which stated it was working with its suppliers to ensure, where it made economic sense, that business was done with local suppliers and that they would be retained if that were the case.  With the economies of scale of the UK multiples, that argument does not hold.  Walking down Grafton Street today, is like walking down Oxford Street in London with the number of British multiples on the street.</P>
      <P>While I welcome competition, it is very important trade is protected.  Legislation must be introduced to protect the small businessperson. What is delaying the Competition and Mergers Review Group whose task was to produce a national strategy on competition policy and regulatory reform?  It is badly needed to ensure the sector is not cleaned out.  Is the Minister aware an 85,000 square foot super store is planned for Dublin?  For that to break even, it would require a turnover of £50 million.  The consequences for the sector will be devastating.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware Boots is importing stock overnight from its UK headquarters and that a huge number of suppliers are now delisted?  That has major consequences for the trade and I appeal to the Minister to request the management of Boots to clearly state their position and to follow through on a commitment given on entering the Irish market.  It is now the largest single chemist in Ireland.</P>
      <P>While I welcome competition, it must be fair. Otherwise, in five years' time, Ireland will be a sad country dominated by large multiples and small businesses, which served this country for 50 years, will be gone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share many of the Deputy's concerns.  It is important that we ensure indigenous industry is competitive because no legislation will protect any sector if it is not competitive, and our capacity to introduce legislation is limited. We cannot prevent those who may not be Irish from owning Irish industry.  The challenge for us <Col N="711" /> is to ensure that we develop our economy in such a way that our own companies can compete and can avail of the huge opportunities that exist not just on the domestic market but on the wider European and international market.  The key to that is having the right support structure in place to ensure that the State, in so far as it can, supports the growth and development of Irish industry and does it in a very targeted and responsive way.</P>
      <P>I am not sure why the mergers group has not yet reported in relation to the matters he has raised.  They are an independent group who were established by my predecessor.  They have met on many occasions and I look forward to receiving their report as quickly as possible.  I have also agreed to meet the Small Firms Association together with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to discuss their concerns in relation to the Boots take-over of HCR.  In so far as I can, through moral, political or ministerial pressure, I will seek to ensure that Irish suppliers and Irish industry get an opportunity not just to continue to supply products to companies being taken into foreign ownership but also to sell their products into the wider chain of those companies.  That applies to Tesco and many other companies.  My predecessor got commitments that were subsequently given to me, both orally and in writing, in relation, for example, to Tesco.  The only way of ensuring that those commitments are enforced is through the force of political and moral pressure. There is no legislative way we can enforce them because no legislative commitments were given, and that is the difficulty.  That is the challenge for a very small economy like ours.  With the right strategies and the right support for our own entrepreneurs, we can meet that challenge, but we will not necessarily meet it by legislation because our capacity to legislate is very limited.  I reiterate that if our competition laws are not as effective or as vigorous as we would wish, they will be reviewed and strengthened.  However, when our competition laws are enforced, we sometimes get complaints from certain sectors who might not like what is happening.  There are many difficulties and many different perspectives that a Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has to take into account.  We have to ensure that the consumer gets value for money and can buy products at the lowest possible price. Sometimes there is a conflict between the interests and rights of the consumer on the one hand and those of the companies on the other. The challenge is to have the most appropriate and effective balance.  We can do that with the right strategies and the right support.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to do that. Deputy Owen already has the commitments and I would be happy to make them available to the Deputy.  There has been an independent assessment. The bench-marking that my predecessor agreed with Tesco and carried out by the ESRI and An Bord Bia in relation to the existing Irish suppliers to the former Quinnsworth has been completed.  The idea of the bench-marking was to ensure that not only was the same amount of Irish sourced material sold in Tesco stores but that it would, if possible, be increased.  Until we get the bench-marking results it will not be possible to ascertain whether or not the commitments are being honoured.  I assure the Deputy that if we can have an independent body, such as the ESRI, to monitor the commitments given on an ongoing basis, I would be delighted to do that.  I will make the commitments available to the Deputy and to any other Deputy who is interested.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 33, 70, 86, 88 and 118 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> The Government has decided to establish a new client centred support structure for indigenous enterprise involving the creation of a new support agency.  An Bord Tráchtála and relevant elements of Forbairt and FÁS will be incorporated into the new agency.  These are the bodies under the aegis of my Department which I am proposing to restructure.</P>
    <P>The policy basis for restructuring is set out in a briefing document entitled New Support Structures for Enterprise Development &mdash; the Issues and Concepts Outlined.  Copies of this document have been placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members.  The document summarises the analysis and proposals brought forward by the high level group which advised me on the rationale and need for the new structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When it was first mooted that An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt would be amalgamated in some form, there was some indication that An Bord Tráchtála was not very happy.  Is the Minister satisfied that the wisdom of this amalgamation has been accepted by An Bord Tráchtála and that the board is satisfied that its functions as outlined will be properly carried out under a bigger combined board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot be satisfied that the board is satisfied.  I do not think the board ever made a decision in relation to this matter.  I met the chairman and the chief executive of the board on a number of occasions, and other board members made contact with me, in relation to this matter.  To some extent the Deputy is asking me to apply 20:20 vision five years down the road. When it was proposed to establish the IDA as a stand-alone agency in 1993, there was much criticism of that.  People felt it was the wrong strategy. In hindsight that has proved to be extremely successful. The fact that it has a sole focus, which is selling Ireland and bringing in foreign and direct investment into the Irish economy, has meant that its performance has been extraordinary.  It is currently attracting 16 per cent of all of the greenfield projects coming out of the United States into Europe, even though we have less than 1 per cent of the European population.  I believe that when an agency is given a clear focus, a clear mandate, and knows what it is supposed to do, we get better results than we do from the diverse and diffuse functions which the different agencies have at the moment.  To some extent we have to wait and see.  I firmly believe the approach is the right one, that we will get better value for taxpayers' money.  The small firms, the ones that do not have the competency or the wherewithal internally to access the various State agency schemes at the moment, are the ones that need help most.  They in particular can be targeted.  I believe that, in time, that will prove to be extremely successful.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister consider including the county enterprise boards and the various developmental agencies, such as Leader <Col N="714" /> and the partnership boards, in her high level review?  In other words, is she intending to have a comprehensive review?  If she were reviewing the operation of the enterprise boards, would she agree that the kind of finance that is provided to the four Dublin boards <i>per capita</i> is outrageously low?  In her own area of South Dublin and in my area of Dublin City and Fingal we tend to get roughly the same amount of finance as areas which have a quarter or one tenth of our population. Would the Minister agree that she should look at that area as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The county enterprise boards have a particular function.  They deal very much with micro-enterprises and are essentially involved with local development.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, has responsibility for developing the potential of the enterprise boards around the country, and that involves local initiatives. What we are talking about here is supporting the development of Irish firms that have to export product not just into the UK market where many of them are too heavily concentrated at the moment, but into the wider European and international market.  Perhaps in time we could look at the role of the county enterprise boards. However, we have to begin somewhere, and it is right that we should concentrate on the companies that currently are the responsibility of An Bord Tráchtála and Forbairt rather than widen their remit to include literally everything.  The county enterprise boards are in their infancy in terms of their potential and whether they continue in their present format is a matter for Government decision.  It would be premature to bring all this under the umbrella of one national agency given that the purpose of the boards is essentially to grow and develop micro enterprises at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the creation of a new State agency incorporating the business training element of FÁS, is it true that only 6 per cent of unemployed persons have contact with FÁS?  In light of this amalgamation and the skills shortage, does the Minister propose to enable unemployed people gain more support from FÁS?  Will she confirm that the apprenticeship system is such that FÁS cannot keep up with the demand and that some apprentices have to wait for a year and a half before they receive training?  Will the Minister give a guarantee to improve these positions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the element of FÁS which will be incorporated into the new agency, between 60 and 70 people work in this division which devises training programmes for industry. It is a very small part of an organisation which has more than 2,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much in what the Deputy said.  FÁS must concentrate on equipping those who are unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, with the skills which will enable them <Col N="715" /> obtain jobs in the labour market.  Unfortunately, FÁS's role has been somewhat diffuse in recent years.  My predecessor prepared a White Paper on human resource development and we are examining the most effective way of implementing many of its fine recommendations.</P>
    <P>In fairness to it, FÁS increased the number of people on the community employment scheme to 41,000 over a relatively short period.  This has involved massive organisation and readjustment on its part.  The community employment scheme has two functions, social economy and training for the labour market.</P>
    <P>We need to look more clearly at the focus of our training agency.  The new board of FÁS was recently appointed.  I had a policy decision sent to the chairman and the board so that the members would be aware of what the Government expects of them.  This will be helpful as it is unfair for a State agency not to know what the people for whom it is working, the Government and the public, expect of it.  The function of the agency is to implement the policy of Government.  We will be able, with some changes, to get a more effective response from the training agency.</P>
    <P>I am aware there are gaps in apprenticeship training.  To some extent we have become victims of rapid growth, particularly in the construction industry.  It has been very difficult for the training agency to keep apace with the developments on the ground, but we will be able, with some adjustments, to deal with the gaps.  We also want to develop the concept of traineeship, which is very different from apprenticeship.  There is a commitment to increase the number of traineeships to 5,000 over a short period.  I hope we can achieve this as it will provide opportunities.</P>
    <P>Approximately 70 per cent of those who do FÁS training courses gain access to employment. This is a very good record given the large number of people for whom FÁS has to provide. However, the priority must be to improve on this, particularly for the long-term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I am currently examining, in conjunction with my Department, a number of options which, if they come to fruition, will significantly improve the provision of seed capital for early stage business.  I hope to be able to report more fully on these options soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the ceiling for BES investment to £250,000 will refocus the scheme on those smaller firms which find it most difficult to attract <Col N="716" /> equity from outside investors.  In addition, the reduction in the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent will contribute significantly towards increased investment across the economy, including the investment requirements of the small business sector.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that there has been a resurgence in the supply of venture capital in recent years.  In this regard I would particularly like to mention the seed-venture capital measure under the operational programme for small business.</P>
    <P>Given the initiatives already in place and those that are still at planning stage, it is not my intention to introduce an equity finance vehicle modelled on the US Small Business Investment Corporations, SBICs.  The SBIC programme is the principal means of US Government support for encouraging the growth of small businesses at an early stage of development.  The approach is based on a partnership with private capital.  The SBIC model is, therefore, similar in many respects to the seed-venture capital measure already in place.</P>

When my party Leader, Deputy Quinn, was Minister he sought to put in place a major funding mechanism for start up enterprises.  The Minister might consider revisiting this proposal as a matter of urgency.  A significant number of small business people are trying to put in place a mutual type structure based on European models, something we never had.

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability of finance is less of a problem now than it was 12 or 18 months ago because of the low interest rates.  The difficulty relates to what is termed very high risk potential new business and the conservative attitude adopted by financial institutions in assessing whether they will support certain ventures.  We have operated a number of seed capital venture funds over the past year.  For example, a total of £83 million has been provided for small business through these funds.  I am currently in discussion with one of the major banks in relation to a new venture fund for what could be described as high risk business.  Under this fund very generous and substantial aid will be given to new enterprises in <Col N="717" /> high risk areas which might not normally be assisted by a financial institution.</P>
      <P>On a review of agency structures and how the State supports indigenous industry, obviously the issue of finance will be thoroughly examined. There is a debate about whether we should give grants, soft loans or equity investment.  We have not decided which is the best way to assist industry but most of the arguments tend to favour equity investment rather than grant aid.  We will put in place an appropriate mechanism to support companies in the early stages of their development.</P>
      <P>The American model has helped many corporations and micro systems, including Intel and many of the multinationals we are so happy to have here.  We want to grow our own multinationals but this has been subject to much criticism. There have also been many failures.  There is no obvious way in which to help small business to gain access to finance and a combination of mechanisms is required.  Flexibility is desirable depending on the enterprise and the sector in which it has to operate.  I assure the Deputy that this is a matter of great concern which we will examine in the context of the support given to industry.</P>

      <P>We have examined the European, American and other models and do not have a closed mind on them.  There are three or four different ways in which one can help companies and it is a question of using the available resources which come from either the Irish taxpayer or the European taxpayer in the most effective way.  For example, £31 million of the £83 million to which I referred came from the European taxpayer.  We must use the resources available from whichever source in the most effective way, and I have an open mind on how we should do this.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 38, 43, 46, 77 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>The decision that the State should withdraw from the provision of export credit insurance followed a review of the scheme carried out by my Department.  The review demonstrated that only a very small proportion of our total exports were covered by the scheme.  This meant that a reasonable spread of risk &mdash; an inherent part of any insurer's portfolio &mdash; was not available to the State.  In addition, the past few years had seen a considerable advance in the involvement of the private sector in this market with ongoing development of new products designed to meet the needs of exporters.  The total number of companies which availed of the restructured scheme was fewer than 20.  Only four of these were what might be described as core clients.  Having regard to this and the developments in recent years in the private market I am satisfied that the decision to withdraw will have minimal effect on industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When was the report prepared?  Is the Minister satisfied that companies who wish to export to the more troubled parts of the world will not be prevented from doing so because of the lack of export credit insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The review was commenced by the then Minister, Deputy Kenny, when the trade division of my Department was part of the Department of Tourism and Trade.  I think the review began early in 1997.  After the controversy which surrounded export credit insurance in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the then Minister decided to review the scheme.  At that time, 80 per cent of exports covered by the scheme were dropped.  We were left with a small scheme covering short-term political risk and medium-term political and commercial risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the restructured scheme was introduced in 1991, only 20 companies or 44 renewals were covered, involving £66 million of exports.  To put that in context, we exported over £30 billion of goods in 1997.  The scheme was almost defunct and covered only four core clients at the time it ceased to operate.  The private insurance market <Col N="719" /> is providing cover for all these markets.  Most of our exports to the markets covered were not covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>Insurance must have a balanced portfolio or it is not insurance.  If one is covering only emergency or crisis markets then that is not an insurance scheme.  If the State wishes to support companies to access those markets then it must do so by methods other than insurance.  If taxpayers are funding only companies exporting to emergency markets where the likelihood of not being paid is extremely high, then they are carrying a heavy risk.  In that context taxpayers are not involved in insurance.  One has to balance the good cases with the bad and strike the premium on the basis of such a balance.  I am satisfied from the review and the consultations in which we have engaged that no Irish company will be adversely affected.  The private sector will be able to cover the needs of exporters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is satisfied, at present, that no one will suffer and that the need for the scheme is not as compelling as before.  However, is she keeping an open mind on the situation?  The scheme may be required at a future date if the Celtic tiger becomes quieter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the conditions in the Irish market which dictate whether the State should be involved in export credit &mdash; it is the conditions in the markets to which we export. The private sector has developed enormously in this area since 1991.  This is why only 20 companies were covered by the scheme since it was restructured in 1991.  At the time the scheme ceased, only four companies were involved covering a relatively small amount of exports.  The State's liability was £18 million at the time of the cancellation of the scheme.  I am optimistic that all that money, which is covered by the scheme in the event of those companies not being paid, will be met by export credit insurance.  We will continue to honour any commitments entered into.  That is the nature of insurance.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no longer any need for the State to be involved in export insurance and the Government accepted my recommendation. It was costing my Department about £400,000 per year to administer the scheme.  The staff and administration resources involved in the scheme can now be deployed in other tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time the scheme was cancelled none of the four companies covered was involved in the agricultural sector.  One exported cranes, one exported pressurised vessels, the third exported floor coverings and I cannot recall the products exported by the fourth company.  I do not accept the comments made by Deputy Burke. In one nine month period in the late 1980s, one company received £100 million of cover to export to one market.  That was not right or fair for that sector and was rightly criticised by members of the Deputy's party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to go back to those days.  This is why the scheme was restructured in 1991 and there have been very few takers since then.  The majority of Irish exports into the markets covered were not covered by the State scheme but by the private sector.  This proves that extensive cover is available from the private sector. If a future Government wishes to re-enter this area there is nothing preventing the legislators from doing so.  It is a decision for Government.</P>
      <P>The State will vigorously defend a well known case whenever it comes to court.  I do not know when that will be.  There are no ongoing costs because the case has not come to court.  Whenever this happens there will be legal costs.  I hope these costs will not have to be paid by the State. I am confident that the State will win its action but if it had to pay its costs it would be a small amount of money in comparison to the benefit derived from avoiding these policies.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Finance Bill. I also welcome the statement on a pilot scheme for the upper Shannon region.  There is no doubt but that a number of rural areas will seek inclusion in the pilot scheme.  Given the proper incentives and encouragement from the Government and the EU life can be restored to these areas, although perhaps not at the standard to which we had been accustomed.  We have seen pressure on family farms and this will continue. We must put in place alternative employment and ensure a good cross section of jobs is available for skilled and semi-skilled workers and for graduates. A cause of great hardship in rural communities is the movement of graduates to large urban <Col N="722" /> areas in search of employment.  This issue must be addressed and I have no doubt it will be in the life time of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill and look forward to its successful passage through the House.  A basic issue is income tax rates.  Before the recent general election Fianna Fáil, in conjunction with the Progressive Democrats Party, gave a clear commitment to reduce income tax rates.  We went before the electorate with that policy which a number of people described as flawed.  It was said we should concentrate on widening bands, etc. However, the people supported our party and voted us into Government to pursue the policy we highlighted during the election.  We said we would reduce the top rate of tax whereby people would in time pay no more than 50 per cent of their salary in PAYE and PRSI.  The Finance Bill takes the first step in that direction by reducing the top rate of tax from 48 per cent to 46 per cent. More importantly, the standard rate has been reduced from 26 per cent to 24 per cent.  These new rates constitute the single biggest reductions in income tax rates for some time.  Overall the package amounted to approximately £500 million in terms of savings to ordinary taxpayers.  It is important that this be spread throughout the PAYE community.</P>
      <P>We also increased the bands by £200 for a married couple and £100 in the case of a single or widowed person.  This will result in substantial increases in net take home pay for people in the PAYE sector.</P>
      <P>Regarding rural Ireland, I am particularly pleased with the increase in allowances under the farm pollution control scheme.  The eligible limit for a 50 per cent special year one capital allowance for expenditure incurred on necessary farm pollution control measures is being increased from £20,000 to £30,000 with effect from 5 April 1998.  This will continue until 6 April 2000.  This is important for rural Ireland and is a welcome additional incentive in the context of the problems of farm pollution.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill contains one or two novel aspects with which I am pleased.  One of these concerns tax relief for company donations to charities.  This issue has been debated for some time.  The group representing the charities approached all the parties before the budget as they did in previous years.  They received positive soundings from the previous Government but this did not translate into action.  I am pleased that for the first time ever this level of tax relief for company donations to charities has been provided for. This relief will apply to all charities and not just domestic charities as announced on budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new element of the Finance Bill which is particularly welcome is the provision of tax relief on certain donations to disadvantaged schools. This constitutes a major innovation.  There are some schools in every county with disadvantaged status.  By their nature these schools have difficulty <Col N="723" /> raising funds through the normal level of fundraising engaged in by the parents' council and the board of management.  Now, a company which gives £1,000 to a school will receive tax relief.  There is an untapped source of income for many schools in this context and I encourage the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to publicise this new relief as widely as possible as people are not fully aware of it yet. This provision will have major benefits for schools which have been unable to raise funds through local voluntary fundraising efforts.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased by the provision for increased capital allowances for nursing homes.  It is important that nursing homes which come up to the required standard receive additional capital allowances to allow for an increase in the numbers being accommodated.  This is important given the ageing population and the costs associated with people maintained in hospitals run by health boards.</P>
    <P>A longstanding anomaly in the taxation law relates to the commencement rules.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, it is clear that if quorums are called in this House, committees will be unable to operate their business.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions dealing with capital allowances for nursing homes and look forward to their successful passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the tightening up of the commencement rules for income tax.  For traders and professionals commencing business, there are different dates of assessment in respect of the first three years of trading.  It has come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners that many companies deliberately organise their business and taxation returns in such a way that they can avoid paying income tax by ensuring income falls within a particular tax period.  There is evidence of abuse in this regard and I am pleased the Minister has put forward proposals to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant change is proposed in regard to self-assessment, for people who make their own tax returns on an annual basis.  For people paying preliminary tax for the years 1999 to 2000 the present deadline is 1 November 1999.  It is proposed to extend that date to allow one additional month for the payment of preliminary tax.  On the other side of the equation it is proposed to bring forward by two months the date for filing of returns, from 31 January to 20 November.  There is no change in respect of payment of the balance <Col N="724" /> of tax for the year.  Complaints have been received from practitioners that by bringing forward by two months the date for filing returns difficulties will arise for small businesses and practitioners, but that is balanced by the fact that the date for paying preliminary tax is extended by one month.</P>
    <P>When self-assessment was introduced some years ago the deadline for payment was set at 30 November.  That date was decided so that it would not coincide with the tax amnesty, and in the Bill the Minister is simply changing the date. I am pleased the Minister indicated his long-term intention to bring the tax year into line with the calendar year.  The fact that the tax year starts on 5 April is an anomaly.  That type of tax year bears no relation to anybody's daily life and it has its traditions in a British calendar which was dispensed with many centuries ago.  This measure is long overdue and I look forward to people's taxation returns coinciding with the actual calendar year.  If that happens over the coming years, it will represent a major advancement.</P>
    <P>The provisions in respect of the credit unions are being withdrawn completely.  If there is one lesson which should be drawn from this entire episode it is that when an organisation such as the Irish League of Credit Unions makes proposals to the Department of Finance, it should ensure that it fully reflects the views of its membership. Because of the outcry since last week, it is clear to everyone that what was being proposed by the league to the Minister for Finance was totally at variance with its members' wishes and upset practically all of them.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the invaluable work the credit unions do.  People avail of loans for back to school expenses, confirmations, holidays, cars, motorbikes, house improvements and other expenses as they may not have sufficient credit ratings with the local bank.  Credit unions have provided, and continue to provide, an invaluable service.  They have been badly served in recent times by the senior people in the organisation who may feel they had good reason for their proposals but who certainly were not in touch with their memberships.  I am pleased a forum has now been established between the Department of Finance and the credit unions to discuss this issue throughout the year.  The Irish League of Credit Unions should consult its membership and listen to their concerns.  When they return to the Minister for Finance, they should return with views which reflect the concerns of their members and not views which have been dreamt up at national level.  They caused unnecessary concern to their own members and it should be acknowledged that is where the proposals originated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction of the interest rate being charged by the Revenue Commissioners from 15 to 12 per cent.  There has been a general reduction in interest rates in recent years and it is appropriate that the monthly rate be reduced from 1.25 to 1 per cent.  The corollary of that is that those tax payers who were paying their tax <Col N="725" /> in advance or had overpaid their tax were getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary 15 per cent rate of interest being provided by the Revenue Commissioners was totally out of line.  I am very pleased the 12 per cent rule has been introduced and even at that I believe it is very generous.  I hope the Revenue Commissioners will ensure this interest is only paid to people who have genuinely overpaid their tax bills rather than those who deliberately overpaid it to avail of this interest.  I do not know how that can be done but I hope it can be examined on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge this is the first time ever that the amendments to the Finance Bill will be made with reference to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which was a tremendous volume of work put together by successive Ministers for Finance in recent years.  We now have a composite Taxes Consolidation Act which will make the work of amending a Finance Bill such as this considerably easier in the coming years.</P>
      <P>A number of restrictions have been placed on the capital allowances available in respect of people investing in hotels.  I am pleased to note this does not apply to owners and operators.  The restrictions seek to specifically exclude high income earners who invested in hotel projects without having any hand, act or part in their management but merely used them as vehicles to reduce their income tax bills.  These provisions specifically exclude a number of Border counties which have not done as well as other counties in terms of hotel development in recent times.  The list of counties should be extended on Committee Stage to include counties such as Laois, Offaly and others in the north Munster area.  Over recent years, there has been a plethora of hotel development in major cities but some rural counties such as Laois have received no hotel developments under this scheme and it is appropriate that they be given an opportunity to get one or two good quality hotels in the county to improve the business environment and the potential for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the biggest announcements made in respect of the Bill relates to urban renewal although provisions in respect of this are not contained in the Bill as published last week.  An announcement was made at the weekend that the current urban renewal scheme is being extended until 31 December 1998.  The deadline for completion of projects had, until now, been 31 July but this additional five months will allow for the completion of a number of major projects throughout the country, 12 of which are based in Portlaoise.  This extension will allow for the development of a multi-screen cinema complex and additional shops and houses in Portlaoise. The extension will allow schemes which were at an advanced stage to be completed and without it they would not have proceeded.  I particularly <Col N="726" /> welcome that measure, details of which will be announced on Committee Stage.  I welcome the fact that all towns and cities included in the scheme will be able to avail of this extension.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister announced he would bring forward taxation proposals in respect of the new urban renewal scheme on Committee Stage.  I look forward to discussing these to ensure they are provided in areas which need extra tax relief for the integrated schemes which are planned.  It is important to state that the location of the towns and areas concerned will not be revealed on Committee Stage but will be based on recommendations made by the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the basis of submissions received from local authorities.  Only the financial and taxation incentives which will apply to these areas will be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have heard a great deal of discussion here today about the economy and house prices.  As a new Deputy in this House, the enormous increase in house prices is one of the issues about which I am most concerned.  This is a taxation issue, a grants issue, a land availability issue and a profit issue and all of these issues will have to be brought together before this problem can be solved.  I look forward to the Government working on this problem in the months ahead as I consider it to be one of the priorities with which the Government must deal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of a White Paper on rural development by the Department of Agriculture and Food and I hope to make some proposals for taxation incentives on Committee Stage whereby people could avail of tax incentives for investment in their own area rather than having to invest in an urban renewal scheme in a neighbouring town.</P>

      <P>I do and I have a few scars to show for it.  However, I survived them and Deputy Fleming doubtless will too.  If that is the spin emanating from Upper Mount Street, it will have to be better polished because it simply will not <Col N="727" /> wash.  The Deputy has doubtless been in the company of Mr. Tony Smith and other members of the Irish League of Credit Unions at the AGM in Killarney or in various parts of the country.  I met an avid member of the credit union movement, who has a furniture shop in the Deputy's native town, on the train to Killarney last spring.  The idea that head office is not in touch with those people simply will not wash.  Nevertheless, it was a loyal and reasonable effort to put a few bandages on the corpse and the Deputy should be complimented on it.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill is, if nothing else, honest.  Running through it is Deputy McCreevy's long held Thatcherite view that if one looks after the rich, the poor are forced to look after themselves. If there is one defence to be made of Deputy McCreevy, it is that he is both honest and consistent.  As Minister for Social Welfare he sought to attack the position of the least well off in society.  His first Finance Bill is simply more of the same.</P>
      <P>What should this Bill have sought to do?  It should have made it easier for people to move from welfare to work by increasing personal allowances substantially.  It should have removed workers on average incomes from the marginal tax rate and buttressed social partnership, which is already under threat from the outrageous behaviour of the management at Ryanair.  The Minister has tackled none of these issues.  He has succeeded only in exacerbating the problems.  In that sense, this is a highly irresponsible Bill from an irresponsible Minister.</P>
      <P>Thankfully, the Minister has been forced to withdraw his proposed changes to the taxation of credit union earnings in a public and humiliating fashion.  Last week on the front page of <i>The Examiner</i> the Minister was hung out to dry by the Taoiseach.  Taking their lead from their party leader, Fianna Fáil backbenchers soon followed suit, some with less elegance than the previous speaker.  However, in fairness to those backbenchers, their political antennae are more acute than those of their Minister who defended his policy approach on radio over the weekend.  I was mesmerised as I listened to him digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole on midday last Saturday. He was clearly unaware the ground would be swept from under him and that he would be buried in the mess he had created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not act alone.  These measures were brought before the Cabinet and its members agreed to them.  The outrage expressed by the public at the Minister's intentions appears to have passed him by.  He sees no reason there should be dissent from his intention to impose obligations on credit unions which he has not imposed on either banks or building societies.  He does not see a contradiction in his pursuit of credit union savers and his Government's refusal, ably argued <Col N="728" /> by the Minister, to open the Ansbacher accounts to full and public scrutiny.  That is either arrogance or mere simplicity on his part.  I believe it is the former because nobody could accuse the Minister of being simple.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McDowell pointed out last night, the Minister is an old-fashioned class warrior for the affluent sections of society.  However, competence is important.  The Minister is so out of touch with reality that he is obviously impervious to advice.  His attempt to implicate the Irish League of Credit Unions in his proposals was the act of a Minister with his head in the sand.</P>
    <P>On the most significant issue facing the country since independence, the advent of the single currency, the Minister has also adopted a head in the sand or, as he prefers to call it, a &ldquo;buttoned lip&rdquo; policy.  That policy is not conceived in the national interest but in the Minister's fear of his capacity to get it right.  Despite advice from economists, stockbrokers and commentators that he should declare the rate at which Ireland will enter EMU, he has refused to act.  In the absence of direction from the Minister, the markets have made their decision.</P>
    <P>What else can one expect from a Minister who is so in thrall to Thatcherite ideology in respect of markets?  How dare a Minister deem to or contemplate intervening in a market mechanism?  If the market is to decide everything it should not be interfered with, particularly by a politician. This appears to be the Minister's ideological position and at least it has the merit of being consistent. However, the Minister has gambled that entry at the rate set by the market will not have inflationary consequences.  While he is known to be fond of a flutter, on this occasion he is not gambling with his own money.</P>
    <P>Much attention has focused on halving capital gains tax and the Minister's failure to explain why he believes it is necessary.  He does not see the need to vindicate his decision.  It is a good idea merely because the Minister thinks so.  He believes his job is to facilitate the serious wealth earners in this economy at the expense of the ordinary taxpayer.  That it will further exacerbate the housing crisis for young couples appears to be of little concern to him.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will table amendments to reverse this proposal.  I do not expect the Minister to accept our arguments, which are based on social equity, so we will table additional amendments to exempt property from the overall measure and to impose a time period for which property must be held before the owner can avail of the reduced rate.  If the Minister accepted the first amendment, the other would be redundant. I do not expect him to do so but he should be given a number of opportunities to intervene on behalf of people who are currently being priced out of the housing market.  When he fails to act, he can explain why they are being denied a basic right, a right their parents had.  Contrary to the line being spun by Fianna Fáil contributors to this <Col N="729" /> debate, the measures in relation to capital gains tax impact considerably on the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister's ideological approach to taxation policy carries over to the changes in income tax proposed in the Bill.  In response to parliamentary questions he has been forced to concede that these proposals will lead to an increased number of people paying the higher rate of tax.  If one were to read the various political spins on the budget, which were put out with dramatic failure by Fianna Fáil advocates and apologists, one would think this measure had resulted in a reduction of the number of people paying tax at the higher rate.</P>

      <P>Listen to the parliamentary replies from the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>The Minister's refusal to index the bands and personal allowances instead of reducing the rates was designed specifically and exclusively to benefit the better off.  It was known who would benefit in the Law Library.  The business classes which would benefit from this measure were known. They were so far away from marginal relief with regard to bands and allowances that the only way to deliver the money to that group of people, who were not shy about making contributions to the political parties on the other side of the House, was to reduce the top rate of tax by 2 per cent.  It is no surprise that the Minister has been forced to concede, under the pressure of parliamentary questions, that the declared intent and effect of the measures are at variance with what has happened.</P>
      <P>The benefit accrued to marginal rate taxpayers, regardless of their income, will be 2p.  Increasing the bands, which we proposed, would have led to benefits of about 20p or 22p for each pound by which the band was widened.</P>

      <P>Take the example of a person earning the average industrial wage and paying the higher rate of tax.  There is no question about which approach available to the Minister would have benefited such a person.  However, the Minister is not in politics to look after these people and, self-evidently, neither is Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P>This Bill is wrong.  It runs counter to the spirit of Partnership 2000 at a time when other issues, about which this Government seems determined to do nothing, have tensions running high.  It fails to increase incentives for people to move from welfare to work.  It fails on any objective test of fairness.  It will undermine any approach based on consensus and mutual support, to resolve the serious problems facing this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, who, unlike Deputy McCreevy, has a reputation for looking after the man and woman in the street, is notable only for his <Col N="730" /> inability to rein in the excesses of his Minister for Finance.  His reaction to the changes in credit union taxation announced last week, which he approved at Cabinet, was more akin to that of Bart Simpson &mdash;&ldquo;What Bill?  I did not see any Bill.  It was not me, I was not there and even if I was you could not prove it.  Nobody saw me.&rdquo; This sentiment ran across the headlines of what used to be known as <i>The Cork Examiner</i> but which is now, following the demise of the <i>Irish</i> Press, known as <i>The Examiner.</i></P>

It is clear the honeymoon this Government thought it was having is definitely over.  It is staring at defeat in two by-elections.  In the absence of any real leadership, the Government is floundering from one crisis to the next and sections of the Cabinet appear to be in a state of paralysis.

The method of personal assassination disturbs me.  Policies are ignored because the truth does not read well in the context of the plans of those opposing the Minister.  They know the facts will give the lie to the picture that is painted of the budget and the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to the budget which cut tax rates for one million taxpayers by 2 per cent and increased tax bands.  For four budgets under the previous Government, there was no decrease in tax rates although there was widening of tax bands, as there was also this year.</P>

      <P>This budget and the Finance Bill will be seen from 6 April next to be the most beneficial for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition parties, especially Deputy Noonan, attempted to portray the budget and the Finance Bill as an attack on the poorest and weakest in our society.  The facts contradict this. When one remembers Deputy Noonan's history, including the &ldquo;can of worms&rdquo; statement, it shows <Col N="731" /> he does not allow the truth to get in the way of a good story.</P>
    <P>The tax deduction package of £500 million is the highest ever tax handout in the history of the State.  Allied to this, the Minister has closed many tax shelters used to reduce tax liability by some of the wealthier members of society, to ensure greater equity in taxation.</P>
    <P>With increased exemption limits, thousands of people will be taken out of the tax net.  Deputy McCreevy said the take home pay of a single person will increase by 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent. Taking the average industrial income of £14,000, this means £350 for a single person and £560 at the higher rate, which is £6.70 to £10.77 per week. For a married couple with two children the increase will be from £6.70 to £14.80 per week. These are real increases, not the fiction we heard from Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>Listening to Opposition speakers, one wonders whether they bothered to take the time to read the Bill or the Memorandum, or listen to the Minister's speech.  I will mention some of the sections which will highlight how positive this Bill is, how it will help job creation and social inclusion and how it will provide better facilities and a more equitable tax system.</P>
    <P>Employees holding shares in their company were previously required to hold them for five years before disposing of them as otherwise there was a clawback.  Section 10 reduces this period to three years.  This is a welcome provision which helps employees.  Section 11 is an anti-avoidance measure which will stop people transferring assets offshore in order to avoid tax on income arising from same.  Job creation is highlighted in section 12 which contains a relief to encourage the long-term unemployed to take up employment. It gives an incentive to employers, as well as employees.  Employees receive an increased tax allowance for themselves and their children. Employers are given extra allowances against their profits.  This is a double deduction for wages and PRSI.  It is a welcome job creation provision aimed at putting the long-term unemployed back on the jobs market.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is a welcome provision socially and gives tax relief for gifts, in money or in kind, to help socially and economically disadvantaged schools.  Many of these require extra funding and people now have a greater incentive to contribute. Section 17 provides for the granting of capital allowances for the construction, extension or refurbishment of buildings to be used as private nursing homes.  We appreciate the need for good quality accommodation for the elderly.  As our population grows, the Exchequer cannot cater for the demand.  It is important that private investors can provide that accommodation at a reasonable cost.</P>
    <P>Section 18 covers the fishing industry.  Fishing is one of the greatest sources of wealth in this country.  The quality of fishing fleets is a problem. The Minister provided for accelerated capital <Col N="732" /> allowances at 50 per cent of the cost in year one and the balance over the following seven years. Relief will be set off against other income or profits which means it will be worthwhile investing in new boats.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 refer to the extension of determination of tax relief on multi-storey car parks and seaside resort schemes.  This is essential as lack of car space is a problem in every town and city.  Many seaside resort schemes were held up because of planning objections etc.  The Minister extended the termination date for these projects. This will ensure they are completed in due course and do not become eyesores.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 27 and 28 provide closing of more tax shelters.  People have been calling for more equity in the tax system for many years.  The Minister noted their concerns and included these section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 24 limits the amount of capital allowances on buildings that can be set off against non-rental income.  This is another provision which Deputy Noonan forgot in his invective.  Under this measure people can set off their capital allowances on buildings against income derived from rent, but not against all their income.  Wealthy people tend to invest in property in towns like Youghal and Clonakilty, where special allowances apply, and this puts house prices out of the reach of locals.  Curtailment of the capital allowances set off against non-rental income will go some way to help resolve that problem.</P>
    <P>Farmers are finding the going tough.  Pollution controls are being implemented more strenuously and, consequently, many farmers have to carry out expensive pollution control works.  I welcome the increase from £20,000 to £30,000 for capital allowance purposes.  Section 31 amends the special temporary scheme of 100 per cent stock relief for certain young farmers for a further two years.</P>
    <P>Section 35 includes another anti-avoidance measure under which scrip dividends will be treated the same as cash dividends.  It provides that the issue of a scrip dividend will give rise to an income tax charge under Case /V of Schedule D for unquoted companies resident in the State and under Case III of Schedule D for companies resident outside the State.  This will mean that in future people will have to pay tax on scrip dividends.</P>
    <P>Section 37 provides for a number of changes in the self assessment system.  The return filing date will be brought forward from 31 January to 30 November in the year following the year of assessment.  As an accountant I am well aware of the reasons for introducing this measure.  Most accounts are not submitted until three or four months after the preliminary tax date, but they are the previous year's accounts.  For example, the 1996-97 accounts were submitted in January of this year but the 1997-98 preliminary tax was payable on 1 November last.  Therefore, people to avoid interest charges were required to pay 100 per cent of 1996-97 tax bill or 90 per cent of the <Col N="733" /> 1997-8 tax bill.  As the 1996-97 tax bill for most taxpayers would not be calculated by 1 November, the preliminary tax payment in most cases would therefore be a shot in the dark.</P>
    <P>Many small accountants may find it difficult to reorganise their work in the two month period, but there must be a coterminous date.  Using the calendar year for accounts purposes and filing them six to nine months later might solve many of the problems in this area.  I am pleased the Minister decided to hold off on this measure until the matter has been properly discussed.</P>
    <P>The reduction from 40 per cent to 20 in capital gains tax has been scarified by the Opposition. The rate was increased to 40 per cent some years ago because of an increase in inflation.  Inflation and interest rates have decreased.  People, many of whom were not wealthy, would not sell their properties because they would have to pay 40 per cent capital gains tax.  The reduction in the rate will encourage people to sell these properties.</P>
    <P>The credit union issue has caused great concern. Having listened to Deputies Rabbitte, Noonan, Quinn and others, it is evident they are ignorant of the tax law.  Tax was due on interest and dividends, irrespective of whether it was being paid, declared or not.  I will give a simple example of what DIRT at 20 per cent would have meant.  A person with £1,000 on deposit would be liable to £50 interest.  The 26 per cent tax rate plus levies equals £14.12 and the 46 per cent tax rate plus the levies equals £25.12. DIRT would have been at 20 per cent i.e. £10.  Thus, there would have been a saving of £4 for taxpayers on the lower rate or £15 for taxpayers on the higher rate. The Minister was giving back money to people. The main concern, however, was about reporting. I am pleased the Minister has referred the matter to a working party where the problems can be discussed in detail.  There was a great deal of mischievous misinformation about the matter because of the forthcoming by-elections.  The truth did not matter.  When the measure was considered in detail people realised they would have benefited.</P>
    <P>The Government has addressed the sectors of society that need help.  The Bill is pro-taxpayer, pro-employment, pro-job creation, pro-greater tax equity and pro-development of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget and the Finance Bill that gives it legal effect contains many innovative measures.  The Opposition latched on to a few matters and made much hype about them.  We cannot ignore the fact that the amount of relief given to PAYE taxpayers, totalling approximately £500 million, is the greatest ever.  While I accept people might differ about the way that should be shared out, there was a huge payout to the PAYE earner.  Some single people will benefit to the tune of 4 per cent in their net take home pay and married people with a family will receive an increase of 5.5 per cent.  Those are considerable increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> There have been many snide references to the rich and people in the Law Library.  That is nonsense. We are talking about people on the high tax rate, but who earn approximately £15,000 or £16,000 per annum.  In one's wildest dreams one could not consider such people rich.  They may be in the high tax bracket, but people reach that bracket far too soon.  Unfortunately, there was not much improvement in that respect this year, but it is difficult to tackle all problems at the same time.  The Minister took the view that if he fiddled around with several areas he would not make a meaningful impact.  He targeted the tax rate and made meaningful inroads.  I hope other aspects will be considered in future budgets.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised the issue of exemption limits following which a detailed discussion took place on Committee Stage.  The people who suffered were those over 65 who did not get the general tax increases because they were on the exemption limits.  This year, those over 65 have regained some of the ground lost last year but for some reason, those under 65 have been harshly treated. The policy of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn &mdash; based on some internal report which seemed to suggest there were too many people on the exemption limits &mdash; has held through two different Governments.  There may be good financial reasons but it is a scandal that individuals have to suffer because of some report.</P>
    <P>While the personal allowance has increased by £250 for a single person and £500 for a married person those on exemption limits are receiving only £100 or £200.  That is unfair, it is a repeat of something that happened last year and emanates from some report in the Department.  I wish some Minister of some Government would bury the report and not sacrifice any element of the taxpaying population in a particular year.</P>
    <P>The age allowance should be improved.  I meet many pensioners who complain bitterly that they are paying tax on their social welfare or occupational pensions.  There will never be a time when pensions will be exempt from of tax but we should move in the direction of increasing the age allowance which would make some progress in that direction.</P>
    <P>There are many welcome provisions in the Bill including inducements to the long-term unemployed to take up employment and the tax allowances being offered to them are generous.  I hope it will not upset people who work with them.  This puts paid to the argument that some unemployed people have no incentive to work.  The inducements being offered are generous and encourage the employer to recruit people who have been long-term unemployed.  I agree with the measures proposed in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are some good sections which provide for reducing tax shelters which in the past a small number of wealthy individuals have used to the maximum.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for tax relief for corporate donations to schools in disadvantaged areas.  A similar provision applies tax relief on donations <Col N="735" /> to charities.  Those are welcome measures as is the incentive to people to build nursing homes. Provision is made also for a reduction in VAT on magazines.</P>
    <P>A further section deals with unmarried brothers and sisters living in the family home.  I recall three or four sets of such people who as siblings died and the house was passed on had to pay inheritance tax a couple of times.  It is reasonable to pay tax when a property is passed from one generation to another but when three or four brothers and sisters have to pay it time after time it is unfair.  I am pleased relief has now been provided. I understand people are not totally happy about it and given the rate at which the value of property is increasing, some will be clawed back into the system.  However the relief is targeted at a real anomaly and I am pleased it has been addressed.</P>
    <P>Last week the Opposition was worried about the late opening of bookmakers shops.  I have no problem with that and I do not know what the objection is.  That the law is changed in relation to bookmakers shops, pubs or anything else does not mean an individual has to work more hours per week.  Those are matters to be worked out between employer and employee.  We are all aware there are many evening race meetings. Those who are interested in backing a horse still do so.  The question is whether the bet is legal or illegal.  I see no problem whatsoever with bookmakers shops being open a few extra hours on a sunny summer's night.</P>
    <P>There has been an extraordinary fuss about taxation of credit union savings.  I am not trying to take from the good work done by the credit union movement in the past but much of what has been said in the past week is in stark contrast to the positive approach adopted last year when people lobbied us to have the Credit Union Bill introduced.  The credit union needs to make up its mind on whether it is the poor man's bank or a big financial institution.  The problem is that some credit unions are into the big league and some are not.  It is like a committee in any walk of life, committees can speak with different voices on different nights depending on who attends the meeting.  There are too many spokespeople in the credit union movement, all of whom speak from their own points of view.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement magazine which arrived yesterday announces the official opening of its new office block in prestigious Lower Mount Street on 21 February.  In the past it had an old office in the suburbs but it is moving to downtown Dublin to rub shoulders with the financial elite.  It will have to make up its mind whether it is small fry or big fry.  If it big fry and has legislation geared to its status it will have to take the rough with the smooth.  Some of the stories last week were extraordinary.  However I understand the media is looking for material and has to sell newspapers and encourage people to listen to radio and television programmes.  There <Col N="736" /> was nothing meaty in the stories but the media just had to wind up a few people.  It all created a nice image and in the context of other financial matters it was probably a good story to run with for 24 hours.  However, the manner in which the whole issue was handled by the media was scandalous particularly in view of the letters which had passed previously between the credit union movement and the Minister who did as requested.</P>
    <P>While some of the credit unions are large and have total assets of £2.6 billion, some are small and provide the same service as in the past.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the budget I do not like, and which is linked to the credit union, is the proposal to increase DIRT on special deposits.  When my colleagues in a previous job get their lump sum, and go on early retirement, and invest it they pay a low rate of tax on the interest.  That special low rate has been changed by both Governments. Unlike ten years ago, the Department of Finance is of the view that there is no threat to exchange controls.  I am worried about the small saver because deposit interest rates are pathetic.  It is predicted that when we join EMU mortgage interest rates will fall.  This means deposit interest rates will also fall.  I am concerned about the image being created.  There is no respect for old fashioned values.  People are not being encouraged to be thrifty and to save for a rainy day.  The major financial players, be it the Irish Permanent or the AIB, have reported large profits.  On the other hand, those with a few thousands pounds on deposit are being offered buttons.  If interest rates fall, consideration should be given to encouraging people to save rather than live for today and to hell with tomorrow.</P>

      <P>There is no need to dwell in detail on the positive features of the budget because anything that was given has been taken back 45 times over by the Government.  On balance, given that there was £500 million available, the rich did better than the poor.  The correct balance was not struck.  As happens when people break their pledges, there is trouble brewing.  It appears that some in the trade union movement are far from happy about the way the benefits were distributed.</P>
      <P>This is a crucial time for the economy.  As legislators, we should consider which sectors are performing well.  During the past seven or eight years there has been a high level of investment.  The construction industry is performing well; job creation has been nothing short of phenomenal; interest rates and inflation are low, while the IDA has been very successful in attracting foreign investment.</P>

If we join EMU at the middle rate of 2.41, some sectors of the economy will go through a rough time.  If we join at a lower rate, this will create havoc in the agriculture sector.  As we are all aware, we will not attract the same level of Structural Funds as in the past.  Countries with weaker economies than ours are seeking to join the European Union and they will have to receive their share of the cake.  There is a need for sewerage schemes and improved water supplies in many small towns and villages.  The road network also needs to be improved.  Who will make up the shortfall in funding?  We will have to fight harder to ensure most parts of the country but particularly the west, the midlands and the Border counties retain objective one status.</P>
    <P>I had to smile when Deputy Noel Ahern tried to blame the media for the credit union fiasco. The entire Cabinet is involved in the formulation of the Finance Bill.  It is comprised of 15 experienced Ministers who decided in a cold and calculating way that the 2.8 million credit union investors who save to spend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clear, when one considers what has happened since they got their hands on the propeller, that Members on the Government side were shedding crocodile tears on the Credit Union Bill last year when on the Opposition benches.  The Cabinet decided to tax the small man.  That is the philosophy underlying the Bill which has shades of the men in mohair suits in Fianna Fáil in the 1960s.  Were it not for the efforts of the three Independent Members it would become law within the next few days.  The Cabinet was going for the jugular on this occasion and the Minister for Finance, unjustly, has had to carry the can.  That is the reason the people will never give Fianna Fáil an overall majority.  Fianna Fáil will not win the two by-elections either for the simple reason that nobody trusts it.  This is the most serious injury inflicted on it since it took office.</P>
      <P>The legislation that Deputy Rabbitte piloted through the House last year placed the credit union movement on a sound footing.  I hope it will prosper and be able to rub shoulders with the best on the high street.  Small is beautiful.  It is a co-operative movement and the backbone of the country.  At times it appeared as if Deputy Noel Ahern was sneering at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has a number of positive features.  Section 17, which deals with the provision of relief for private nursing homes, is a step in the right direction and an excellent idea. They appear to be based in every rural village and there must a need for them given that there are now so many elderly people.  It appears that aspect of rural life will continue to flourish.  I <Col N="738" /> hope the subvention will be increased in line with the costs of staying in a nursing home.</P>
      <P>I am not sure how the Minister for Education and Science will deal with the provision for tax relief on personal corporate donations to disadvantaged schools.  I hope the disadvantaged areas will not include only the inner city.  There are disadvantaged schools in rural Ireland and I assume that provision will be extended to them.</P>
      <P>Wearing my hat as chairman of the Fine Gael agricultural group I met a deputation from the IFA pigs committee last week.  Because of recent rules laid down by the EPA, pig farmers will no longer be allowed to stock their animals at the same intensity as they did.  They will be required to keep fewer pigs in each pen.  I agree with that, but the implication is that pig farmers will have to double the size of their piggery buildings.  As Members will be aware the provision of such buildings is very expensive.  I and the Fine Gael spokesperson on agriculture and food, Deputy Coveney, will table an amendment to the Bill to ensure a special allowance will be made available to pig farmers who have to provide such buildings to ensure the pig industry is kept on an even keel.</P>
      <P>A line was devoted to the rural renewal scheme in the budget and another line is devoted to it in the Finance Bill.  If there was good news about that scheme I am sure we would have heard a good deal more about it.  I hope that scheme will not be a &ldquo;lucky bag&rdquo; job and that whatever will be provided will be relevant to the depopulated areas along the banks of the Shannon.  I hope the scheme will be people oriented and will not deal only with habitats and so on.  I await its provisions with interest.  Unless enough people are living in a rural area such a scheme will not generate the type of activity that is needed.</P>
      <P>I hope the urban renewal schemes when announced will be realistic and will enjoy the same success as the old ones.  I will make a strong case for Tuam in County Galway.  It missed out on a number of occasions in the past and I hope it will be included this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Connaughton for sharing his time with me.  The debate has run on fairly predictable lines.  The Minister began by singing the wonders of his legislation, he was quickly followed by his acolytes who supported him and Opposition speakers accused the Minister of all sorts of inadequacies and claimed his policies will result in dreadful consequences.  As an Opposition speaker I will shortly line up my pot-shots at the Minister and the policies of the Government, but there are areas in the Bill that should be acknowledged.  Efforts to tighten tax loopholes to make tax evasion more difficult must be welcomed, even if the general public have a right to expect even more of the same.  Difficult as it is to slip from the Opposition mindset, it is difficult to commend the Minister too much because in the areas where he is heading in the right direction he seems to be heading forward somewhat slowly and grudgingly.  Given the leeway <Col N="739" /> he has had to initiate major change and reform, he seemed to travel a most peculiar route, eliminating very few tax anomalies but helping to create and to exacerbate social anomalies where those who have are to receive more while those who have not must wait.</P>
      <P>The Minister may argue, as have his lapdogs in this debate, that this Bill is but the first in a series of Finance Bills that will bring about social equality.  If that argument were true and was not just a desperate attempt to cover the shame the recent budget brought on the Government, it means the areas the Government and the Minister have chosen to highlight first are those issues that benefit the better off in our society.  By his actions the Minister has shown himself to be practising the doctrine of &ldquo;the poor must wait&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Green Party views this Bill as it viewed the budget, as yet another exercise fiddling around the edges of a system that is beyond reform and needs to be utterly and totally reconstituted.  The ways in which the Government acquires finances and the ways in which such funds are spent are typical of a system that thrives on anomalies and laughs at the idea of social equity.</P>
      <P>The debate which surrounds the fair payment of taxes has concentrated on the difficulties of the PAYE earner.  It is undoubtedly true that of the total amount of taxes collected here too many of them are collected through the PAYE system and that within that system too much of the burden is carried by low and middle income earners, but it is also true that the total amount of owed taxes collected here as a proportion of gross national product is among the lowest of all the OECD countries.  That must mean there are many citizens who are paying very little tax, a disparity this Bill is helping to further entrench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Green Party has consistently asked several of the previous Ministers for Finance to seriously consider the ideas of green taxation.  Some of those Ministers have paid lip service to the idea, promising that their next budgets and future Finance Bills would contain such principles, but unfortunately the scripts remain unwritten.  The greens believe that the use of fiscal and other measures can reward beneficial activity and discourage harmful practices.  If properly introduced, green taxes can more fairly distribute the tax burden and introduce true tax equity into the system. A major green tax would be the introduction of a carbon-energy tax.  If operated as proposed, it could raise a considerable amount of revenue, some of which could be offset against taxes currently raised against labour.  Such remodelling of the cost structure would increase the costs of resources, but would reduce the price of labour and would act as an incentive to increase competitiveness in general.  Such economic benefit would be matched by considerable environmental improvements.  However, the response of the Minister for Finance has been the same as that of his predecessors.  He is indifferent to radical tax reform.  He must be aware that the impending <Col N="740" /> arrival of tax harmonisation within the European Union will mean that such taxes will have to be introduced, but if he approaches it the way he is going about it these taxes will be introduced as additional and not as replacement taxes.</P>
    <P>The area of transport is particularly well placed to benefit from the introduction of effective green taxation.  Our system is riddled with anomalies where free car parking spaces are provided to employees and where employees who receive free bus and train passes are taxed as having benefits in kind.  Travel expenses, particularly in the public sector, are seen as a means to increase income, but the financial incentive for public sector workers is to drive as often as possible, as far as possible and in as big a car as possible with the maximum detrimental environmental impact.  An imaginative Minister for Finance would reverse the travel expenses system so that those who choose to travel by means of public transport would receive the highest rate applicable.</P>
    <P>In waste management the proper application of &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle would go some way towards reducing the massive subsidy that local authorities continue to give away to throw-away societies.  This does not need to be an additional tax.  At present consumers give 15 per cent of their spending money to retailers for packaging they do not need and which they immediately dispose of.  As a Deputy for County Kildare, where the monument that is Kill waste disposal site is located, the Minister for Finance must be aware it is madness to adopt this sort of approach.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning, the untenable increase in house prices can be curbed by the introduction of a series of price controls and through the imposition of a windfall tax on the increase in the value of rezoned land.</P>
    <P>The only green initiative in this Finance Bill is the promise of measures to develop wind power generation.  This initiative, however, is on so small a scale that it does not even begin to consider other forms of alternative energy such as solar energy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, said he will be looking with interest at the forthcoming UK budget to see if the British Chancellor of the Exchequer follows the lead set by the Government in fiscal and taxation policies.  The Green Party is the only political group to have advocated initiatives such as a 10 per cent starting rate of income tax and a planning windfall tax, measures now being considered by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Short of being in Government, the Green Party's ideas will not be implemented.  I look forward to the time, however, when &mdash; like our colleagues in Finland, Italy and probably in Germany after next October's election there &mdash; the Greens will participate in Government.  In that case we will be able to put forward these ideas.  Who knows what will happen in the forthcoming by-elections?  We may be approached at some stage for support, but that is in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="741" /> If the Minister does not conform to green economic ideals, I hope he can produce a social policy in the best interests of the country.  The Finance Bill is a Government measure, passed and approved by the Cabinet.  When the Government signalled its intention to attack the savings of small investors in the credit union movement it did so on a collective basis.</P>
    <P>Paradoxically, there are areas that require scrutiny if the Government is serious about tackling tax avoidance.  Even seemingly innocuous means, such as An Post savings bonds and Government securities, can be used to dispose of hot money. The Finance Bill could be used to reclaim moneys and additional interest earned on these schemes if the moneys involved were shown to be linked to a deliberate avoidance of tax.</P>
    <P>The changes in capital gains tax have been commented upon by previous speakers.  I regard the halving of capital gains tax to be an obscenity. Halving the rate of that tax only benefits those who already have wealth.  It is yet another lever to widen the growing chasm between rich and poor.  The increase in the proposed reduced capital gains tax allowance is further evidence that the Minister responds only to those who are wealthy.</P>
    <P>Some of the initiatives announced in the Bill are quite bizarre.  The proposal that betting shops should be open longer demonstrates a peculiar sense of priorities when so many social problems remain to be tackled.  It shows the Minister still has to learn the lesson of why there was so much public dissension about the £20 million granted to the GAA in the budget.</P>
    <P>Tax incentives for seaside development and the Dublin docklands need to be examined in greater detail on Committee and Report Stages to ensure the right type of development is encouraged.  Previous experience of the urban renewal scheme in particular, saw over development in apartment accommodation without proper emphasis on social housing and a consequent deterioration in community life.  I speak from experience about this because we have seen the number of apartments that have been constructed in the Dublin docklands area.  Zoe Developments is proposing whole areas of the docklands for huge development, but many people in that community are worried about the development of high rise buildings in their areas.</P>

      <P>I would not prefer to see derelict sites, but the community would like to see social housing which people can actually afford.  I am sure the Deputies are aware that many couples cannot afford to continue to live in their own areas due to the rise in house prices.  The docklands area is a charter for developers, but allowances <Col N="742" /> should be made for social housing.  We have been told that 20 per cent has been set aside for social housing, but since there is no legally binding commitment the developers can promise as much as they like.  If this is to be a success we must have social housing.  The matter needs to be addressed on Committee stage.</P>
      <P>As the only Deputy who lives in the Dublin docklands area, I will not tolerate people giving a blank cheque to developers.  That simply is not on.  Seemingly, they have plans to construct buildings from ten to 14 storeys high, but people in Ringsend and Irishtown will not accept that.  I live in Irishtown.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I share an aversion to much of the rezoning that has gone on. We have that much in common, at least.</P>
      <P>The question also needs to be posed as to why so much attention is being placed on the reduction of corporation tax levels.  What benefit is accruing in terms of value added to the economy in relation to this generous regime?</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Connaughton earlier speaking about EMU and it seems more and more people are becoming worried about it.  I am reminded of Dr. Samuel Johnson's comment that: &ldquo;When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully&rdquo;.  The debate on this important issue is now heating up. We know about the problem associated with the housing market and if interest rates drop, as predicted, we will see more of that occurring.  We need to address the important issue of rising house prices.  Young people cannot afford to buy a house.  It is completely out of their range.  We have lost many opportunities in this Finance Bill and while it goes some way towards tackling some of the problems, it certainly does not address the real problems of social disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I intend to share my time with Deputy Daly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to much of this debate with great interest, although the debate on the Finance Bill has become something of a farce.  The Finance Bill has become such an unrelentingly complex Bill that it is virtually impossible to cover its entirety in a traditional debate format.  It is <Col N="743" /> interesting to note that the only person who attempted to cover the whole Bill was the Minister for Finance.  Because of this rather extraordinary situation, after the Minister for Finance and the leading spokespersons have made their contributions, it would be prudent and wise to refer the Bill to a special Finance Committee of the House.  In that way, real work could be done involving an exchange between Members and a cross fertilisation of ideas.  While some of the ideas touched upon in this debate made good sense, others were patent nonsense.  It behoves us to recognise that absolute wisdom does not reside in any part of the House.</P>
    <P>However, we are stuck for the moment with the current format and I intend to focus my comments on five or six specific areas. There has been a quite extraordinary reaction to the general tax provisions in the budget.  This has been a good budget and it is disingenuous of Deputies to suggest otherwise. It is a well crafted budget, except for one noteworthy slip, and it should be generously recognised as such.  In fairness to Deputy Gormley, he made the point that valuable efforts were made in the budget to close off some of the tax breaks.</P>
    <P>The second point with which I will deal is the Minister's new tax incentive scheme for hotels. Talking about tax breaks leads me specifically and aptly to this.  I have some critical comments to make about it.</P>
    <P>The third area about which I will talk briefly is the seaside resorts scheme, which is currently being reviewed.  The fourth point is the issue of taxation on credit unions.  If Deputy Gormley believes the only criticism to fall on the Minister's head over the weekend came from Independents, he is sorely mistaken.  The most caustic commentary came from the Minister's side.  To his credit, the Minister recognised an error and moved quickly to redress it.</P>
    <P>The fifth point with which I will deal, which is not dealt with in this Bill, is escalating house prices.  I will also comment on one or two other propositions made by the Minister and respond to one or two of the disingenuous comments which have been made.</P>
    <P>By any objective standard the budget was a good one and the Finance Bill, which gives it effect, is also good.  The Minister and his officials are entitled to credit for the good they have done, in the same way they are entitled to be criticised for things with which we disagree.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary comment, an extraordinary attempt to mislead the electorate and it is treating the intelligence of the ordinary voter and taxpayer with contempt to say other than that this is a good budget.  In the months since the budget was produced, there has been an attempt to distract from the reality.  The budget introduced by the Minister was good and it should be welcomed. By objective standards, it is undoubtedly one of the best budgets produced in a generation.  I say <Col N="744" /> that having spent a considerable time in the past 30 years in the Department of Finance and at least a decade between this and the other House.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves of the realities.  The budget delivered more over £500 million in tax breaks to ordinary taxpayers.  That is the largest single return to taxpayers since the State was established.  It is astonishing Members opposite should try to dismiss that.  Some of the rhetoric we have heard in the past two days is astonishing, particularly that from senior spokespersons whose record is far from generous to say the least. They have tried to discount the reality that ordinary taxpayers have every reason to be grateful to the Minister for Finance.  More grist to his mill and more strength to his elbow.  I look forward to his next budget.  If he can do the same again for ordinary taxpayers, I for one will be a very happy person.</P>
    <P>I am amazed by the carping criticism, especially that from Fine Gael.  To my mind, a budget which gives back more than £500 million to hardpressed taxpayers is something which should be welcomed on all sides, especially when it is compared with what was introduced in budgets by Ministers from other parties over the past 15 years.  It is astonishing that a party which introduced a tax on children's shoes and had to go to the country over it should point a finger at this side of the House as regards collective responsibility. We bear the blame for that which is blameworthy, but it is also reasonable to expect a smidgen of generosity for the good points.</P>
    <P>The budget also contained extraordinary provisions not only for ordinary taxpayers but also for pensioners, people who are widowed and families on lower pay.  If one examines the changes to the family income supplement, to pensions and for the long-term unemployed, this is a good budget by any objective standards, and the Finance Bill, which gives it effect, deserves support in the House.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the long-term unemployed and what the Finance Bill will do for them, I received a curt note from a Labour Party activist who works in one of the centres for the unemployed asking what precisely this budget did for disadvantaged groups.  What astonished me was this was a person who was supposed to objectively analyse the budget to determine the measures in it which were good for the unemployed.  I was pleased to be able to reply in five or six pages of detail comparing the positive steps in this budget with those in the most recent budget introduced by the now Labour Party leader.  His budgets had their high points.  Some creative measures were taken by Deputy Quinn and they were generously recognised last night by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  It is astonishing the generosity never flows in the opposite direction.  In this case a Labour Party activist simply misled the people the unemployed centre was set up to assist.  I am sure the suggestion will be made that if we were in Opposition the boot would be put in but I do not think that is true.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> The Oscar for ham acting, in so far as the budget and the Finance Bill is concerned, should go to Fine Gael's Deputy Noonan.  We saw him at his most extraordinary.  He displayed curmudgeonly behaviour, hand wringing and insincerity in equal proportions.  This man certainly deserves an Oscar nomination.  If he were in the big disaster film which has been nominated, he would undoubtedly be in the running for the best actor Oscar.  As the House knows, Deputy Noonan is something of a disappointed thespian. While his performances can be very engaging, he is not sufficiently gifted as a ham actor to distract from our memories of his personal performance in ministry.  Any attack from that quarter on the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's, generosity certainly raises a laugh when one considers Deputy Noonan's generosity when it came to dealing with the unfortunate victims of hepatitis C. Enough has been said about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not; it is a fair and reasonable blow.  If the Opposition cannot take it, it should not give it.  The tragedy is that last night and today, abuse was heaped on the head of the Minister rather than there being an objective appraisal of or even an objective dealing with the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>I will deal briefly with a number of issues in the Bill.  One is the hotel tax scheme, which is interesting.  By any standards, this is an encouraging and positive scheme.  In introducing the budget and the Finance Bill, the Minister indicated the benefits and the basis of the scheme. He made the point that it will be ringfenced and that capital allowances in it will be offset only against rental income in the case of individual passive investors.  The point I made privately to the Minister about this scheme is that it is selective. For any scheme to be beneficial, it must be so.  The Minister selected seven counties surrounding the Border: Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo to benefit from the scheme.  He made the point that these areas are off the beaten track and that they have not reached their full potential in terms of tourism activity.  I hate to disagree with a Minister from my side but, while I have a capacity to be objective, I also have a capacity to be parochial. If the number of Grade A, four or three star bedrooms available in County Wicklow, for example, is compared to some of those counties, we fare very badly.  The seaside resort scheme applies in just one resort, Arklow.  I will unashamedly push the Minister on this issue, not just tonight but as the Finance Bill progresses through its later stages.</P>
      <P>This scheme is well worth developing.  If Deputies have not looked at it I would recommend them to do so in some detail.  However, the objective appraisal of where the scheme has to go requires rejigging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> The second scheme which is of interest to me is the seaside resort scheme to which other contributors have referred.  The Minister made a very good decision to extend the scheme for a year in the case of resorts where work has already been undertaken.  Will he be as generous as possible in this because environmental and planning issues delayed schemes in some areas?  A degree of additional urgency needs to be entered into the departmental reappraisal which is currently under way in relation to this scheme.  It is a very good scheme which was originally conceived by Deputy McCreevy when he was Minister for Tourism and Trade and implemented by Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance.  I complimented Deputy Quinn at the time because it was an innovative scheme.  Sadly, the Minister caved in to pressure for extensions to the scheme, some of which were, to say the least, bizarre.  To suggest that some of the areas in question were seaside resorts stretched the imagination just a little, but those people were fortunate enough to be able to exert some leverage.</P>
    <P>However, one seaside resort was left out of this scheme.  It is Ireland's original seaside resort, Bray.  This is not just a question of parochialism. That town could have benefited hugely from this scheme, and the Minister agrees with me that this is the case.  He put the point reasonably that last year when he tried to introduce an amendment to the Finance Act the Minister for Finance at the time, Deputy Quinn, shot it down, with the support of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Deputies from County Wicklow.  It is not possible to bring it in this year, because the scheme runs out in June.  I emphasise that up to £50 million of potential development is going begging on the seafront area in Bray which would revive that whole area of the town.</P>
    <P>I spoke not just to this Minister but to his predecessor and to civil servants in the Department concerned this year, last year and the year before, and I am flabbergasted at the form of analysis which they are bringing to bear on this scheme. They are arguing that the scheme is costly, that it is having negative side effects.  They talk, for example, about &ldquo;bungalow blight&rdquo; in a number of areas.  It might be better to have some development rather than none at all but, whatever about the quality of some developments, the reality is that in an area like Bray this scheme could have been the catalyst to create a huge amount of economic development which would not happen otherwise.  The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, argued last year that he would not include Bray in the scheme, first because it was not a seaside resort &mdash; that is patent nonsense &mdash; second, because it was a suburb of Dublin &mdash; that shows a very poor grasp of geography &mdash; and third, because the scheme had been extended, by himself, to too many places already &mdash; that is a poor excuse.  I have spoken to the Minister and I continue to speak with him and to civil servants. It is my concern that this scheme should be extended very quickly to the town of Bray.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> One other issue was mentioned by a number of speakers, including Deputy Gormley.  That was the issue of escalating house prices.  I am not sure whether this Finance Bill is the place to deal with that problem, but there is an urgent need to deal with it through the taxation system.  For more than a decade I have been an advocate of a windfall tax, on the benefits that people get when land is rezoned.  For example, as a result of a motion by Deputy Fox and Councillor Ruttle in my constituency recently, land in Blessington was turned from agricultural land to building land and literally millions of pounds were made in a five minute debate.  It is not unreasonable that the millionaires who were created out of that debate should make some contribution to the development of infrastructure in the constituency.  We need to have a look at this.  There is a particularly pernicious thing happening in County Wicklow, and I believe it is happening in other county councils as well.  Councils in areas faced with a lack of money to invest in infrastructure are now putting the cost of infrastructural development on as development levies.  For example, in County Wicklow an individual household development levy, in addition to the levies for specific planning costs, is running as high as £6,000 or £7,000.  That is a direct tax on young people buying new houses.  I asked a parliamentary question of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government yesterday, suggesting that it is something that has to be discouraged.  There is no doubt but that the consequence of development is that one has to invest in infrastructure.  I am surprised, therefore, at Deputy Gormley's view that one does not develop brown field sites, that one develops green field sites.  That seems to be in violation of what the Green Party are supposed to stand for.  I would urge this Minister and his civil servants to look at this issue of the relationship between the tax system and house prices.  I have already asked the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to discourage effective taxation being introduced on new houses.</P>
    <P>The tax concessions for schools have been welcomed by Members on all sides.  I listened earlier today to one Member of the Opposition cautioning the Minister to ensure that there is no disadvantage to people living on the periphery of a disadvantaged area but it is a good scheme.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill is a good Bill.  I was very pleased at the decision the Minister reached about credit unions.  I had been highly critical of the original proposals in the Bill.  The working group which the Minister set up with the Irish League of Credit Unions is a good way forward. The credit unions are not looking to be treated in a very special way.  They simply want to be treated in a way which does not disadvantage either the credit unions or their shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Bill and pay tribute to the Minister for Finance for the valuable <Col N="748" /> work he has done in the preparation of the budget and of the Bill.  Traditionally budgets signal changes that will be given effect in the Finance Bill and the time between the Budget Statement and the introduction of the Finance Bill afforded an opportunity for various lobby groups, organisations and associations to make representations with a view to effecting changes.  I would, therefore, caution against the practice which has been developing in recent years whereby completely new announcements are incorporated in the Finance Bill which are not heralded in the Budget Statement, because if difficulties arise they cannot easily be resolved.  The difficulty that arose in relation to the credit unions might not have arisen if some indication had been given in the Budget Statement of what was proposed.</P>
      <P>I support the taxation measures announced in the Bill.  I welcome the overall reduction in taxation of £500 million or thereabouts which will make a significant contribution to people's incomes.  It will certainly help to stabilise and underpin the partnership arrangement between Government, unions and employers.  That is fundamental. It is critical that we continue that partnership arrangement which has been the key to the current success of the economy.  The economy will be damaged if this arrangement is undermined in any way.  It is vital to deal with economic and social problems by way of partnership between the Government, employers, trade unions, farmers and others.  I am glad the Bill will underpin this arrangement.</P>
      <P>On the proposed changes in tax incentives, I remind the Minister of the necessity to expand these incentives.  When it was first proposed to decentralise Departments the provision of office accommodation posed a problem.  However, under imaginative design, finance and lease back arrangements, accommodation was successfully provided.  Similar schemes should be extended to other areas.  There is nothing wrong in using private sector financing to develop infrastructural services.  For example, the seaside village of Quilty in west Clare has no sewerage system. However, several builders are interested in designing, financing and constructing this project which will cost approximately £2 million on a lease back arrangement with the local authority. Today a bank announced that it made a profit of £1 million a day last year.  It should be possible to organise private sector finance in such a way that both sides win: the Department of the Environment and Local Government or the local authority wins in that the service is provided and the contractor or builder wins in that he gains valuable work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of the decentralisation programme it was suggested it would not work.  However, eight contractors and financiers tendered to provide accommodation for the office in Ennis.  The availability of tax breaks and incentives would be readily availed of by contractors, builders and financiers. Hundreds of millions of pounds are invested in legitimate investments in other countries <Col N="749" /> and a tax incentive would entice investors to redirect their money to projects here.  Some projects will never be completed without an imaginative scheme of this nature.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to give tax incentives to investors in nursing homes.  The lack of geriatric beds has been criticised and this incentive will help to improve the level of accommodation in this area.  Nevertheless there is a fear that some of the expensive developments which took place in the past few years will be put at a disadvantage as their competitors will benefit from the new tax incentives.  Will the Minister consider backdating this incentive to cover investments in institutions built by private investors in the past few years? They should be given an allowance which enables them to operate on a level playing pitch and not put at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>There was a recent debate on the extension of the seaside resort scheme and the designation of areas under the new urban renewal scheme which will be introduced later in the year.  While I welcome the decision to extend the seaside resort scheme, a number of developments may be put in jeopardy if it is not further extended.  I will not go into the matter in detail other than to say that the extension of the scheme in western areas will provide increased opportunities for the development of the tourism and leisure sectors.</P>
    <P>Consideration should also be given to including smaller towns in the urban renewal scheme.  The population figures for qualification under the new scheme may be detrimental to smaller towns in western areas which are suffering severe hardship. I am referring to towns such as Lisdoonvarna, the only spa town in the country, Scarriff, which has no hotel, Ennistymon and Miltown Malbay.  The population of these towns is declining and incentives should be given to entice people to invest in them.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance may believe that the inclusion of too many areas may be detrimental but I have not exaggerated the need to include these towns in the schemes.  Given the availability of finance, schemes should be extended, not curtailed.  The reduction from £1 million to £250,000 in the amount which can be invested under the BES will effectively bring the scheme to an end.  There is a necessity for some of the bigger schemes to be completed in these areas.  I have not exaggerated the importance of these schemes to western areas.  Given the amount of money available for investment, I strongly urge the Minister for Finance to look favourably at smaller towns and villages which have been depopulated and where businesses have closed down.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The provision of special incentives in the industry and tourism sectors will be necessary for a long time to come and it would be unwise of the Department to curtail them, particularly in western areas where the population is falling and there are derelict towns and villages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Many Opposition Deputies referred to their disappointment at the budget introduced on 3 December last.  However, their disappointment was increased when they saw the Finance Bill.  Deputy Daly referred to the practice of providing in the Bill for issues which were not part and parcel of the budget.  The Minister has learnt a salutary lesson in terms of his proposal in relation to credit unions.  The Bill is equally disappointing for not including promises made on budget day, in particular, the pilot project for rural renewal.  The Minister has given a commitment to publish amendments in advance of Committee Stage to include these provisions.  I hope that these amendments will be given to parties in adequate time.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill is second only to the budget in importance.  More than any other legislation it charts the Government's course for the next 12 months and gives an indication of the underlying economic philosophy.  Those underlying principles are the source of the greatest disappointment. We are all satisfied with the broad economic parameters within which Governments now operate and the discipline which has been foisted upon us by external forces on issues such as borrowing, expenditure and so on.  However, the disappointment was particularly acute when one considered the unprecedented opportunity the Minister had to tackle many of the underlying structural problems in the economy.</P>
      <P>Much has been made of the £500 million available to the Minister to give away in income tax reductions.  Unfortunately, he did not avail of that opportunity to resolve the fundamental problems. Fianna Fáil and the country lost the battle at the Cabinet table.  A Progressive Democrats-driven budget has been foisted upon the House which is more concerned with looking after those who have a sufficient stake in society at the expense of those who have been striving to establish themselves in a situation where they too deserve a pay back.</P>
      <P>If this budget has echoes of times past, the phrase which comes to mind is the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo;. Those who contributed most to the much heralded Celtic tiger received least from the budget.  Those who rode the tiger to greatest advantage over the past few years benefited most. Historically Fianna Fáil has portrayed itself as the party of the small man.  It has vied with the Labour Party as the voice of true labour.  Unfortunately, Fianna Fáil has acquiesced in the argument. These are not just my words; a post-budget submission by CORI is critical of the direction of the budget and claims that it is unprecedented. However, all CORI's budget responses have been critical over the years so we can take it with a pinch of salt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dangers posed by the budget to social partnership should set alarm bells ringing.  There has been a betrayal of low paid workers.  The Minister should heed the clear signals emanating from the trade union movement.  He may have opportunities <Col N="751" /> between now and the passing of the Finance Bill to row back from the provisions of the budget and introduce measure which target the real problems in society.</P>
    <P>The budgetary provisions on income tax and capital gains tax most clearly identify our reasons for opposing the Finance Bill.  Notwithstanding the Fianna Fáil-PDs' Programme for Government commitment to reduce the number of people who pay tax at the higher rate, and that the higher rate has fallen by 2 points, this budget will result in 15,000 additional taxpayers paying tax at the higher rate than in the tax year 1997-98. This is a nail in the coffin of the aspirations for meaningful tax reform contained in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>There is an obsession with tax rates.  At the same time there is an unwillingness to tackle the real problem.  Whether the rate is 48 per cent or 46 per cent, the problem is that people are hitting the higher tax rate too early.  The £500 million available for tax reform presented the Minister with an opportunity to remove a large number of low paid workers from the tax net.  By widening the bands he could have ensured that work would be more profitable than welfare.</P>
    <P>I wish to recount the example of a widow in my constituency who had a widow's pension and a job opportunity which she could not take up. She has a personal tax free allowance equivalent to £2.50 per week when her widow's pension is taken into account.  This is the problem where welfare and work interact.  This will not be resolved by reducing the top rate from 48 per cent to 46 per cent or by reducing the lower rate. It will only be resolved by significantly widening the bands.  This will benefit all taxpayers but it will be proportionately more beneficial to those on low incomes where the need is greatest.</P>
    <P>When one considers the Government's readiness to forego that element of equity in the taxation system and compare it with what was proposed and dropped with regard to the credit unions, one gets a distillation of the fundamental principles of the Fianna Fáil-PDs Government. This can be summarised as follows: if one has a large stake in society this Government will assist you in increasing that stake.  However, if one is on an average industrial wage or on social welfare and trying to get into employment, there is little concern for one's predicament.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent on the disposal of shares.  In the lead up to the general election an editorial in one of the national newspapers advocated a vote for the Fianna Fáil-PDs alliance on the basis that it was pay back time. For whom is it pay back time?  Who requested this reduction in capital gains tax?  Who is the biggest beneficiary of this measure?  It is not those on low incomes.  This measure is of no interest to 99 per cent of the population.  Is there not a danger in the lead up to a single currency that investors may be attracted by the new rate of <Col N="752" /> capital gains tax to speculate with their gains from this windfall, creating a run on the Irish currency? Is there not a danger that equity may flow out of Irish business into foreign stock markets?  This is one of the more amazing but least commented on aspects of the budget.  It is pay back time for someone but not for those who most deserve it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the Minister included in the budget a decision which is not included in the Finance Bill, but which will be provided for by way of amendment, namely, the pilot project for rural development.  It has become unfashionable in this Chamber and among reporters to comment on rural decline and difficulties in the agricultural industry.  A contradiction which many observers cannot come to terms with is that the Celtic tiger is alive and well in certain parts of the economy but not present at all in rural areas. There is an onus on Members who represent rural constituencies to stand up and be counted.  It is obvious that rural Ireland is dying before our eyes.  There is a distinct difference between rural Ireland and agriculture.  Some agricultural policies are contributing to the decline.  Two out of every three people living in rural Ireland, many of whom are not working there, are not dependent on agriculture.</P>
    <P>We must seriously examine the economic and social cost of rural decline in comparison with the costs of increased urbanisation.  Eight years ago when I came to Dublin first, it was possible to leave the House at 5 o'clock and be on time for the 5.30 p.m. train from Heuston.  The cost of increased urbanisation in terms of traffic and the economic inefficiencies which excessive traffic generates is a direct consequence of the decline of rural Ireland.  It should not be beyond the capacity of those who devise imaginative and successful schemes for urban renewal to devise similarly imaginative, though of necessity different, schemes to revitalise rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister selected the upper Shannon region, something that was never explained in detail?  What criteria were used in selecting it above other areas?  In his budget speech the Minister indicated that consultations would have to take place with the EU Commission before such a project could be finalised.  What progress, if any, has been made in this context?  We have been kept in the dark on this issue since the original announcement.</P>
    <P>The level of visible decay, migration, lack of participation in the workforce, unemployment, lack of services, poor infrastructure and evidence of decaying and dying villages and towns is something that should concern every Member representing rural constituencies.  While it may have been payback time at the last election it is now fight back time.  John Healy, the late columnist of <i>The Irish Times</i> and author of books including <i>Nineteen Acres</i>, referred to the decline of rural Ireland in the 1960s and made the statement that nobody shouted stop.  It is time somebody shouted stop.  Many of the fine qualities which are <Col N="753" /> part of rural Ireland will not survive long into the new millennium if steps are not taken.</P>
    <P>I asked about the objective criteria and studies used in selecting the upper Shannon region.  The economics department of UCC carried out a study at the behest of Cork County Council into rural decline in the Duhallow and Sliabh Luachra area, much of which I represent in my constituency. The document portrays a vivid image of the problem and contains many suggested solutions. On Committee Stage I will be moving an amendment, with the support of Fine Gael, to have the area identified in that study included in the pilot project.  I will do so because the area complies with all the objective criteria necessary to have such a pilot project.  I see no good reason why the Minister should refuse to include the area which forms part of my constituency and the constituencies of Kerry North, Kerry South and Limerick West.  I will be looking forward to the support of all my Oireachtas colleagues in these constituencies to ensure this region is included in the pilot project.</P>
    <P>A pilot project raises the question of the type of incentives which are necessary.  The most obvious incentives are those which will bring industry to the area.  However, in offering incentives we must also be aware of the difficulties existing businesses face in surviving in these areas.  Programmes of assistance, be it in conjunction with local authorities on the issue of rates or in the context of special tax rates for companies operating in these areas, could be examined.  Such incentives are necessary.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural development will also have to be tackled.  The potential of many rural towns and villages is not reached owing to their lack of adequate facilities, including water, sewerage and telecommunications.  ISDN lines, for example, are an essential element of telecommunications. Many products are exported or imported down telephone lines and there is a need for significant investment in such facilities.</P>
    <P>We could also learn from the pilot projects which have been embarked upon with EU assistance, including the area based partnerships, the Leader projects and the town and village renewal schemes which have proven very beneficial where applied.  Rural areas need the type of attention urban renewal schemes received over the past ten to 15 years in order to reverse the predominant trend of the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill deals with capital allowances for nursing homes.  In our constituency work we have all been confronted with the traumatic problem of families caring for the elderly while State agencies, including health boards and voluntary hospitals, provide an inadequate number of beds.  This is the area which causes greatest angst.  A number of years ago we recognised the demographic trends and introduced a nursing home subvention, a useful development at the time.  However, we need to keep pace with the ageing population and the fact that people are living longer.  Therefore, I welcome section 17.  The <Col N="754" /> provision should be pursued in conjunction with increased subvention rates.  There is a reluctance in the community to embrace the concept of private nursing homes when a district or community hospital is available locally.  There is always pressure on public representatives to get people into the district or community hospital. We must make private nursing homes more attractive by increasing the subvention.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the capital allowances as proposed in the budget.  We must distinguish between services such as hotels, restaurants, etc.  and services such as beds for care of the elderly.  The consumer is king when it comes to the former, but the latter services are consumed reluctantly and only when frailty and old age dictate their use.  We must ensure that investment driven by tax incentives will not compromise the quality of care.  There are provisions in the legislation whereby the capital allowances will be effective over a ten year period. However, they must only be available where they are matched by an approved level of care as determined by health boards under the nursing homes subvention legislation.  It must be recognised that such provision could be a blunt instrument used against the interests of those who without tax incentives, already provide private nursing beds for care of the elderly.  Those allowances should be available only where the need is identified, primarily by health boards which have statutory responsibility for implementing health care in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>While this is a welcome provision, we must ensure the legislation achieves the desired outcome. There may be merit in ring-fencing availability primarily to those who are already in the nursing homes business.  It would be extremely unfair if the business viability of existing nursing home owners, who invested significantly in that business and provide a level of care approved by the local health boards, was undermined by the availability of capital allowances.  In principle, I welcome this provision, but it must be adequately policed.</P>
    <P>If rural decline is the battle-cry from areas outside the pale, a specific voice within rural communities is that of agriculture.  These are extremely difficult times.  I am not suggesting the problems were created solely by a change of Government, but an unforgivable approach was adopted by the Government when in Opposition of raising expectations and making promises which could not be delivered.  It was suggested that it was only a matter of changing the incumbent in the ministerial car and live export markets would reopen, control of farmyard pollution grants and installation aid would be available to everybody, dairy hygiene grants would be introduced, agricultural headage payments would not be capped and there would never be a poor day again for farmers.  Fianna Fáil, when in Opposition, lied in regard to all those matters.</P>
    <P>It is to the eternal shame of the Minister for Agriculture and Food that at such a difficult time <Col N="755" /> for farmers he raised expectations and made promises on which he could not deliver.  Where he had an opportunity to deliver, on the issue of live exports, he has failed dismally and that is unforgivable.  Lack of confidence in the agricultural sector is reflected in our agricultural colleges, which cannot fill places to train young farmers.  That is no wonder given that the one incentive for young farmers, the installation aid scheme, was suspended, notwithstanding what the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture and Food might say about the budget. That scheme is available only to those who submitted applications prior to suspension of the scheme on 7 August last.  When we are facing difficult problems such as reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the performance of the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not heartening and does not create confidence in his capacity to deliver a good deal for agriculture.</P>
    <P>On reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the proposals by the Commission as published in recent days are frightening.  I would put down one marker in regard to our negotiating stance.  It is opportune that the Government should lift production restrictions in terms of Common Agricultural Policy reform.  It is inevitable that quotas, particularly dairy quotas, will be abolished.  It is desirable that we operate on a phased basis in terms of supports rather than, in the next round of Common Agricultural Policy reforms, face a position where all supports would be abolished, in which case many people struggling to survive would have to leave their farms because they would be unable to compete.</P>
    <P>The increased production capacity which could accrue if we were successful in negotiating in this area should be focused on small-scale producers who would have an opportunity to prepare for such circumstances.  Any instrument used, particularly in the dairy area, whether relating to clawbacks or milk quota tribunals, to provide additional production capacity has been unsuccessful in achieving its objective.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed there were no proposals in the budget arising from the excellent report submitted to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on strengthening the protection of our architectural heritage.  There are thousands of listed buildings throughout the country of varying degrees of architectural importance, many of which are in private ownership.  The maintenance of those buildings is beyond the financial capacity of many owners.  If action is not taken in the immediate future, those buildings will be beyond repair.  It is interesting to note that the European Commissioner with responsibility in this area, who recently visited this country, criticised us on this.</P>
    <P>While the report on this matter was published only recently, this is an area that is in great need. I will table amendments on Committee Stage to deal with this matter.  We must be particularly <Col N="756" /> cognisant of buildings in private ownership where the owners are not in a position to maintain them and very often have to abandon them to the elements.  There is an onus on us to introduce tax incentives in that area &mdash; the structure of such incentives is clearly outlined in the report.  Action should be taken immediately.</P>
    <P>An analysis of new jobs created in the Cork region in the past 12 to 18 months shows that all new jobs are in extensions to existing plants or new plants that move into existing advance factories available to the IDA.  I bet my bottom dollar &mdash; I hope this is the case &mdash; the next new jobs announcement in Cork, if not for an extension of an existing plant, will be in Mallow, the only place where there is vacant industrial space in Cork.  Incentives should be made available in this Bill, whether through capital allowances or a revamped business expansion scheme, whereby local communities, individuals, development associations and enterprise boards can become involved in providing the necessary factory space to attract investment to their areas.  I recognise the success of areas such as Cork city, Limerick city, Galway and Dublin, but if incentives are not made available to smaller towns, industry will be concentrated in those areas.  The Minister should consider that.</P>
    <P>Given the enormous opportunities available to the Minister, the Finance Bill is disappointing and we will table constructive amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>The Finance Bill, which gives effect to the budget, is an excellent Bill.  The budget was designed to maintain and accelerate the healthy growth in the economy.  Nobody can say that in this Bill the Government has not honoured its electoral mandate.  It encourages enterprise and helps to create jobs.  It will stimulate the economy and help it to grow at a greater rate in 1998.  That growth will enable us to introduce further tax cuts in the next budget and to continue to maintain ongoing social welfare improvements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the voluntary aspect of the Trade Union Recognition Bill.  Trade unions and their members have made a major contribution to the economy and to society.  Competitiveness is crucial to wealth and job creation.  Effective protection is available to people who voluntarily wish to join a union in the workplace.  Very effective developments under national law further regulate the labour market and include new legislation <Col N="757" /> on paternity protection, adoptive leave and the extension of equal pay.  We have employment equality legislation, equal status legislation, a review of holiday legislation, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, the Pension Act, 1990 and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>A very effective body of protective legislation exists for the private sector and others who wish to have trade union recognition.  It is very important that the voluntary aspect of this Bill is recognised as the regulatory burden currently placed on businesses is quite extensive.  It is also proposed to introduce a minimum wage Bill, a subject which will come up for discussion in coming weeks.</P>
      <P>Compulsory trade union recognition could be seen to act as a disincentive to employers and prevent them from taking on new employees. Compulsory trade union recognition will introduce even more regulation to the workforce and create a volume of law which could impede or adversely affect business.</P>
      <P>I applaud the work trade unions have done and I hope it will continue but it must be left solely to employers and employees to decide what is in their best interests in this area.  The biggest investment any employer makes is in his or her staff, most of whom are very well protected by the current regulatory reforms.</P>

      <P>The subject of trade union recognition and, specifically, the question of mandatory forms of recognition is undoubtedly a very emotive issue and gives rise to considerable passion on either side of the debate.  It is important, therefore, to maintain a proper perspective on the issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland has one of the healthiest and most influential trade union movements in the western world.  Trade unions are an integral part of our economic and social fabric and have made an enormous contribution to progress over the decades. I have no doubt they will continue to play a key role in society for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some countries have experienced catastrophic declines in trade union membership levels, Ireland continues to experience very high union density levels.  Granted, overall trade union membership dropped in the 1980s but much of this loss has been recovered in the past few years as employment began to grow again.  At the end of 1996, total trade union membership was in the region of 540,000, which was close to the peak membership figure of 552,000 achieved in 1981. Approximately 53 per cent of all employees in employment are members of unions.  Indications are that the rising trend in union membership levels has continued in 1997.  I believe Deputies will <Col N="758" /> agree this shows, certainly in overall terms, that trade unions are still a major force in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The position in Ireland contrasts very much with that in many other countries which have experienced a major decline in membership levels over the past 25 years.  Data released by the International Labour Office in November last year revealed that, in the decade to 1995, trade union membership had dropped to less than 20 per cent of workers in 48 out of 92 countries surveyed. Only in 14 countries did the union membership rate exceed 50 per cent of employees at work. The decline in some countries has occurred in spite of the fact that they have provisions for mandatory union recognition in certain circumstances. The United States is a case in point where union membership had dropped to only 14 per cent of workers by 1995.  In France, where unions have statutory involvement in works councils, only 9 per cent of workers are union members.</P>
    <P>To look more directly at the issue of union recognition, one indication of the extent of the problem is the number of recognition disputes being referred to the Labour Court.  Trade unions commonly refer recognition cases unilaterally to the court for a recommendation on whether a union should be recognised by an employer.  The number of recommendations issued by the court in such disputes increased significantly in the early 1990s, although it was not very large at any time, but has again declined in the last three years.  In 1997, only eight recommendations were issued.  This would not suggest a major union recognition problem exists.</P>
    <P>A strong legislative remedy, which this Bill represents, is really not the answer to the union recognition problem.  It flies in the face of our voluntarist approach to industrial relations and could have untoward consequences for the whole of our industrial relations and social partnership system.  We must look for other solutions to the union recognition problem.  Any solution must have the support of the social partners.  As suggested last night by my colleague Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, the continuance of deliberations in the high level group on union recognition offer the best prospect of finding a solution that will be generally acceptable.  I doubt that anybody who has reflected on this subject has any illusions about the difficulty in finding the right formula.  There is no quick fix.  Last summer, when the matter was on the agenda of the annual conference of the ICTU in Belfast, delegates were warned that they should not underestimate the difficulties the newly established high level group on trade union recognition would face.  On this Kevin Duffy was right and we must await the outcome of the group's deliberations.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that mandatory trade union recognition and changed policies that are capable of being represented as mandatory would impact adversely and substantially on inward investment in employment.  Like it or not, the consequences that a changed policy on trade union recognition <Col N="759" /> would have in relation to this country's primary standing in certain sectors would be most damaging.</P>
    <P>Many new overseas companies choose not to recognise trade unions.  The way to tackle this problem is not to introduce policies which would discourage, and possible prevent, such companies from setting up or expanding here.  It is a matter of developing solutions within our voluntarist model and it is a matter for the trade union movement to make itself more attractive to these companies. Not every trade union sees this as an impossibility.  In a broadly similar context recently, I was struck by the remarks of an official of the ATGWU who said: &ldquo;it is the job of unions themselves to recruit members, not the IDA&rdquo;.  In elaborating the point further, the official added that &ldquo;unions are chasing up the wrong tree&rdquo; in blaming bodies such as the IDA for not promoting the role of trade unions as it did in the past.</P>
    <P>The principle of free collective bargaining has been enshrined in industrial relations legislation since the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, under which the Labour Court was established.  Since then the Labour Court has applied this principle consistently, seeking to achieve consensus in industrial disputes by promoting the spirit of compromise.  The question of making Labour Court recommendations legally binding in relation to any aspect of industrial relations is one that should be approached with great caution.  To make such recommendations binding, as this Bill proposes in certain instances, would run contrary to the present system of free collective bargaining.</P>
    <P>The voluntarist approach has been the cornerstone of our industrial relations system for the past 50 years.  It is central to the social partnership of the past decade which has made an enormous contribution to the unprecedented levels of economic growth of recent years.  We tamper with the system at our peril.  What is proposed in the Bill would lead to litigation and could bring union recognition disputes before the courts.  Such developments could undermine the voluntarist system of industrial relations and could threaten the voluntary social partnership process.</P>
    <P>The high level group was mandated to report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment by the end of last year, and it did so.  It is clear we have not had the last word from the group and I am pleased the Government and social partners have agreed to finalise its work. The group sought to move matters forward, not through legislation but by the social partners and the Government working together in the context of the existing industrial relations system.  This is the only way we will find a solution we can live and work with after the dust of the initial confrontation has settled.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot accept this Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill, which was introduced by a Member for whom I have great regard, <Col N="760" /> Deputy Broughan, appears to be stuck in the time warp of another industrial relations era.  I cannot but surmise there is a degree of opportunism in its introduction.  However, that is politics. Members of the Governments parties propose simply to outline the inconsistencies in the proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, there is agreement on all sides of the House about the importance of social partnership.  We are aware of the contribution the Taoiseach made to this partnership when he was Minister for Labour by coaxing, persuading and cajoling sectors that are now regarded as social partners but which were, in those early days, adversaries in the workplace. They were coaxed to look at the broader picture of industrial relations.  The gains for workers, management and, primarily, for the strength, health and growth of the economy are now obvious.</P>
      <P>The concepts of free collective bargaining and voluntarism are fundamentally important.  Trade unionists for whom I have much admiration, such as Jackie Brosnan, the former general secretary of my union, Ruairí Roberts and Paddy Donegan, who was with the ITGWU for a long time, spent many long hours and days in smoke filled rooms trying to encourage this process.  As a result, there are effective joint labour committees in various sectors of industry.  Clearly, partnership and voluntarism have worked.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that difficulties with trade union recognition are not new and that the position of Governments has been that no major change should be made to industrial relations law and machinery unless there is agreement on such changes.  Everybody remembers the confrontations of the 1970s when pickets were placed for weeks and months at a time.  There was no meeting of minds about how major changes in work practices and management could be processed.</P>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill would have profound side effects.  It is a legislative approach while the process which has given rise to the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and its refinements, arbitration proceedings and so forth has inherent flexibility.  I caution against a return to old rigid stand-offs and refusals to engage.  We encourage parties in Northern Ireland to participate in an exchange of ideas.  Time moves on and industrial relations, trade unions and management practices also move on.  We have seen how effective that process can be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures which are perceived to favour one side, whether it is unions or management, will lead to the unfavoured side increasing the ante. If the unions are short changed, they will believe it is their function to increase the ante against management.  Management will react in the same way if it is short changed.  There is a danger, at a time when we are trying to attract investment, that there might be a backlash among indigenous industrialists and foreign investors against trade unions.  That is the last thing we want.  We are <Col N="761" /> proud of the role which the unions have played and we want that to continue.</P>
    <P>Restrictive and rigid practices runs counter to the approach in Partnership 2000.  I read some of the recommendations of the high level report and it strikes me that we should await the wisdom of those significant thinkers on trade union and management legislation who are contributing to the high level committee before we rush in and make laws we may regret.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, much as I would like to support Deputy Broughan's Bill, it is flawed and harks back to another era.  We cannot support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinBrady" hpid="Mr. M. Brady Mr. M. Brady">

      <P>If one did not have much knowledge of the trade union movement &mdash; which I do having been a negotiator for the past 22 years &mdash; one could probably see some merits in this Bill, given the dispute in Ryanair which brought it about.  However, this Bill should be a last resort. Other recourse can be taken, such as sanctions on an employer like Ryanair, which has acted in a disgraceful manner that is not conducive to good industrial relations.  Dictatorship, discrimination and victimisation is the order of the day and that is not linked to Partnership 2000.  Ryanair cannot be allowed to spoil the party for everyone.</P>
      <P>I support the constitutional right of free association, particularly the right to form a trade union to protect the living standards of members and achieve acceptable conditions of employment. From the 1970s onwards trade unions, employers and workers rejected confrontational labour relations in favour of a voluntary approach.  The Celtic tiger is proof of the wisdom of that approach.  The Government, IBEC and the trade union movement must come together and work out what action needs to be taken.  Recognition will be the biggest threat to partnership in business. I spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, about this matter and a group is working vigorously on it.</P>
      <P>The voluntary code has worked well.  In 1996, 81 per cent of recommendations by the Labour Relations Commission were settled at conciliation stage.  Over 2,000 collective bargaining cases per annum were dealt with by the LRC and noncompulsory or voluntary settlements were issued. The chairperson of the Labour Court has confirmed it is keeping the matter of Ryanair under review and is prepared to facilitate the parties in any way.  I urge Ryanair, as Deputy Tom Kitt has, to take up the Labour Court's offer.  I am satisfied the Government will use its powers to contribute to the settlement of the Ryanair dispute.  We should not deal with the issue in the context of a localised dispute in an indigenous company, no matter how much we dislike the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade union movement has made an invaluable contribution to economic and social development, particularly under Partnership 2000.  The same cannot be said for employers as exploitation is widespread and &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; workers on low pay are common.  The development of social partnership is based on a long tradition <Col N="762" /> of free collective bargaining in the industrial relations area.  It is in this context that progress on trade union recognition is made.  As a trade union negotiator, I found the gun to the head approach seldom works.  An element of goodwill and trust is essential.</P>
    <P>This Bill will do the opposite and create a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation where &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; will become part of the language of industrial relations.  As a trade union activist, I will not support any move which will undermine the Labour Court and the LRC and create major difficulties for the trade union movement, which provides valuable assistance in the resolution of industrial relations disputes.</P>
    <P>The Bill is ill-timed and appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to a particular dispute.  It will seriously threaten the continuation of the voluntary social partnership which has contributed substantially to economic and social life and benefits all our citizens as well as future generations.  This Bill, if adopted, will plunge the trade union movement into turmoil.  I spoke to members of my trade union who believe we should hold fire and not be too hasty.  As Deputy Pat Carey and Deputy Jacob said, it is a broader issue which is not as simple as that.  We must encourage foreign investment and there must not be a perception that we cannot lift a pen or close a door without the involvement of a trade union.  The trade union movement is well aware of how multinationals operate.</P>
    <P>The members of my trade union are concerned about another issue which I have raised with the Minister and which we should debate.  Trade union members should have freedom of choice but in many cases they do not.  Many trade union members who, in some cases, subscribe 1 per cent of their basic salary or 1 per cent of their gross salary including overtime, are concerned that this money is transferred to a political party without their approval or consent.  Large donations were made by trade unions to a political party in the last general election without the consent of the trade union members.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas agus bród orm labhairt sa díospóireacht thábhachtach seo ar an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Irish labour movement, it gives me great pleasure to speak on the Bill.  The Trade Union Recognition Bill is comprehensive and prudent.  It was researched over many months by my colleague, Deputy Broughan, and presented to the House at a time when the issue of trade union recognition is at the heart of a serious industrial dispute at Ryanair.  The Bill is an important measure towards deepening social partnership.</P>
      <P>Social partnership will not continue in the long-term unless it is underpinned and deepened by industrial relations legislation to deal with a number of key issues facing workers in the trade union movement today.  While trade union recognition is one of these issues, it is by no means the only one.  Issues such as equality in the workplace, working hours, child care leave, low pay, the introduction of a minimum wage and Sunday trading are also of concern to our labour force and need to be addressed.  However, given the</P>
      <P>Government's head-in-the-sand attitude to the Trade Union Recognition Bill espoused by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, last night I hold out little hope of progress in these areas under the current Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Members believe social partnership has been achieved and that nothing more needs to be done to ensure its continued contribution to our economic well-being.  They could not be more wrong.  Social partnership has been a cornerstone of our economic success in recent years.  Since 1987 workers have had the discipline and foresight to agree to moderate pay increases and <Col N="764" /> changed work practices that have made our economy increasingly competitive and more attractive to indigenous and international commercial enterprises.  During the negotiations for Partnership 2000 workers and trade unionists made it abundantly clear that social partnership needed to be developed and deepened to ensure the continued support of the labour force.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Recognition Bill develops and deepens social partnership at a time when it is under great strain.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, and the rest of the Government are aware of the serious concerns of the trade union movement which have been expressed in the Ryanair dispute.  The behaviour of the airline's management is threatening the basis of our economic success and demands action from the Government as a matter of urgency.  The Government does not seem to understand the difference between actions and words.  Well meaning words by the Taoiseach will not resolve the current crisis.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, Deputy Broughan, has presented the Government with a golden opportunity to restore equilibrium to social partnership in the form of the Trade Union Recognition Bill, but the Government rejected it out of hand.  By its actions, the current Administration is contributing to the current unease.  The Government has chosen to deepen the crisis rather than take steps to resolve it.  That course of action &mdash; or, more accurately, inaction &mdash; is incomprehensible and inept.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Taoiseach's attitude to the Trade Union Recognition Bill, Brendan Hayes of SIPTU stated today that &ldquo;the future of partnership depends on the choice he makes&rdquo;.  We know the choice the Government and the Taoiseach have made and they must now face the serious consequences of the short-sighted rejection of the Bill.  How can the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste expect the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs to retain the confidence of the trade union movement after his rejection of this Bill and his humiliating and hypocritical rejection of another Bill introduced by Deputy Broughan to give statutory rights to workers in respect of Sunday trading.  Those actions send out the strong message that the continued development of social partnership is not a concern for the Government. It is a dangerous and worrying signal that has serious repercussions for industrial relations.  I am dismayed the Government does not appreciate the effect of its actions.  After the débacle involving credit unions, initiated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, it should come as no surprise that this Government does not care a whit for the concerns of ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>I will address some of the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.  When one looks beyond the invective and political point scoring in which he indulged, there was little substance to his speech.  In relation to the Ryanair dispute we yet again got fine words and no action from the Government.  The Minister of State stated &ldquo;For the Government's part, we will not hesitate to use <Col N="765" /> such powers as we have to contribute to the settlement of the dispute&rdquo;.  Does he not realise the Government has no powers to resolve this dispute?  When faced with a truculent and stubborn employer like Ryanair, the Government or the workers have no legislative recourse to action. Deputy Broughan's Bill would resolve this legislative lacuna.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State explain why, when presented with a Bill that would enable the Labour Court to impose a rational and measured solution to a long running and bitter industrial dispute, he rejects it?  Given the attitude of the Minister of State to this Bill, what alternative strategy does he intend to introduce to address our current legislative vacuum?</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State stated that trade union disputes were not &ldquo;a perpetual problem&rdquo;. He quoted figures regarding the number of such disputes that have appeared before the Labour Court in recent years to support his claim that trade union recognition is not a pressing issue.  He reported that at least 43 disputes involving trade union recognition were before the Labour Court in recent years and yet he still maintains the nonsense that this does not need legislative action. How many more workers does the Minister of State want on strike or engaged in other industrial action before he will give this matter the priority it deserves?  I am dismayed that a Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs can so lightly cast aside the serious issue of trade union recognition disputes.  It points to a Minister seriously out of touch with the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I also draw the Minister of State's attention to the statement issued today by Brendan Hayes of SIPTU who criticised him for misrepresenting the trade unions movement's position on the question of trade union recognition in his speech last night.  Mr. Hayes stated:</P>
    <P>SIPTU supports the terms and the spirit of the Trade Union Recognition Bill.  The Minister's claims to the contrary are quite simply wrong.</P>
    <P>We find it unacceptable that the Minister is rejecting the contents of the Bill and consider this action a betrayal of the spirit of Partnership. To present his stance as representative of the Trade Union movement's position is insulting but hardly surprising from a Minister who reneged on a promise to Retail Trade Workers to deal with the question of Sunday Trading.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most stinging rebukes of a Minister that I can recall from a senior trade unionist. It follows statements by Des Geraghty, SIPTU's vice president, regarding the future of Partnership 2000 after the carve-up the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevey, had the temerity to call a budget last December.  Let there be no doubt that the slashing of capital gains tax, the bias towards high income earners in the budget, the Finance Bill déba cle and the rejection of the <Col N="766" /> Trade Union Recognition Bill have established a serious stand-off between this Government and workers.  I am dismayed that the Government fails to recognise the damage it is doing and am equally disappointed action is not contemplated to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>This is a timely and comprehensive Bill.  It should be accepted by the Government as a progressive development in our industrial relations law.  That the Government has refused to do so represents a lost opportunity to give statutory recognition to the rights of workers to be represented by a trade union if they choose.  The Government's decision also places at risk the future of social partnership.  At the conclusion of this debate ordinary Irish workers will know of the Government's disregard for their concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this important debate.  Like Deputy O'Shea, I congratulate Deputy Broughan on the time and effort he has invested in this work.  This is not a knee-jerk reaction to a particular situation.  This matter has been of concern to trade unionists and workers for years and has come to a head because of the Ryanair déba cle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan has produced this legislation following the most extensive consultations with the social partners, including officials of SIPTU, and other trade unions.  He has also had group meetings with people to whom we are responsible. It is up to the Government to show some measure of generosity and accept the Bill.  Following the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, it appears the Government is set against the concept of what we are trying to do. From the contributions it is clear they have not taken the time to understand what Deputy Broughan is trying to do.  This is a softly softly approach and is not regressive or archaic given that some of the older workers in Dublin almost went on hunger strike for the right to be represented some 75 years ago.  I hope we are not returning to those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has always claimed to be an ardent supporter of one of the trade unions and their role in the economy.  I implore him to prove that his support for the trade union movement as a whole is genuine and not just lip service.  To date the Government has a poor track record with the trade union movement.  Hot on the heels of voting down his own Bill to regulate working hours for shop workers, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Kitt, the erstwhile friend of the trade union movement had the audacity to reject the Labour Party Bill introduced by Deputy Broughan.  In Opposition Fianna Fáil has always curried favour with the trade unions especially in the run up to general elections.  Indeed the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, was adept at turning up at every photocall organised by the trade union movement, by MANDATE, in particular, and getting plenty of publicity as a friend of the trade unions.  In Government the story is always somewhat <Col N="767" /> different with Fianna Fáil.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, is no longer considered the friend and ally of the trade unions.  He has betrayed and deceived the whole movement and it resents it strongly.  His mischievous misrepresentation of the Labour Party Bill has been condemned, and rightly so, by the country's biggest union, SIPTU.  I welcome the supportive comments of SIPTU's Brendan Hayes on the Labour Party Bill.  SIPTU has rejected the Minister's comments.  The union firmly believes the Government's response is a betrayal of the spirit of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The Government's first budget which was weighted heavily in favour of Partnership 2000, has placed it in jeopardy and the Government's behaviour on this Bill will put it under further strain.</P>
    <P>When the débâcle took place at Seagate everybody, including representatives of the Government, indicated that what happened there would not have happened if a consultative procedure had been available either through works councils or a trade union representative.  While I was in the House the Tánaiste spoke to representatives of the workers and said I was responsible for leaking information to the media at a time when I did not know about the closure.  I ask John Drennan and others who write about these matters without knowing anything about them to remember that in the meantime the Tánaiste has had the good grace to formally apologise to me for the inaccuracies in her statement that misled the workers.  The point is the Minister knew about the closure but did not tell the workers until their relatives had heard it on the radio while the workers were on their way to work.  It is not right to tell 1,400 workers overnight that their jobs are no longer available.  We do not want to force trade unions on anybody but when people join a trade union and want it to negotiate on their behalf, what is wrong with that in a free and open society where everyone is involved in trying to help one another?</P>
    <P>Some of the best employers are in my constituency. They insist on trade unions representing their workers and take subscriptions for them. When there is trouble on the shop floor they do not try to sort it out.  Instead, they telephone the trade union official and ask him to deal perhaps with a member who is creating problems.  In that way there is a spirit of partnership which is what the whole concept of trade unions is about.</P>
    <P>I refute another statement by a Fianna Fáil Deputy that trade unionists are forced to subscribe to political parties.  That is totally incorrect. Any trade unionist who does not want to subscribe to the Labour Party is given the opportunity to opt out.  It is not obligatory for anybody to contribute through the trade union movement to any political party.  I resent the inference that in some way we are forcing Fianna Fáil workers in trade unions to subscribe to the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil tried to get the whole trade union <Col N="768" /> movement to opt out but failed.  Even Fianna Fáil workers want to be represented by trade unions. That the Government wants to shy away from its responsibility will not excuse the Ryanair déba cle.  Why should workers, whose only offering to the employer is their labour, not be properly represented when they want to negotiate or discuss their terms of employment?  If the trade unions believe there is a danger to a company they are the first to confide in their workers and pull back from the precipice and play an active committed role as they have done through Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>This Bill only requires the setting up a procedure to be used in times of dispute.  The Minister gave fractions and percentages for various countries including America and France.  At least she recognised that workers in France had the legal right to be in works councils.  They did not have to be in a trade union because they had somebody who was prepared to negotiate for them.  That is what Ryanair workers want.  The Labour Court said it was available if the employers would use the procedure.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House because Deputy Rabbitte has a major contribution to make on behalf of his party.  We have been reasonable in the preparation of this Bill by way of consultation.  Those who have spoken from the Government side have indicated they had been representatives of trade unions for 25 years, that they have negotiated with their unions and had been in several unions.  This is all about people having the right to be in a union and for that union to be in a negotiating position with the employer.  What is wrong with that in 1998 when the whole trade union movement is such a vital part of Partnership 2000 which has contributed to the economic boom?</P>
    <P>Without stability and partnership the country would be in a poor state.  The Labour Party is proud of its relationship with the trade union movement and the contribution the trade union movement has made.  In suggesting that procedures should be laid down, complicated though they may be, no company should be frightened off.  We are not asking Ryanair management to agree &mdash; no employer automatically agrees to the demands of their workers &mdash; but to sit down and talk.  I compliment Deputy Broughan on his initiative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for allowing me to contribute and compliment Deputy Broughan and his party for provoking this timely debate.  This is a modest and balanced legislative effort to focus on a difficulty &mdash; this is not an exaggeration &mdash; that threatens the continuation of social partnership.  It is undisputed that companies have benefited hugely and disproportionately from a decade of social partnership. Workers have lived with moderate pay increases during that time, while unprecedented profits have been enjoyed by companies, their owners and directors.  If social partnership is to continue, <Col N="769" /> it cannot be a one-way street or about a pact at national level that generates pay restraint for workers and greater profits for companies and their managers.  Unless social partnership can be translated to the shop floor in a meaningful way, the concept will run out of steam.</P>
      <P>Active hostility to the desire of workers to be represented by the union of their choice is the most extreme threat to social partnership.  That is the reason the Ryanair dispute is so unfortunate and significant in that tens of thousands of trade unionists are watching the outcome.  This is a company on whose behalf the Government made partisan and decisive interventions to help it get off the ground.  Now that Ryanair is an immensely successful company, thanks to timely and partisan Government intervention as well as the workforce which has helped to build it up, it responds to the modest request for bargaining rights from a specific category of the workforce by denigrating their efforts and spurning the industrial relations machinery of the State.  Let us make no mistake: Ryanair is an old-fashioned, anti-union employer &mdash; an airborne Dunnes Stores.</P>
      <P>I am reliably advised that a decision has been taken at the most senior level in the company not just to resist recognition of SIPTU for baggage handlers but to contract out this service in the future.  This would be a viciously provocative act and would, if Ryanair proceeds with it, have negative implications far outside the company.  It would represent an escalation that would not be acceptable.  I challenge Mr. O'Leary to deny publicly that such a vindictive course of action has been decided.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, who has been ineffectual in this dispute to date, to intervene and leave Mr. O'Leary in no doubt that if he proceeds with this vindictive course of action, he will be resisted by the full weight of Government.</P>
      <P>Resort, for example, to the EU transfer of undertakings alone would not be sufficient in these circumstances.  This may require the Government amending certain sections of the 1990 Industrial Relations Act to permit solidarity action at Dublin Airport within normal democratic procedures without the unions involved being exposed or deprived of the usual immunities.</P>
      <P>Restiveness in the trade union movement is due primarily to two factors: the manner in which the 1990 Act has constrained normal trade union activity and the low level of trade union organisation in hi-tech international companies locating here.  The 1990 Act was a decisive intervention on the side of the employer in the delicately balanced dynamic that is the industrial relations process. It has had the effect that I predicted in this House in 1990 of removing much of the bargaining power of workers in an already uneven relationship with employers.  It will only serve to damage the industrial relations process and, ultimately, our country's reputation as a location for investment if the Ryanair example in exploiting the 1990 Act is to be followed elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> The old style, anti-union character of Ryanair is not directly comparable with certain international companies locating here from a nonunion environment and culture.  Usually, these companies put considerable investment into their human resources policies and deliberately contrive to pay the going rate or better.  The great challenge of the new century for the trade union movement is whether it can enhance its appeal to the new worker in these hi-tech companies.</P>
    <P>Companies enjoying buoyant profits must recognise that they must provide for fuller participation by their workers if social partnership is to prevail.  Trade unions, for their part, must appreciate that many of the new workers are not demanding that the law be used as a recruiting sergeant to keep trade union numbers up.  The Bill does not propose that and the Minister of State is wrong in seeking to leave that impression. The trade union movement, as instanced by its response to the report of the high level group, does not demand that.  It expects no more than that the voluntarist character of industrial relations be protected by reasonable legislation, if necessary.  The trade unions have no vested interest in frightening away foreign investment. The Congress paper makes that clear.  If the Bill proceeds to Committee Stage, as I sincerely hope it will, there are certain amendments that I would like to bring forward on behalf of my party.</P>
    <P>I regret that elements of the then leadership of the trade unions forced Congress in 1990 to acquiesce on certain sections of the 1990 Bill which were, plainly, not in the interests of the trade union movement.  It is now reaping the whirlwind of that acquiescence and the majority of reasonable employers, as Deputy Ferris said, would make common cause with trade union leaders that it is in the interests of neither to destabalise the delicately balanced dynamic that is the industrial relations process.  Deputy Gilmore and I made that clear at the time but, unfortunately, it was not until the subsequent year's conference that our objections were espoused by the wider trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I regret, although I am not surprised, that the Minister of State has indicated, on behalf of the Government, that he intends to vote down the Bill.  He has taken no effective action since the dispute at Ryanair began despite the fact that the company has spurned the industrial relations machinery of the State.  Deputy Broughan has brought forward the Bill to provoke this timely debate on the wider issues which, indisputably, surround the Ryanair dispute.  If the management of Ryanair continues along the path it has chosen, it will have implications far outside the company and Dublin Airport.  A great many other employers who have benefited from social partnership during the past decade will live to rue the day.  It is extremely regrettable that this is the Government's response.  I ask it to think again and allow Deputy Broughan's measure to proceed to Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I will not do that.  Disputes on union recognition can be nasty and can give rise to major problems.  That has been the case in the past and will be the case in the future.  Legislation might seem to be a quick-fix solution, but it is not the recommended course for dealing with such disputes.  I know from my previous employment <Col N="772" /> that some union recognition disputes were almost exclusively about inter-union disputes, which can lead to a much nastier and bigger problem.  I note the provisions of the Bill will not extend to inter-union disputes or to workers who are already represented by a union, but life is not that simple.  A solution may be provided in law, which might or might not be, as in the case of Ryanair dispute, geared towards solving a dispute.  If this legislation was enacted and viewed by employers and others to be the solution the Labour Party and others claim it would be, what would happen in the case of inter-union disputes or union recognition disputes at the bottom of which lies a trade union, usually a maverick trade union, not covered by the ICTU?  There is talk about the Labour Court having rights and a quasi-judicial role where its findings would be binding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are quite a number outside. I am sure from his previous experience the Deputy would know of and have dealt with many such disputes.  When I was involved in the trade union movement it was always interested in the Labour Court, but it absolutely refused to accept any third party labour relations commission or the Labour Court could issue a finding that would be binding.  If the Labour Party is saying it has talked this out in detail with the unions, has it looked beyond the short-term quick-fix solution to the problem in Ryanair?  Has it considered how that matter might develop?  Is the Labour Party saying the ICTU and the general trade union movement are now in favour of findings issued by the Labour Court or some other agency being binding?  That is an interesting point.  If that is the case, people will view these matters in a different light, but I do not believe that is the position. Trade unions have always zealously guarded their right to refer a matter to the Labour Court for its consideration and then to accept or reject its finding depending on the mood of its members at that time.</P>
      <P>The Bill was not cobbled together in a week because it appears Deputy Broughan has done some work on it, but it has been introduced to cash in on the emotive atmosphere surrounding the Ryanair dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Many documents are drafted and left on the top shelf; it is a case of when they are taken off it because timing is everything.  This Bill might be seen to be a simplistic solution to the problem.  I know a major issue has arisen because of the Ryanair dispute although there is a good deal of politically correct talk about it because it is an issue in Dublin North where there is a forthcoming by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="773" /> I hold no brief for any private company whose chief executive earns £17 million.  That figure is obscene and workers in such an organisation must find it very difficult to motivate themselves to do an honest day's work.  Neither do I hold much truck with trade union officials who might earn salaries of up to £100,000.  Membership figures were mentioned earlier.  There has been a decline in trade union membership throughout the country.  If some trade union officials were paid on a bonus system, they would not earn some of the exalted salaries they are reported to earn.</P>
    <P>I am mainly concerned about the members, the workers.  There are different battles going on and sometimes workers are used and abused by management who are fighting for their livelihoods and their recruitment campaigns.  Sometimes workers are also used and abused by trade union officials.  That applies in the case of a dispute involving the employer looking for union recognition and, having regard to some of the inter-union recognition disputes in which I have been involved, it was very much a case of unions and union officials fighting for their patch, to keep up their numbers and not being so concerned about their members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing to do with this Bill.  The Deputy has not read it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I read it.  The trade union movement was necessary and relevant in the past and still is today, but of course that depends on the employer.  The fight for trade union membership and survival must go on and unions, like every other organisation, must adjust and make themselves more meaningful and relevant.  They have done that and co-operated fully in the drive towards social partnership in recent years.  In many union disputes, including Ryanair, much of the problem arises because the union involved is a maverick union and not affiliated ICTU.  I understand the employer in the Ryanair case falls into the same category.  It is a maverick employer. It is not a member of IBEC.  The ICTU has difficulty trying to build bridges to get some of its wild men to come on board and the same applies to the business world.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan did not spell matters out in his Bill.  An old colleague of ours when talking about politics used to say it was a numbers game. If an employee is demanding trade union recognition from his or her employer, the same game applies.  People might ask whether 30 employees out of 900 justify trade union recognition?  The Deputy has not spelt out the numbers required.  I am not giving my deep thoughts on this but neither has the Deputy given his.  The answer to that is not simple because 30 out of 900 or 30 out of 50 might want trade union recognition.  One could take that to ridiculous lengths and ask whether three out of five employees in a specialist grade suffice for trade union recognition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that Ryanair has adopted such <Col N="774" /> a tone in the present dispute and that it did not accept the invitation made by the Labour Court. Ryanair is a good company and has done a good deal to build up our aviation industry in recent years.  It has contributed greatly to the growth of tourism in the Dublin area.  Maybe we are all victims of our environment and conditioning.  It keeps referring to SIPTU as the Aer Lingus union and while Ryanair is now a big company perhaps it found it difficult to compete with its big brother over the years.  They may be living in their own little time warp based on the hassle they had over the last ten years.</P>

      <P>Of course I do.  I sincerely hope they will come on board and act in the spirit of social partnership, which has been fostered by all Governments for the past ten years.  Listening to earlier Opposition speakers, one would think that this Government had nothing to do with developing and fostering social partnership over the past ten or 11 years.</P>

      <P>Some of the comments were unfair.  I accept that all Governments in those years helped to develop, build and keep the social partnership going.  There is a difficulty, however. There has been a lot of Ryanair bashing and perhaps most of it has been well deserved.  I wish they would do the decent thing for their own good as well as for everybody else's and sit down and talk to the people concerned.  That is the only sensible way forward.</P>
      <P>The Bill would bring in words like &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; and &ldquo;coercion&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>No. All those things are binding agreements which go to the heart of trade union disputes.  The Deputy is putting forward a scenario which is grand from one perspective, but if it was accepted it would cause major hassle in the trade union movement.  If they have changed their views they should come forward and say they are prepared to accept a world where there are binding agreements.  I am sure IBEC and Ryanair would look on life in a totally different way if that was the situation.  There are some good ideas in the Deputy's Bill, but it is the easy, quick fix solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House is a knee jerk reaction to the Ryanair dispute.  It <Col N="775" /> ignores the real position on the ground where there is positive co-operation between the trade union movement and employers.  The overall employee-employer relationship, as reflected daily in the Partnership 2000 agreement, is a positive one.  The new position on all sides involving a proactive approach towards a partnership with shared vision runs contrary to the position taken by Ryanair.</P>
      <P>I commend the trade union movement and employers alike for their positive contribution towards economic development.  We all share in the success we collectively created.  Given this stated position, it is wrong to introduce a Bill which seeks to reintroduce the language of coercion and mandatory sanctions to industrial relations.</P>
      <P>The position expounded in the Bill is outdated and has no place in a modern developing economy. The obvious points of difference in the Bill relate to the degree of erosion of the principles of free collective bargaining and the voluntarism that underpins industrial relations today.</P>
      <P>In recent years there has been a significant strengthening of the laws governing industrial relations.  In a dispute, when the industrial relations machinery is used to its full the outcome is usually positive and serves both sides of the argument.  There is a consensus of support for the present position.  Any legislation covering trade union involvement must take note of the voluntary position of membership.  There are companies and commercial activities that are not unionised because that is the wish of the workforce. Most progressive, non-unionised companies have a strong employee-employer management structure, which gives them the edge in the market place.  This type of position must always be recognised. In fact, this structure is almost modelled on the trade union ethos itself.</P>
      <P>Overseas investment is critical to the future development of our economy.  Future growth plans lay a heavy emphasis on attracting overseas investment.  One of the many attractions of Ireland for foreign investors is the voluntary nature of our trade union and industrial relations structure.  As this is a successful formula we should not tamper with it by way of new legislation of the kind proposed by Deputy Broughan. Rather, we should strengthen what we have in a positive way in the interests of all concerned.  This would give a clear signal to outside investors that we have a formula for success and that we understand the needs of employees and employers alike &mdash; the civilised point of view.  As regards the Ryanair situation, in this context it is fair to say that one swallow never made a summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Union density is growing in multinational corporations. It may be a slow procedure, but the economic situation does not demand a frenetic pace.  We should also consider legislation in other jurisdictions.  We must not create a situation that gives any other country a favourable position in <Col N="776" /> the market place because of our trade union and industrial relations legislation.</P>
    <P>A relevant consideration regarding the impact of any possible change in the framework for trade union recognition is the likelihood of changes in relation to recognition in the UK, for example. This, and the more general topic of international practice in relation to dispute recognition and resolution, were considered by the high level group mentioned earlier.  It remains to be seen what changes may occur in the UK.  It was in this context that the group examined the experience in the 1970s in the UK, the USA, Canada and Australia. Complex procedures for ballots to establish membership levels, for example, were a feature of these systems.  It was noted in the Canadian model that recourse to ballots was minimised with a view to avoiding potentially divisive campaigns which could damage the climate for subsequent employer-union negotiations.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made by a number of unions that State agencies, such as the IDA, should pay grants or subsidies in relation to the location of greenfield sites for companies that are prepared to recognise trade unions.  I do not believe, and I do not think the Government believes, that this is the way forward.  I presume it is something the IDA would be against.  Setting any such preconditions would, in effect, severely handicap agencies like the IDA in its efforts to secure overseas investment in the face of competition from development agencies elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that mandatory trade union recognition and changed policies that are perceived as mandatory would have a substantially adverse impact upon inward investment and future employment opportunities.  In particular, the mandatory recognition policy would have consequences in relation to this country's primary standing in such niche markets as electronics.  All this must be borne in mind in relation to any legislation that the House might consider or pass in future.  A Bill of this nature needs a far more in depth study of the possible consequences, at home and abroad, of its implementation.</P>
    <P>Many new overseas companies choose not to recognise trade unions.  If they take that position, the way to tackle the problem is not to introduce policies to legislate in this regard, but to encourage the trade union movement to work with the incoming overseas investor or indigenous investors. They should encourage the development of a trade union system within.  The partnership that would grow from that discussion would strengthen the company and the trade union far more than any action we might take in this House.  With regard to trade unions, it comes down to personal relationships, building a company, helping to manage and assist it, and adopting a unique individual approach to each company. In that way a conclusion can be reached by way of agreement.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of confrontation with management is built into this legislation, along with language that is no longer recognised in the modern <Col N="777" /> industrial relations scene.  The proposals in the Bill will lead to legal changes and changes in the way the institutions work.  It will have a profound effect.  The highly legislative and adversarial procedure proposed will pose not only operational difficulties for the Labour Court but also will impart a new character to those bodies.  Their strength is in their autonomy and their flexibility and they work well at present.</P>
    <P>All this leads to the point about support for the Bill.  As a former member of a trade union and now as an employer dealing with the situation, I cannot support this Bill.  My experience has been, as has been the experience of many small businesses, that the best way forward is in co-operation with the trade union, by way of a voluntary discussion with it and an understanding of where the company is going.  Regardless of whether the trade union is big or small, it interacts with the company in a positive way.  It can have a positive effect on the overall development of that company. Surely that is the way we should go and we should constantly reiterate that point.  From both sides of the fence, I see the situation as it has developed in terms of Partnership 2000 as the only way forward.  This Bill does not recognise the positive work of previous Administrations and Ministers, of the trade union movement and of some of its individual members, not to speak of the positive contribution to the overall movement by employers.  I support the Government's position on this Bill.</P>

It was left to people like Larkin who organised strikes in difficult situations: a Dublin of 305,000 people which dealt in commercial distribution and shipping, where people earned 15 shillings a week and where conditions were dreadful. It was left to the Irish Women Workers' Union, under Delia Larkin, who managed to grow her union from 1,000 to 60,000 members&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Having reached a situation where employers and employees can work together &mdash; it was not that long ago the employers were on the opposite side of the fence &mdash; it would be a pity to introduce the level of coercion I see in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We should also take cognisance of the Constitution which grants freedom of association under Article 40.6.1. It is a freedom which allows people to join or not to join a union or for people to recognise a union.  It has been recognised by numerous cases in the courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is not something which we, the Legislature, can afford to ignore.  It is worth quoting one of the early cases:</P>
      <P>I do not see that a trade union stands at present on a different footing from any other voluntary organisation as regards the free choice of new members.</P>
      <P>Members have the choice to join or not to join. For example, in the case of the Educational Company of Ireland <i>v</i> Fitzpatrick, the plaintiff had been subjected to picketing by a number of its employees who were members of a trade union to force other employees who were not members to join.  Notice the word &ldquo;force&rdquo;, something we are witnessing in this Bill.  The plaintiff successfully brought their case.  Mr. Justice Budd said:</P>
      <P>I hold.that under the Constitution a citizen is free to join or not to join an association or union as he pleases.  Further, that he cannot be deprived of the right to join or not to join such association or union as he pleases.  . That is tantamount to saying that he may not be compelled to join any association or union against his will.  Those are the type of words we see again in this Bill which speaks of compulsion.</P>

      <P>This Bill forces an employer to recognise unions, something which has already been dealt with by the courts which said an employer is not bound to negotiate with any specific union.  The right of association of employees does not imply any duty on the employer beyond respecting that right in itself and discharging his side of any agreement with employees.  This has been proven in various cases.  There is no obligation on anyone to recognise the associations or unions.  It is important in the spirit of consultation, partnership and agreement that we keep in mind laws which have been passed previously, the development of unions over the past century and the interpretation of different cases by the courts.  Everything we in this House do is based on ultimate agreement.  Everything in the workplace is based on consensus and agreement so as to gain progress.  There cannot be progress if we force a situation where people must do something.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies will be aware that the US multinational, Monsanto, plans to carry out experimental planting of genetically engineered sugar beet at ten sites throughout Ireland.  Last year they carried out one field trial and, through the very courageous work of Genetic Concern, a judicial review was granted.  At the granting of that judicial review Mr. Justice O'Sullivan said that there was a substantial case to be answered.  It seems that the first full debate on this very important subject will take place not in this House, not in public, but in the High Court.</P>
      <P>As of yesterday, the number of objections received by the EPA numbered 2,500, roughly ten times the number of objections received in total last year.  Why are the public so concerned? Why are people objecting so strenuously to this? More important, why are the public not being encouraged by politicians to openly debate this very important issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be that this so-called project is seen as being of benefit to farmers.  I ask farmers whether they are aware that in the USA farmers must sign a contract obliging them to pay Monsanto a technology fee, as well as a premium price for the seed.  The farmer then must use Monsanto's brand of weedkiller and is forbidden to save seed for future crops.  This is the real reason behind genetic engineering.  It is about profit, and profit should not be the concern of this House.  We should be concerned about the potential danger that genetic engineering presents, not just for the environment, not just to health, but to the future <Col N="781" /> of Irish agriculture which has a fantastic reputation as a producer of natural clean food.</P>
    <P>I am not a Luddite.  I favour scientific and technological advancement.  I received a telephone call today from the <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> which led me to believe I have a reputation as a technology wizard &mdash; I am not sure if that is deserved. However, in terms of scientific advancement, I believe we have to advance cautiously and responsibly.  In this case we are not doing that. We are talking here about the very essence of life.</P>
    <P>The sugar beet about which we speak has had a combination of 11 different genes from two bacteria, three viruses and two plants spliced in to make the plant resistant to Roundup, a systemic weedkiller that normally kills all weeds.  Have we forgotten about the problems associated with CFCs where again big multinational companies, DuPont and ICI, promoted these products as safe, and we now read, even today, of the huge problems associated with skin cancers because of the depletion of the ozone layer.  Have we forgotten about the problems associated with the nuclear industry?  Again many of us, when we were going to school, were told categorically that this was a safe industry.  Many people in this House were enthusiasts and wanted nuclear power here.  Some of us, who were regarded as mavericks and cranks, objected to that at Carnsore.  Have we forgotten about BSE and the real problems that has caused for Irish agriculture? It seems that scientific certainty can go awry at times, and unfortunately we have forgotten that.</P>
    <P>Monsanto will describe this as a very precise technology, and yet thousands of members of the Union of Concerned Scientists say that genetic engineering of food and agriculture must be banned, at least until we fully understand the function of all the genes in modified organisms. Monsanto do not have a great reputation for telling the truth, and there are many instances where they have altered information to suit their own purposes, particularly in relation to dioxin.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil campaigned in the general election, it said clearly that Fianna Fáil would not support what amounts to the largest nutritional experiment in human history, with the consumer as guinea pig.  It said that current scientific knowledge was inadequate to protect the consumer and the environment from the unpredictable and potentially disastrous effects which may appear immediately or at any time in the future.  The Minister who said that, Deputy Dempsey, must be himself genetically engineered, because no ordinary human being could be so cynical and so irresponsible.  We must debate this issue, and we must debate it quickly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Gormley for raising this item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas of genetic engineering for which the Department is responsible relate to the contained use and deliberate release of genetically modified <Col N="782" /> organisms.  At EU level, these activities are controlled under Directives 90/21 9/EEC and 90/220/EEC.  The competent authority provisions of this directive are transposed into national law under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994 and the Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority for the purposes of the regulations and the directives.</P>
    <P>The multiple application to which the Deputy referred relates to two notifications which have been submitted to the EPA for consent to undertake controlled experimental releases of two genetically modified sugar beet plants on a number of sites around the country.  Experimental releases of genetically modified plants are generally carried out for research purposes and, in the case of crop plants, they do not involve the use of the trial crop for human consumption or animal feed purposes.  Separate prior consent is required for placing genetically modified products on the EU market; under the deliberate release directive 90/220/EEC in the case of animal feeds and under EU Regulation 258/97, concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients, in the case of food products.</P>
    <P>The prior notification and consent provisions of directive 90/220/EEC related to experimental releases of genetically modified organisms for research purposes have been fully transposed into national law under the 1994 regulations.  Our legislative control procedures are fully in line with EU law and they are being fully implemented by the EPA as national competent authority.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the EPA to process and determine the two sugar beet notifications in accordance with the provisions of the 1994 regulations and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the merits of the specific case.  In fact, under section 79(3) of the EPA Act, 1992, the Minister is precluded from seeking to exercise any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by the agency of a function assigned to it by or under the Act.</P>
    <P>My colleague Minister Dempsey and I are fully committed to a precautionary approach in this whole area and to the fundamental objective, as expressed in the deliberate release directive, of protecting human health and the environment. The directive, and the regulations which transpose it into national law, already reflect such an approach in providing a mandatory requirement on users to obtain prior written consent, based on a comprehensive environmental risk assessment and evaluation, before any deliberate releases of genetically modified organisms into the environment may be carried out.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of a proposal from the European Commission to bring forward an amendment of the deliberate release directive, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has indicated his intention to have a national debate on the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.  A draft paper on <Col N="783" /> a national policy position is being prepared in the Department and will be made widely available as part of a widespread consultation with the public and the biotechnology industry in the country. The views expressed by Deputy Gormley will be taken into consideration in drafting the policy paper.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important and pressing matter.  On Tuesday, 16 December I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance asking the proposals, if any, he had to refurbish and make safe the ruined church at Faithlegg, County Waterford. His reply indicated that this was a matter for his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The reply went on to state that the ruined church was not in State ownership or guardianship and that, consequently, carrying out works there was not a matter for the national monuments and historic properties service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>I then tabled a question to the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in which I asked her to take the ruined church at Faithlegg into State ownership or guardianship and to carry out the necessary refurbishment in view of the historical importance of the church as well as the safety of the public.  The Minister replied that recognition and legal protection had been afforded to the ruins of the church and the adjoining graveyard pursuant to the provisions of section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, and, as a consequence, any person proposing to carry out any work at or in relation to the monument must give notice of such intention and shall not commence the work for a period of two months after having given such notice.  She went on to say that having regard to the current extensive level of commitments in the region in question, Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department, was unable to take the ruined church at Faithlegg into State care and that when resources permitted the matter would be carefully reconsidered.</P>
      <P>Her response was totally unsatisfactory and inadequate.  Apart from the historical and architectural importance of the ruined church, there is considerable concern regarding its safety given that it is situated adjacent to the Catholic church and within the local graveyard.  Brother Laurence O'Toole described it as a well preserved ruin of a good sized architecturally satisfying old church, side by side with the parish church.  All the evidence points to the late 14th and early 15th century as the date of construction of the ruined church.  It is, therefore, pre-Reformation and would have been used for Catholic worship right up to the time of Cromwellian forfeiture of the Faithlegg property.  After this it gradually fell into ruin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> The ruined Faithlegg church has been described by the Office of Public Works as follows:</P>
    <P>The building warrants preservation and a conservation project should be undertaken before deterioration and masonry collapse, especially in the sacristy, make the task all the more difficult and expensive.  Initially the structure should be liberally sprayed with a weed killer solution to kill the vegetation and the vegetation allowed to decay before removal so as not to destroy masonry.</P>
    <P>The ivy has been removed from the ruin and it has been put strongly to me that this has caused the ruin to become unsafe.  I put it to the Minister in the strongest terms that her decision to stand idly by in relation to this important national monument is not good enough from a safety or heritage point of view.  She must take responsibility for the matter and have the necessary works carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's question on 28 January I referred to the many commitments of Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, regarding the maintenance and conservation of national monuments within the south-eastern and southern national monument regions.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to give details of some of the more significant commitments of the service.</P>
      <P>Under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, funding has been provided for a number of projects in the regions.  Work is under way on projects at Roscrea Castle, County Tipperary, Tintern Abbey, County Wexford, which will be opened this summer, the Rock of Dunamase, County Laois, Gowran Church, County Kilkenny, and the mainguard, Clonmel, County Tipperary.  Further EU and Exchequer funds have been committed to projects at Dungarvan Castle, County Waterford and Charlesfort in Kinsale.  It is expected that work on these projects will commence in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This work often involves an archaeological excavation of the site, followed by conservation works, presentation of the site and the provision of access to the public.  When appropriate, restoration or partial restoration of the monument is undertaken.  The integration of a visitor facility at the monument site, including an exhibition-display area, guide service, tea rooms and toilets, is undertaken at some sites.  A fine example of such work is the project currently under way at Tintern Abbey.  Following excavation, conservation of the cloister was undertaken.  Conservation and partial restoration of the old coach buildings to provide a visitor facility is currently in progress.  The conservation and restoration work being undertaken to the castle, round tower and friary in Roscrea <Col N="785" /> is another testimony to the success of these projects.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, such projects require, by their nature, to be methodically and painstakingly undertaken to do justice to the archaeological, historical and architectural significance of the monuments.  They require a high degree of skilled workmanship and consequently take a longer time to complete.  In order that maximum benefit is derived from the EU-Exchequer funds which have been allocated under the operational programme for tourism, it is essential that priority be given to the completion of projects which are so funded.  Funding for these projects expires in 1999 and it is expected that the work will continue at least until the end of that year.  In addition to the extensive programme of works funded under the operational programme, Dúchas has responsibility for the conservation and maintenance of approximately 150 national monuments in the two regions.  Extensive conservation works require to be carried out at a number of sites.</P>
    <P>I accept that Faithlegg church is of architectural and historical significance.  The monument is in good structural condition, although conservation work will be required.  However, given the resource constraints which I have outlined, I am unable at present to take the church into State care.  The heritage service of my Department is prepared to give advice to a local organisation which is prepared to carry out the work required to ensure its preservation.  I strongly recommend this course of action as it will be a number of years before the service is in a position to undertake the work.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter which relates to a couple who are getting on in years and should be able to enjoy the autumn of their lives.</P>
      <P>Although this couple reside in Dublin 12 during the week they own a home in the south east where they spend a considerable amount of time. A lot of the harassment is centred on their country home and through telephone calls to their home in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I first raised this matter early last year with the Garda authorities and I received an acknowledgement. These people received a threat that damage would be caused to their country home and this threat was fulfilled.  There was damage to the exterior of the home and to plants.  The threats continued and the perpetrator got bolder and started ringing the couple at home.  This was extremely upsetting for the couple who have done nothing to deserve this treatment.  Of late the perpetrator has not only taken to telephoning them, and they have a recording of his voice on their answering machine, he has started to write to them to taunt them about his deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again raised this with the Garda and was informed that there was an ongoing investigation. <Col N="786" /> I received a similar response when I raised the matter in a parliamentary question.  Almost a year later, I again raised it in a parliamentary question and was told that the investigation was ongoing.  My constituents, who were hard working and should be enjoying their retirement, are at the end of their tether.  They are extremely upset because of the harassment they are receiving.</P>
    <P>The gardaí in Dublin 12 have been very helpful. However, the problem is not just in Dublin 12 but also in the south east and the area from where the telephone calls are sourced.  This requires a co-ordinated approach.  I do not raise such matters lightly in the Dáil.  I handle a huge amount of constituency work each week and I rarely raise individual matters concerning the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  However, I feel obliged to raise this matter. I have raised it with the gardaí and with the Minister and the situation is going from bad to worse.  I hope that the Minister of State is in a position to give some hope that Garda inquiries are progressing and that some relief is in sight for this couple so that the perpetrator of this harassment can be prevented from carrying out this heinous activity.  It would be very upsetting for any of us, but is most upsetting for people who are at a time of their lives when they should be relaxing.</P>

His answer concluded by stating that the gardaí would continue to liaise with the persons concerned to apprise them of the position in relation to the investigation.</P>
      <P>In his response to another parliamentary question by the Deputy in January last, the Minister said that he had been informed by the Garda authorities that recent complaints received in the matter are also being investigated and receiving appropriate Garda attention.</P>
      <P>Following notice of the Deputy's intention to raise this matter on the Adjournment, the Minister requested a further report from the gardaí. They subsequently informed him that the investigation in question is continuing.  The Minister readily appreciates the concern expressed by the Deputy on behalf of the persons concerned for whom these incidents are obviously a distressing matter.  However, as the Deputy will understand, the appropriate authority for investigating the source or sources of these distasteful incidents is the Garda Síochána.  It would not be appropriate for the Minister to go into any specific details of what is, essentially, a Garda operational matter but he will ask the Garda authorities to ensure that they keep the injured parties informed of progress in their investigations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a survey of schools in County Sligo, high levels of radon gas have been found in the west.  As a result, the Department of Education and Science offered free radon testing to schools in the county.  However, this was at the discretion of school principals and, unfortunately, not all schools were tested.</P>
      <P>The parents' committee became concerned about this matter when they discovered that remedial work had not been carried out in the schools.  They found it difficult to gather information on what was happening and how their children might be affected.  This was how the idea of a survey came about.</P>
      <P>Following testing, the Department of Education and Science recommended that remedial work should be carried out in all schools with radon levels above 150 becquerels per cubic metre.  This work was carried out in 25 schools. The work involved the laying of pipes under the floors of rooms carrying high levels of radon. These pipes were connected to pumps fitted on an external wall.  The pumps extract the gas from under the building where it gathers.  In schools where remedial work was recommended, the Department contracted companies to carry out the work.  The Department funded 85 per cent of the work and the balance was funded by the schools.  The survey uncovered some interesting facts.</P>
      <P>What has happened since the remedial work began in the schools in 1993-4?  The Department recommended that remedial work be carried out in all cases where radon levels were above the set limit of 150 becquerels per cubic metre.  No detailed specifications were supplied to the boards of management, teachers or parents regarding the detection equipment.  What is now recommended is that the Department should ensure that this vital information is made available to schools since the health of children and teachers should be of primary concern.</P>
      <P>The second finding was that no maintenance was carried out on the radon extraction equipment supplied.  The survey also showed that schools were unaware if the pumps were working. It is recommended that a planned programme of maintenance checks carried out by suitably qualified personnel must be put in place by the Department of Education and Science as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Some schools are switching off the extraction pumps during holidays and the research indicates that a build up of radon is virtually guaranteed within the classrooms when the pumps are switched off.  It is recommended that the Department should issue an immediate instruction to all schools not to switch off the radon extraction pumps and that it should consider aiding the running costs of the pumps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The survey also discovered that information on radon in schools was difficult to obtain &mdash; it is not held in any one location.  The Department of <Col N="788" /> Education and Science, the Office of Public Works and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland had all to be contacted.  It is recommended that the Department should co-ordinate information from the different areas.  This could keep all those involved in education fully informed on the up-to-date research.  There should be an internet site with this information. Such a site would provide information to the public while allowing teachers to use the internet to educate children about radon and its effects.</P>
    <P>The highest level of radon found in any school was 1,363 bqms &mdash; ten times above the agreed level.  The lowest level was 26 bqms.  The Department recommends remedial work in 25 schools. One school with the highest level of radon had no remedial work carried out to date.  The bulk of remedial work was carried out during 1993-94 and the average cost was £600 per classroom.  In addition, a number of schools turned the pumps off during the school holidays, which is of major concern.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent of all schools that had bad remedial work carried out have had no further testing done to ascertain if the work was successful and the radon concentrates reduced to safe levels.  Very few principals could tell the level of radon in their schools.  More than two thirds were unable to give the results of the radon testing.  Three schools found that their pumps were not working and had to be replaced.  This is a serious issue and the Minister should give the necessary instructions.  I appreciate the huge contribution of the Department to the installation of the pumps.  It is important that there is ongoing supervision of maintenance, that information is made available and that the teacher concerned is fully aware of how to access the information to assure parents that the level of radon in County Sligo schools is safe.</P>
    <P>A survey was carried out in 25 schools in County Sligo.  I appeal to the Minister to carry out a complete check of all schools in the county.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this grave issue which is of concern to me.  I was particularly concerned when I received the results of the survey and I thank the Sligo committee of the National Parents Council, Primary, for its initiative in carrying out the survey regarding radon gas levels in local national schools.  By doing so the council has provided an important service to the community.  The morning after the publication of the results I was in touch with the chairperson of the committee to go through it in detail and I received a copy of the report that morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, has been conducting a national survey of domestic radon concentrations since 1989.  It has conducted selected surveys in a number of counties, including Sligo.  The first report of the national survey was published in October 1996 and covered Counties Cavan, Dublin, Louth, <Col N="789" /> Monaghan and Wicklow.  It is anticipated that by the summer of 1999 reports will be available on every county.</P>
    <P>My Department relies on the published results of the national radon survey of the Radiological Protection Institute in identifying high risk radon areas.  If a new school is being built in these areas, radon remediation measures are included in the plans even though the building regulations concerning radon gas do not strictly apply to schools &mdash; they only apply to domestic dwellings and long stay residential buildings.  However, for the sake of the well-being of pupils and staff, my Department applies the remediation measures to new schools in these areas.</P>
    <P>Radon first became an issue for schools after the RPII conducted its first radon studies in western Ireland in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Following tests in 1992 radon remediation work was recommended in 25 primary schools and ten secondary schools in County Sligo.  This work was undertaken in 1994.  After works were executed, the post-remediation radon level was monitored to ensure that the work was done properly.  To ensure the equipment is working properly, post-remediation radon levels would require to be measured regularly and equipment replaced and repaired as necessary.  Regarding equipment installed some years ago in certain schools in County Sligo, I am concerned by reports that it was not being maintained or not being used correctly. I have asked my officials to contact the schools to which radon testing and remediation equipment was provided with a view to developing a planned programme of information and maintenance for the equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> My Department will contact the Radiological Protection Institute to identify regions with high radon levels.  Arrangements will be made for surveys to be carried out to determine the radon concentration levels in schools in these areas.  I have discussed this arrangement with the chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute. I have asked the Department to consult the RPII and the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the preparation of an information leaflet on radon gas which will be sent to all schools.  This will outline preliminary measures schools should take in dealing with radon gas.</P>
    <P>We will send information to all schools reiterating that under no circumstances should pumps be switched off during holiday breaks or at weekends. There can be a very significant build up of gas when pumps are turned off.</P>
    <P>I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion regarding the utilisation of our Department's website for the dissemination of information on radon.  Boards of management also have some responsibility and there should be more regular contact between them and the Department on this issue.  There seems to have been a breakdown in communication between all concerned parties in terms of the operation of the pumps and their ongoing regular monitoring and testing.  We will now take a proactive stance on this matter to ensure that, in collaboration with boards of management, our planned maintenance and information programmes are put in place.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 19 February 1998.</P>

      <Quest>the implications, if any, of the changeover to the ILO-based standardised unemployment rate method of calculating unemployment statistics; his views on whether he expects the gap with the live register to be clearly identified from April 1998.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4102/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>In December, the Government announced the planned changeover to an improved ILO-based presentation of statistics on employment and unemployment.  The new form of presentation was proposed by the Central Statistics Office, endorsed by the strategy group on employment and unemployment and followed from recommendations made last May by the National Economic and Social Forum in its report on unemployment statistics.</P>
      <P>The new presentation will give greater prominence to the ILO-based measures of employment and unemployment, which have been included in the CSO's annual labour force survey reports since 1988.  The ILO-based figures are the ones normally used by international agencies for inter-country comparisons.  They provide a very detailed and objective classification of persons by labour force status from which a range of summary indicators can also be derived.  The traditional national labour force measures, based on the person's subjective assessment of the situation, will continue to be published.</P>
      <P>The key measure of unemployment is the standardised unemployment rate, which the CSO has published since 1992.  In addition, five other ancillary indicators will now be published to give supporting information relating to long-term unemployment, persons marginally attached to the labour force and jobless households.</P>
      <P>The changeover will be linked to the publication, planned for April, of the first results from the quarterly national household survey.  This survey will be the definitive source of comprehensive sub-annual information on employment and unemployment.  The availability of more frequent survey-based information, including the ancillary indicators, will, in conjunction with the monthly live register and other data sources, improve the overall range of statistics available on the labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> The CSO's monthly main live register statement includes data on those in receipt of pre-retirement allowance (PRETA).  It also contains statistics on the pre-retirement credits (PRECS) scheme, systematic short-time workers, smallholders and self-employed persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Following the adoption of the new presentation format and having regard to the greater range of sub-annual data now becoming available, the CSO intends to review its overall presentation of labour market statistics.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with users and will encompass the need for more analyses and address the coherence of the data from different sources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet sub-committee reviewed the findings of relevant Ministers on the extent of the needs of young people in the most disadvantaged areas.  As a result of proposals submitted to Government, a Programme for Young People at Risk has been established.</P>
      <P>The centrepiece of this programme is a young people's facilities and services fund to which £30 million is being provided over the next three years.  This fund will be used to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At least £20 million of this fund will be targeted at those areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.  The initial provision of £1.25 million allocated in the budget is now being increased to £7.5 million.  The fund is in addition to the £10 million already approved by Government <Col N="793" /> towards the implementation of the action plans of the 13 local drug task forces.</P>
    <P>As a further measure to ensure the co-ordination of measures to support young people at risk, the Government have appointed Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to be Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in addition to Health and Children.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Minister of State with special responsibility for the national drugs strategy team, I intend to meet the chairpersons of the local drugs task forces in the near future to outline the Government's plans in relation to the operation of this fund.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the conduct of Cabinet meetings and Cabinet sub-committees is an internal matter for Govenment.  However, the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion will meet as frequently as required to co-ordinate the various initiatives which are being taken in the area of social inclusion.</P>

      <P>I am fully conscious of the need to ensure the most equitable regional distribution of job opportunities. Within a week of taking office I spoke to the chief executive officers of both IDA Ireland and Forbairt.  I impressed on them the crucial importance which this Government attaches to making even greater efforts to provide employment throughout the country.  I am satisfied that this message is fully understood and that the industrial development agencies involved are doing all they can to realise a more balanced regional distribution of jobs.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the present special focus on regionalisation is impacting on the spread of jobs. Since this Government came into office I announced industrial investments outside of Dublin which will lead to the creation of over 11,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ensuring that there is a greater number of jobs created in regions outside Dublin than in the past.</P>

      <P>On foot of commitments given to the US authorities, the US Government does not intend to proceed with the World Trade Organisation action referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Current Irish legislation on copyright is incorporated mainly in the 1963 Copyright Act and I wish to take this opportunity to assure the Deputy and the House that the Government is fully committed to introducing a comprehensive Copyright and Related Rights Bill as a matter of the utmost priority to take account of technological developments since 1963, EU developments and international agreements including the TRIPS agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intellectual property unit of my Department and the Attorney General's office are currently operating a fast track drafting mechanism which I am confident will lead to a comprehensive Bill of over 400 sections being published by the end of July.  I hope that the Bill will be presented to the Oireachtas in the autumn session and that, with hard work by all sides of this House <Col N="795" /> and the Seanad, this new legislation will be implemented by the end of the year and will ensure that Ireland will enter the new millennium with a state of the art copyright and related rights protection system.</P>
    <P>In the interim, and in an attempt to address some very real weaknesses in existing Irish copyright law which have come to attention arising from consultations between Ireland and the US authorities in the recent past, I propose to introduce a short Copyright (Amendment) Bill which will deal with two very specific questions, namely, the level of penalties for copyright infringement and the proof of certain facts in copyright cases.</P>
    <P>In respect of the former I am looking closely at the level of penalties contained in the Trade Marks Act, 1996, as a useful template for action and in respect of the latter I would propose to ensure that the presumptions contained in section 26 of the 1963 Copyright Act be extended to cover all works.  I hope to be in a position to bring forward this short Bill very soon with a view to having it implemented into law by end July 1998.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by copyright and related rights involve issues related to private property rights.  They are highly technical and require detailed examination and a cautious and balanced approach.  I assure the Deputy that I intend to act as expeditiously as possible given these constraints and intend to adhere to the timetable outlined above to ensure that Ireland enters the new millennium at the forefront of intellectual property protection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The multilateral agreement on investment, known as the MAI, is being negotiated under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development &mdash; the OECD &mdash; in Paris.  It will be a free-standing international treaty open to all countries willing and able to meet its obligations.  Negotiations are due to be completed this year.</P>
      <P>Countries which become party to the MAI will commit themselves to treat foreign investors no less favourably than they treat their own investors. They will also agree not to discriminate among investors of different MAI parties.  Other important provisions will include the following: transparency of laws and regulations; the right to transfer funds to and from the host country, although governments will be able to suspend this right temporarily in the event of a balance of payments or monetary crisis; the right of the investor to bring key personnel to the host country, subject to general immigration laws; the prohibition of certain performance requirements &mdash; such as minimum export targets &mdash; as a condition for allowing an investment to be set up and the right of a foreign investor to adequate and effective compensation in the event of the expropriation of property.</P>
      <P>All of these provisions will be underpinned by a dispute resolution system both between states and between the investor and the host state.</P>
      <P>Where countries are willing and able to implement the main thrust of the MAI but have difficulties with specific obligations, they will have the opportunity to negotiate country-specific exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government supports the conclusion of the MAI and expects that this country will, in due course, become a party to it.  This would allow us to give yet another important signal to foreign investors that they are welcome here.  We already <Col N="800" /> treat foreign investors favourably and would not, therefore, need to make fundamental changes in order to honour our commitments.</P>
    <P>The agreement would also be of value to our outward investors in that it would allow them compete on a level playing field in the markets of countries which choose to become party to the MAI.  They would also benefit from the assurance that they can repatriate their profits here, employ Irish managers and specialised technicians, and have a right of fair and adequate compensation if their property in another MAI country were ever expropriated.</P>
    <P>I am aware that criticisms of this proposed agreement have been voiced by some development agencies because of concerns that it would have a negative effect on developing countries. While all OECD countries are expected to sign the agreement, there is no similar expectation in the case of non-OECD countries.  All countries willing and able to meet the obligations of the MAI will be welcome to sign the agreement, but no-one will be obliged to do so.  If a particular country decided to sign the MAI, it would increase its attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment.  However, it would be for every country to decide for itself whether the balance of advantage lay in signing the agreement or not.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 41, 96, 97 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>A review of the access to finance schemes was commissioned as part of the wider review of the operational programme for small business by the programme's monitoring committee.  The review was presented to the monitoring committee at its meeting of 19 November 1997.</P>
      <P>The review concluded that the scheme has generally been implemented effectively and efficiently and forecasts that it will contribute strongly to the objectives of increased viability of small business via the provision of low-cost finance, increased capacity to adapt to the Single Market and increased employment within small business.</P>
      <P>The review found that over 1,400 small businesses availed of the scheme, drawing down all £208 million which was available by the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>The review noted that over 9,000 new jobs are expected to result from the scheme and it stated that if the projected job creation figures are realised, this would render the scheme as offering high value for money from a public sector initiative perspective.</P>
      <P>The review also presented comments with a view to guiding future policy in relation to public support in the area of small business finance.  It recommended that primary quantitative research into the financing problems of small business be carried out ahead of any moves towards designing a future State support scheme.  The review also recommended that funding be made available under the operational programme to finance such research.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee of the small business operational programme accepted the recommendations made in the review, including the recommendation that research on the financing problems of small business should be undertaken. The terms of reference for such research are currently being finalised and I hope to be in a position to commission the study shortly.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House has been informed in response to previous similar questions, following the publication of the Deloitte and Touche report on Insurance Costs in 1996, the issue of the high cost of motor insurance for young drivers has been receiving continuing close attention from my Department, in consultation with the insurance industry and other Departments and agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> The consultant's report found that premium rates in EU countries are high for all young drivers relative to rates charged to more mature motorists.  This reflects the significantly higher insurance risk represented by young drivers as a category based on their claims experience.  It follows simply and logically from that fact that the key to reducing insurance premiums for young drivers is to raise their standards of safe driving. This is not only in their own interest, but in the wider interests of the community at large who suffer the consequences of unsafe driving by young motorists.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken to improve driving standards and safety awareness among young drivers.  These include the introduction of a scheme of insurance premium discounts by the insurance industry in conjunction with the driving instructors register on completion of a required number of driving lessons; the introduction of road safety educational programmes for students and advertising campaigns to discourage speeding by the National Road Safety Authority; and the on-going examination by the Department of the Environment and Local Government of a graduated licensing system for learner drivers.</P>
    <P>As a result of a series of meetings which I have had with the industry, Guardian PMPA, the leading motor insurer, recently announced the introduction of a special 6 per cent introductory discount for young male drivers aged 17 to 24 years who currently receive a nil no claim discount, with reductions also being given to young female drivers.  The Hibernian Insurance Company is also operating a smiliar scheme.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to point out that these concessions to young drivers have been introduced against the background of increasing underwriting losses in motor insurance.  The 1996 annual insurance report prepared by our Department, showed that motor insurance underwriting losses increased from £41 million in 1995 to £90 million in 1996. The deteriorating underwriting situation has led some insurers to announce increases in certain insurance categories in 1998.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, any reductions or discounts offered to the young drivers must effectively be subsidised by increased premia paid by lower risk categories of motorist.  It does not make good commercial sense, nor is it equitable, that safer drivers should subsidise less responsible drivers.  That simply reduces the incentive for safe driving among all classes of motorists leading to increased claims costs and a progressive deterioration in insurers' underwriting accounts.  The end result is that average motor insurance premia in the economy will operate at a higher level than would otherwise obtain if the principle of riskbased premium setting is strictly applied to all motor insurance categories.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the only realistic solution to the problem of high premia for young motorists is to effect a sustained quantum <Col N="803" /> improvement in their overall safety performance on the road.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The insurance ombudsman scheme was launched in October 1992 and funded by the insurance industry.  To ensure the independence of the ombudsman the operation of the service was divided into three components.  The first is a board comprising executives elected from those insurers taking part in the scheme.  The second is a council made up of nominees from within and outside the industry.  The council recruits and appoints the ombudsman, subject to the approval of the board.  The third component is the office of the ombudsman itself, where policyholder disputes <Col N="805" /> are referred and resolved.  The member companies of the scheme are bound by the ombudsman's decisions.</P>
    <P>The present ombudsman was appointed at the outset of the scheme in 1992.  In seeking the endorsement of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce for the launch of the scheme, the industry expanded the draft terms of reference at the behest of the Minister to provide greater discretion to the ombudsman in the determination of issues in dispute between policyholder and insurer.</P>
    <P>As documented in its recent five year review, the office of the insurance ombudsman has proved to be an outstanding success as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.  It has settled disputes and complaints by mediation and conciliation in addition to issuing written adjudications in more intractable cases.  It has provided an invaluable service to the consumer and led to improved sales practices and claims handling by insurance companies participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>As the insurance ombudsman service is a private sector scheme it would not be appropriate for me to comment on matters related to the conditions and duration of appointment of the ombudsman.  Neither would it be appropriate for me to comment on the resignation of a member of the council.  My primary concern is to ensure, in the interests of the consumer, as policyholder, that whoever holds the office of ombudsman is enabled to discharge the responsibilities of that office in accordance with the terms of reference. My colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy, the Minister with responsibility for science, technology and commerce, will be meeting with the members of the council at its invitation to discuss the existing arrangements for the operation of the scheme in the light of the experience gained over the past five years and to satisfy himself that these arrangements are being operated in a way which enables the ombudsman to independently and effectively discharge the functions of the office in accordance with the terms of reference.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, comprise a comprehensive legislative framework governing the incorporation and operation of companies within this jurisdiction.  In essence, the aim of the legislation is to provide the necessary framework within which companies can operate and thereby provide those operating companies and dealing with companies with a degree of certainty in respect of the manner in which these companies are to be operated.  It is important to point out that the companies legislation does not operate to regulate or govern the actual areas or activities in which the companies decide to operate or engage.  At any one time, various aspects of company law are subject to review and reform.  For instance, the Company Law Review Group has made recommendations for changes in six specific areas and I will be proceeding with implementation of these on a phased basis.</P>

      <P>I understand that a receiver was appointed to three companies in the Tipperary Crystal Group in October 1996 and that a liquidator was subsequently appointed to these three companies, as well as two other companies in the group.  My sole function under the Designated Funds Act, 1985, is to ensure that all prospectuses and other promotional material for individual business expansion schemes comply with section 5 of the Act and thus ensure that the investor is fully informed of the risks of the BES investments.  My Department has no involvement in business expansion schemes, once they are launched.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that among the duties of a liquidator is that of inquiring into the reasons for a company's failure.  Section 298 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended provides a mechanism, whereby any liquidator, creditor or contributor can apply to the High Court to have the affairs of a company examined where there has been misfeasance or other breach of trust in relation to the company.  In view of the option open to those affected by the failure of these companies, I do not currently propose to appoint an inspector or a section 19 authorised officer to this company under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> In recent years there has been major activity in the pharmaceutical industry in mergers and takeovers. This is being driven by a corporate desire to consolidate positions in the marketplace, reduce costs and, in the case of public companies, to improve investor confidence in the company's stock.</P>
    <P>Employment and other implications, including possible job losses in Irish plants, are monitored by my Department and the relevant industrial development agencies.  In the case referred to by Deputy Timmins, IDA Ireland is in direct contact with the parties involved with a view to ensuring, as far as possible, that Irish interests are not adversely affected by the proposed merger.  The Deputy can rest assured that I will be following developments closely and will make contact, if necessary, with the pharmaceutical companies in question.  The companies will have to comply with relevant EU or Irish legislation on mergers and take-overs as well as with any IDA grant agreement requirements in respect of their Irish operations.</P>

      <P>The Expert Skills Group is carrying out analysis of the future skills needs of the economy and is developing proposals to meet these needs.  The group has met twice since early December and will meet again in March.  This group will report on a regular basis to a high level implementation group whose task is to ensure that proposals by the Expert Skills Group are progressed as a matter of priority.  The Expert Skills Group is expected to make its initial report to the implementation group by the end of April next.</P>
      <P>While further strong growth is expected in the information technology industry, projections for labour requirements for up to ten years from now have not been calculated.  Indeed, given the rapid pace of technological developments in this industry, it is felt that such long-term projections could not be considered reliable.  However, it has been estimated that employment in the industry could reach some 57,000 over the next three years.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work, Act 1989 and the 1993 general application regulations provide a comprehensive legislative framework by means of which effective health and safety procedures can be formed and managed in all sectors of the economy. In addition, the 1995 construction regulations, which consititute one of the most detailed pieces of legislation dealing with any one industry, deal specifically and comprehensively with the construction sector.  Those regulations require that health and safety considerations form an integral part of project planning in the construction industry.  They introduced the important concept of a chain of responsibility and duty on everyone involved in the process, that is, the client, the designer, the project supervisor, at both the design and construction stage, the contractor and the employee.  This makes health and safety an integral part of construction work from inception through to completion.  Among the specific duties imposed by the regulations is an obligation to prepare, before the commencement of the construction work, a safety and health plan for the construction site.  There are also obligations to maintain a safety file and appoint safety officers.</P>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Health and Safety is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation. Under the 1995 construction regulations, written notification of projects which are planned to last longer than 30 working days or on which the volume of work is scheduled to exceed 500 person-days must be given to the authority.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the law already contains comprehensive provision requiring that health and safety be an integral part of project planning in the construction industry and imposing duties on all parties involved in the process.  However, it should be noted that, under the 1989 Act, the primary duty to identify, assess and manage the health and safety needs of any business rests with the employer.</P>

      <P>A number of measures have been put in place to promote awareness, preparation and competitiveness of Irish business during the run-in period to EMU. These include: a special EMU business awareness campaign led by Forfás; a guide specifically designed for exporters was published by An Bord Tráchtála (ABT) in 1997; both the European offices and staff in Ireland of ABT are available to assist exporters with queries on EMU or currency exchange rate issues; and ABT's export development programme in Europe was stepped up in 1997 with expenditure of £10 million supporting exporters in continental markets, and this is continuing in 1998.  Irish exporters of goods and services continue to have available to them a full range of supports through the programmes of the State agencies.</P>
      <P>The competitiveness of Irish business is of course, a critical issue in the run up to EMU and beyond.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52, 59, 73, 84 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group was established by my predecessor on 30 September, 1996 with the following terms of reference: To review and make recommendations on the mergers legislation in the context of a legislative consolidation; the effectiveness of competition legislation and associated regulations; cultural matters in the context of the 1991 Competition Act and, in particular, section 4(2) of that Act; and appropriate structures for implementation of the above legislation.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House on 6 November 1997, I have also asked the review group to advise me on how best to implement certain recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry in relation to the regulation of ownership, merger control and concentration of media ownership.  I do not yet have an indication as to when the group is likely to submit its report.</P>

      <P>Under the Competition Act, 1996, the Competition authority and the director of Competition Enforcement have powers to act against alleged abuses of competition legislation.  In particular, any abuse of a dominant position can be pursued by the authority and by the Director of Competition Enforcement with stringent penalties provided for in respect of proven abuse.  The Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for enforcing the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 which, <i>inter alia,</i> protects small retail grocers in that it prohibits below cost selling and advertising in this sector.</P>
      <P>The Competition and Mergers Review Group established by my predecessor is currently examining the Order as part of its terms of reference.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety.  The Act applies to all places of work and to self-employed workers.  It outlines clearly the responsibilities of employers and employees in relation to providing and maintaining a safe working environment.  Under section 12 of this Act, an employer is obliged to prepare a safety statement which is based on an identification and assessment of the hazards and risks to health and safety at the place of work and the arrangements made to safeguard the safety and health of employees.</P>
      <P>In addition, Parts VI and VII of the 1993 general application regulations deal specifically with areas of work which may involve particular musculoskeletal risk factors such as the manual handling of loads and work with display screen equipment. Under these regulations employers must take steps to identify risks, carry out a risk assessment examination for every risk factor and take appropriate measures to eliminate or reduce the risks involved.</P>
      <P>As part of its 1998 national programme, the National Authority for Occupational Health and Safety has targeted occupational health, including work-related upper limb disorders, as an area in which there will be a programme of inspection, advice and general awareness raising efforts. There are no plans to introduce additional measures to the ones which I have outlined.</P>

      <P>Since the announcement of its closure with the loss of 296 jobs, management at Applied Magnetics has been extremely proactive in organising placement services for employees.  The company recently facilitated other multinationals in the locality by permitting them to carry out interviews with employees on site.  Due to the nature and level of employee skills, which are currently very much in demand, it is expected that the workers will be successful in securing alternative employment with other overseas companies in the area.</P>
      <P>The facility, which is owned by Applied Magnetics, will be jointly marketed by the company and IDA Ireland.

      <P>As the Deputies are aware, the allegations of tax evasion in connection with the sale of insurance products through National Irish Bank are currently the subject of official investigations by both the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners. My Department's responsibility in the matter is to ascertain whether any breaches of insurance law or, possibly, company law have occurred.  In that regard, I sought detailed information on 27 January 1998 from National Irish Bank on a number of points.  The bank replied to my letter on 29 January 1998 and the matter was referred for legal advice.</P>
      <P>I am awaiting that legal advice, before deciding what further action may be appropriate under the Insurance Acts and-or the Companies Acts, including whether it may be necessary to appoint an authorised officer from my Department to conduct further investigations.</P>

      <P>I understand that under the EU Commission's action plan for completion for the internal market the European Company Statute is scheduled for adoption by the first day of January 1999.  I also understand <Col N="816" /> that the UK Presidency has made the statute a key priority, during its term.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the main stumbling block to the adoption of the statute regulation relates to the worker involvement provisions, which would apply to a statute company in a separate, but linked &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; measure.  Efforts at resolving these problems have been under consideration for some time, by the social questions group of the social affairs council and I understand that the UK Presidency is seeking to build on progress made by the outgoing Luxembourg Presidency in an attempt to reach agreement on the measure at the social questions group, where discussions are ongoing.</P>
      <P>The UK Presidency also proposes to have parallel discussions in the internal market council, with a view to advancing the outstanding company law issues in relation to the draft regulation. The Presidency's hope is that significant progress can be made in relation to the worker related issues before the discussion on outstanding company law issues commences at the internal market council.  It is too early to say if agreement will be reached on the statute by the end of the UK Presidency.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that preparation of the necessary implementing instruments here cannot be undertaken until the statute itself and associated worker involvement measures are adopted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>Reducing unemployment is the Government's prime economic mission over the next five years. Our rate of unemployment has now fallen to less than 10 per cent, in line with the EU average.  The fall is welcome, but inadequate.  I believe that we can reduce unemployment to around 5 per cent over the next four to five years with the current policies in place.  The Government's first budget in December was firmly geared towards increasing employment and reducing unemployment. Among the budget measures that are significant in terms of long-term unemployed persons, including those over 35 years of age, are the extra 7,000 places provided in back to work and community employment and the major changes in family income supplement.</P>
      <P>I am engaged in ongoing assessment of labour market policy and policy instruments with a view to ensuring that they are effectively focused on preventing drift into long-term unemployment and securing the maxium reintegration of long-term unemployed people into employment.  I am also co-operating with my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, to ensure that our policies are consistent with assisting the maximum number of unemployed persons back into the labour market.</P>
      <P>In addition, I specifically mandated the new board of FÁS to address how to increase the access of long-term unemployed to training programmes; how to enable the long-term unemployed access the higher skills programmes; and how to improve the reintegration of community employment participants into open market jobs.</P>

      <P>It is not clear to me what trends the Deputy is referring to.</P>
      <P>Based on both the labour force survey and the live register the unemployment rate for young persons under 25 is falling.  Based on the labour force survey &mdash; International Labour Office &mdash; measure, the numbers unemployed fell by 7.6 per cent in the 12 months to mid-April 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recent indicators based on the live register also reveal the improving position for persons under 25.  In the 12 months to January 1998, there has been a cumulative fall of over 10,000 in the numbers under 25 signing on the live register. <Col N="819" /> This reduction of over 16 per cent compares with the national average fall, for all persons signing on, of 8.3 per cent over the same period.</P>
    <P>The most recent Central Statistics Office data for registered long-term unemployment &ldquo;The Age by Duration Analysis of the Live Register&rdquo;&mdash; shows that the rate of fall of persons under 25 out of work for one year or more, at 25 per cent, was significantly faster than the national average fall, of 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>These positive indicators are further supported by results of the most recent school leavers survey published in December 1997 which revealed a continuation of the improvement in the employment prospects of school leavers with employment levels rising considerably and unemployment levels falling.</P>
    <P>The fact that the trends are positive does not make us complacent.  I would hope in particular that the tax initiative for long-term unemployed and the increase in the PRSI allowance from £80 to £100 per week introduced in the budget will encourage young people to take up available jobs.</P>
    <P>Last year the number of people at work in the Irish economy grew by 41,000.  The numbers at work will grow by at least the same amount this year and the unemployment rate will fall further. These are positive times for young persons who are looking for employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81, 83 and 121 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy of a number of recent developments which have taken place in relation to the prevention of obstacles to trade within the Single Market.  Arising from recent disruption of the free passage of Irish goods at United Kingdom ports, the Minister of State at my Department with responsibility for Single Market matters, Deputy Tom Kitt, wrote to the International Market Commissioner, Mario Monti, expressing the Government's deep concern at the impact of the blockade on the functioning of the Internal Market.  He asked that the Commissioner and his colleagues take all possible steps to ensure that the rules of the Single Market are respected by all member states.  Minister of State Kitt also spoke to his British opposite number, Lord Simon of Highbury, to express the Government's deep concern at the obstruction to trade.  The Deputy will also be aware that the matter was raised by the Taoiseach with the British Prime Minister, and that the Ministers for Agriculture and Food, Foreign Affairs and Public Enterprise asked their British counterparts to take the necessary measures to ensure the free flow of trade through UK ports.</P>
      <P>The general question of obstacles to the free movement of goods within the Single Market was discussed at the Amsterdam European Council last June.  The council requested the European Commission to submit proposals to effectively guarantee the free movement of goods.  The commission's proposal, which would provide an accelerated legal procedure for formal commission intervention at an early stage to limit obstacles to trade, has since been submitted.  I welcome this proposal and I support the UK Presidency's efforts to obtain agreement at council.</P>
      <P>Regarding EU Competition Law, Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, concerning competition and abuse of abdominal positions do not apply in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>Insurance costs for public liability, which includes product liability, protects the policyholder against claims for personal injury or material damage caused to any member of the public.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte and Touche report on an Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland found that, over the period from 1985 to 1994, the number of public liability claims remained fairly constant, averaging about 15,500 per annum, while the average cost of claims, increased by about 8 per cent per annum, in real terms.</P>
      <P>The consultants' comparative survey of liability costs in 1995 in selected EU countries, based on sample quotations for a number of small and medium-sized companies, showed that the average UK public liability quotation was 59 per cent of the Irish average and in Denmark was 13 per cent of the Irish average premiums quotation.  For total liability, including public liability and employers' liability, the average premium quotation in the Netherlands was 14 per cent of the Irish premium and, in France, the average premium quotation was 90 per cent of the Irish average quotation.</P>
      <P>In assessing the significance of the comparisons of liability premia, Deloitte and Touche concluded that the higher levels of expenditure on social protection by other EU countries relative to Ireland meant that, because State health and social welfare expenditures in these other countries covered substantially more of the costs of sickness and disability arising from workplace and other personal injuries, the level of liability insurance cover required by employers in the other EU countries was less than in Ireland.  The consultants found that countries, with proportionately higher levels of social protection expenditure than Ireland, have lower net written premia for liability insurance.  For example, the Netherlands expenditure on social protection in 1993 was 33.6 per cent of GDP, compared with 21.4 per cent for Ireland; while net written liability insurance was 0.07 per cent of GDP in the Netherlands, compared with 0.65 per cent of GDP in Ireland.</P>
      <P>A special working group, established under the aegis of our Department, will be looking at social protection coverage in other EU countries as part of the group's examination of alternative systems of delivering personal injury compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report found that local authorities and semi-State bodies in Ireland had reduced public liability insurance costs through a combination of safety training, reform of work practices and vigorous challenging of dubious claims.  The report also dealt with the concerns of tourism and recreational interests at the rise in public liability premia.  The report pointed out that the introduction of the 1995 Occupier Liability Act had strengthened the position of proprietors of recreational and tourist <Col N="822" /> facilities by modifying the previous onerous common law duty of care owed to visitors, recreational users and trespassers and thus reducing the proprietors' exposure to public liability claims.  It is expected that this legislation will, in the course of time, have a downward impact on the cost of claims and on liability premia.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a liquidator was appointed to Millfield Textiles Limited on 3 February last as the company had not been able to achieve the necessary visability to stay in business.  I am conscious that among the duties of a liquidator is that of inquiring into the reasons for a company's failure.  Section 298 of the Companies Act, 1963, as amended, provides a mechanism whereby any liquidator, creditor or contributor can apply to the High Court to have the affairs of a company examined where there has been misfeasance or other breach of trust in relation to the company.  In view of the equivalent option open to those affected by the failure of this company, I do not propose to order an investigation into the company under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>The retention of secondary benefits is a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to consider, and I have no function in the matter.  I understand, however, that, in the main, participants on FÁS training programmes do retain their secondary benefits such as Christmas bonus, medical card, fuel allowance etc.  In the case of the Youthreach this is a programme for early school leavers, the majority of whom would be under 18 years of age and would not generally have welfare entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only difficulty arises in relation to supplementary welfare allowance benefits where training payments can be assessed as part of an individual's means.  Even then, few individuals should be affected, as FÁS training allowances are at the same, or at a slightly higher, level than <Col N="823" /> the unemployment payment of which an individual would have been in receipt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 104 together.</P>
      <P>At a time when my Department is engaged in very sensitive and wide-ranging discussions with representatives of the insurance industry, consumer interests and other relevant experts on life assurance transparency regulations it is a matter of serious concern that confidential discussion documents have been disclosed to the media, the details of which are still the subject of negotiation with relevant parties.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House and for the public record I will reiterate the salient points in the reply which I gave to a simialr written question by Deputy Owen on 5 February last.  The objective in introducing life assurance transparency regulations will be to provide the consumer, as of legal right, with easy to understand pre-contractual and post-contractual information on essential features and key areas associated with purchasing a life assurance product.</P>
      <P>The prime objectives in the formulation of such a regime are an end to over-complication in the presentation of such products; the minimisation of mis-selling and confusion; adoption of realistic investment projections, where relevant; transparency on charges and expenses; a knowledge of with whom the insurance consumer is dealing; and adequate redress through a firm statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The proposed introduction of life assurance transparency regulations is necessitated by the failure of the insurance industry to adapt and respond to the growing demand by insurance consumers for reasonable disclosure by suppliers of life assurance of the risks and benefits associated with purchasing life asssurance products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> The insurance ombudsman has consistently referred to the dissatisfaction expressed by complainants over surrender values of policies and to the fact that many complaints occur because of poor communication, lack of understanding of information at the time policy is purchased and misunderstandings in relation to nil-allocation or non-investment in assurance and investment policies in the early years.  The insurance ombudsman also pointed out that there was an onus on prospective purchasers of life assurance policies to take care to read and understand the policy documentation themselves.</P>
    <P>My Department's discussions with the insurance industry have focused on the effect which charges, including commissions and sales remuneration, can have on reducing the amount of the premium available for investment, especially in the early years, and on the surrender value and maturity value of the insurance policy. The Department's objective is to have all charges and deductions from the premium payment disclosed at the outset in a way that will enable the policyholder to readily establish, taking all charges into account, the real return on the gross premium investment.  With regard to the separate identification of commission within the statement of total charges, my Department has been seeking to devise, in consultation with the insurance industry, a workable formula for calculating the &ldquo;equivalent of commission&rdquo; in sales remuneration in direct sales of life policies.  This is a very complex process.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations are aimed at informing any person who proposes, directly to an insurer or directly through an insurance intermediary, to purchase a life assurance product.  It is proposed that all suppliers of life assurance must supply to the customer before he or she signs a proposal or application form, information, in writing, in a clear, prominent and accurate manner as prescribed in the draft regulations.  The information will include full details of the supplier of life assurance, including the legal form of the insurer's name, the regulatory authority granted to the insurer or intermediary, and details of the nature of the relationship between the insurer and the intermediary.</P>
    <P>Information shall be provided in respect of the terms and conditions of the proposed insurance policy, including information on the benefits and options, available to the proposer and the laws applicable to the contract; the circumstances under which the contract may be cancelled by either party and the arrangements for application of the cooling-off period &mdash; the existing cooling-off period of 15 days will continue to apply; the means of calculation and distribution of bonuses and a statement of the units to which the benefits are linked and the assets underlying unit-linked policies; the arrangements for handling disputes about the life assurance policy including the option of recourse to the insurance ombudsman service; the purpose and intention of the policy, i.e. whether it is a protection or savings policy, <Col N="825" /> or a combination of both; the type of policy, for example, regular premium savings or single premium investment, regular or single premium pension, critical illness cover or permanent health insurance and whether policies are index-linked; the long-term nature of the policy; a statement outlining the cost of the insurance policy and the means and duration of payment of premiums; a prominent statement indicating whether the policy acquires a surrender or early encashment value and the consequences of cessation of payment of premiums; and a prominent statement indicating that early surrender of the policy, whether through non-payment of premiums or voluntarily, may result in a surrender value which is less than the aggregate of the premiums paid up to the date of surrender.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations also provide that information shall be made available to the policyholder during the term of the insurance contract related to any change in the name, legal form, address, branch name or address of the insurer.</P>
    <P>Widespread support has been received from all parties concerned, including the Consumers Association of Ireland, for the provision to the policyholder of a tabular statement showing, for each of the years one to five and every five years thereafter up to maturity, the premium payment, the total deductions in respect of all charges and expenses, including commissions, the cumulative value of the investment and the surrender value for early encashment.  The tabular statement will be the key element of the new disclosure regime and will provide the policyholder with clear and comprehensive information from the outset and throughout the policy term.  Allied to the table will be a number of prominent health warnings indicating essential features and some of the risks associated with the policy, notably the effects of early surrender, the illustrative &mdash; non-guaranteed &mdash; nature of the rates of return, premium reviews where premium is not guaranteed to provide benefits-returns illustrated, taxation arrangements, long-term nature of the policy and service fees.</P>
    <P>It is intended to make it an offence for any supplier of insurance who knowingly or recklessly makes a false or deceptive statement or dishonestly conceals material facts to induce a customer to take out a policy or insurance or who gives a false or misleading impression as to the value of a policy of insurance in terms of its investment performance and &mdash; or surrender value.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that the proposals as outlined not only supplement minimum life assurance policyholder disclosure requirements under EU law but also greatly exeed them in terms of effectiveness, clarity and overall content. The regulations should also bring about a level of consistency across the insurance industry in so far as consumer protection is concerned and indeed act as a catalyst to encourage other competing financial service providers to institute comparable transparency measures.  It <Col N="826" /> is a matter for other financial services' regulators to decide whether a need exists for greater transparency across the range of comparable investment products including disclosure of intermediaries' remuneration. The present proposals are in respect of life insurance products only.  They do not address non-insurance investment products marketed and sold by other financial services institutions.</P>
    <P>To date, I have taken no decision on these matters and will finally do so, only when the various discussions are concluded.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any widespread problem that unqualified persons are describing themselves as accountants. Neither am I aware that our existing statutory arrangements fall short of those applying in the EU generally.  If the Deputy or any other persons have evidence that unqualified persons are advertising themselves as accountants, they should bring it to the attention of the Director of Consumer affairs.  Enforcement action may be possible under section 6 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which deems it an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> to make false or reckless statements as to the provision of services.</P>
      <P>There are statutory controls in place to ensure that a person acting as an auditor is properly qualified.  This is a particularly important role, because audit clearance is relied on by many thousands of people in business as an independent assurance that a company is in a satisfactory financial position.  The vast majority of persons acting as auditors are members of an accountancy body recognised by me under section 191 of the Companies Act, 1990.  Six accountancy bodies are so recognised at present in this country.</P>
      <P>My Department treats very seriously complaints received from the general public that persons are acting as auditors without being qualified to do so.  In 1997, following investigation, four persons were convicted of this offence under the Companies Acts.</P>
      <P>Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, which is the responsibility of my Government colleague the Minister for Finance, persons who provide investment business services or investment advice, including the holding of client funds, require to be authorised either by the Central Bank of Ireland or by a competent authority in another member state.  Our legislation in this area is in line with EU requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the direct regulation undertaken by the Central Bank, the Minister for Finance has recently indicated his intention to introduce new <Col N="828" /> legislation which will provide compensation to the clients of certain categories of intermediary where they are unable to obtain the return of funds entrusted to intermediaries covered by the scheme.  This new legislation will give effect to the Investor Compensation Directive.</P>

      <P>The Government is acutely aware of the problems that some Irish registered non-resident companies are giving rise to and of the urgent need to put measures in place to address these problems.  An IFSC working group made up of representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, my own Department, Revenue, Central Bank, the IDA and some private sector interests who are members of the IFSC Banking and Treasury Committee has been actively considering proposals over a wide area in an effort to come up with workable solutions to what is a difficult and complex issue.</P>
      <P>Among the proposals being considered are some in the company law area put forward by my Department, which is being assisted in its deliberations by Forfás, IDA and Forbairt.  While I am not in a position to give details of possible legislation at this stage the broad thrust of whatever action is taken in the company law area will be aimed at a tightening up of the registration process consistent with avoiding the imposition of undue cost and administrative burdens on business at large.  A key challenge therefore will be the achievement of a proper balance in this area. The Government will respond swiftly to any reasonable proposals emerging.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Companies Registration Office which has been allocated additional resources in the past 12 months is now in a much better position to monitor compliance of companies with existing company law requirements as regards the making of annual returns and such like and to respond more effectively and speedily where non-compliance is occurring.</P>

      <P>A number of initiatives are being planned or are already under way to secure an upgrading in the quality of our human resources with a view to reaching the level of best practice in competitor countries, with a resultant increase in labour productivity. For example, an awareness programme on the skills and training needs of Irish industry is being developed to run initally over a two-year period.  A programme of training networks is being developed under which State support will be available to groups of firms with a view to developing their own best practice network.</P>
      <P>Management training in small enterprises will be a priority for the new company development agency.  Furthermore, county enterprise boards will be placing a stronger emphasis on the development of management capability at the micro enterprise level.</P>

      <P>BioResearch Ireland established in 1988, under the then Government's National Biotechnology Programme, has a major role in the development and commercialisation or biotechnology inventions. Its five university based research centres perform contract research and product development to industrial clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently, biotechnological inventions can be protected in Ireland under either the Patents Act, 1992, or the regional law of the European Patent Convention (EPC).  A proposal for an EU Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, which seeks to secure harmony between existing national laws and the EPC, and uniform interpretation in the courts, was approved by the European Parliament at its first reading in July last.  The proposed Directive was also adopted by the Internal Market Council on <Col N="830" /> 21 November, 1997.

      <P>The two programmes in question &mdash; advanced technical skills, ATA, and specific skills training, SST &mdash; are co-financed from Structural Funds under the Human Resources Development Operational Programme, HRD-OP.  The reductions referred to were effected by the decisions on reallocations of Structural Funds, taken in the context of the mid-term review of the Community Suppport Framework, by the CSF monitoring committee which met last July.  They were further endorsed by the HRD-OP monitoring committee at its meeting last October.  They were part of a package of reallocations which resulted in a net increase in the funds available to the HRD-OP.</P>
      <P>In taking those decisions, the relevant monitoring committees were informed in particular by the ESRI mid-term review report on Structural Funds &mdash; Report No. 31, published in July 1997. That report took account of the changed economic and labour market conditions which had evolved since the Structural Funds programmes were negotiated in 1993 as well as the outcomes from programmes in the period under review.  In that sense, the recommendations in the report, and the reallocations made by the relevant monitoring committees, reflected a reprioritisation of measures within the Structural Funds Programmes. In that context, for example, over half of the 48 mecu reallocated to and within the HRD-OP has been directed towards programmes for early school-leavers which reflects a strengthened priority being given to that area in the programme.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the relevant implementing agencies &mdash; the Department of Education and Science in the case of the ATS measure and FÁS in the case of the specific skills training programme &mdash; to determine how they will respond to the reduced funding.  In the latter case, where I have an indirect responsibility, some reduction in SST activity will be taking place although the seven mecu reduction has to be seen in the context of the 54 mecu ESF support which remains committed over the next two years to the industry training for the unemployed measure, of which SST is a major component.  Furthermore, the reduction is more than balanced by an extra 29 mecu allocation made available to FÁS under the mid-term review process for a range of training and labour market supports, including extra provision for early school-leavers and traineeships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had no correspondence with the Commission on these matters.  There was a negotiation process with the Commission on the Structural Funds mid-term review, led by the Department of Fin ance, operating within parameters set by the <Col N="832" /> Government, and, as mentioned, the formal decisions relating to reallocations were duly taken within the relevant monitoring committees in July and October last.</P>

      <P>A violent earthquake hit northern Afghanistan and southern Tajikistan almost two weeks ago.  Due to the remoteness and inaccesability of the provinces which have been affected, there has been a good deal of difficulty in ascertaining the extent of the damage and the number of lives lost.  Preliminary reports suggest however that between 3,000 and 4,000 people on the Afghani side of the border may have died in the disaster.  In addition, several hundreds have been injured.</P>
      <P>Despite the difficulties with access, a number of relief agencies including the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, have carried out preliminary assessments of the needs of the remaining population in these areas and have distributed limited supplies of food, blankets and emergency medical supplies.  Preliminary estimates by the United Nations indicate that somewhere in the region of 15,000 people may be in urgent need of relief supplies.  Travel to the area however remains very difficult &mdash; the only reliable source of access to the area is by plane from Tajikistan and flights have been hampered by dense fog and heavy rain.</P>
      <P>The Government has made an immediate allocation of £50,000 to provide relief supplies to the affected populations.  This grant is being channelled through the International Committee of the Red Cross, who have extensive experience both of carrying out disaster relief operations and of working in Afghanistan.  The ICRC has the necessary logistics and other expertise in the country and has sent seven specialists to the affected Rostaq region.  The funds will be used to provide airdrops of food and blankets, water and sanitation and medical supplies for the next two months.</P>
      <P>Part of the grant will also be used to carry out continued airborne and ground assessments to determine the exact nature and extent of the needs.  These assessments will obviously inform the possibility of providing further funding for humanitarian and rehabilitation needs in the coming weeks and months.</P>

Any Irish person taking up residence in Saudi Arabia should register at and maintain contact with our embassy in Riyadh, PO Box 94349, Riyadh 11693, telephone (009661) 488 2300, fax (009661) 488 0927.  The embassy will immediately advise Irish citizens if it becomes necessary that increased precautions be taken.  The public practice of any religion, other than Islam, is not permitted in Saudi Arabia.</P>

      <P>There are six State boards-agencies which come under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  These are: Agency for Personnel Service Overseas, APSO, Cultural Relations Committee, CRC, Irish Aid Advisory Committee, IAAC, the National Committee for Development Education, NCDE, The Refugee Agency, and, the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs-NGO Standing Committee on Human Rights. The Department does not keep details of the personal information which the Deputy has requested concerning age profile of members of boards under the aegis of this Department.</P>
      <P>Members of these boards and committees are appointed in a representative rather than a personal capacity on the basis and of their expertise, suitability and experience to serve on these boards or committees.  I am of course conscious of the need to appoint younger people to serve on any of these boards and am only too willing to do so provided they have the required expertise to serve on the board or committee concerned.</P>

      <P>The information requested is commercially sensitive and it would not be appropriate to provide such data, particularly with the emergence of competition in the electricity market in Ireland.  In general terms, however, the cost per unit varies considerably from station to station and is dependent on such issues as technology, fuel type, staffing levels and age of plant. As an example, the older peat stations with their lower thermal efficiency and their higher manpower to capacity ratio would tend to be far more expensive per unit than say a modern combined cycle gas fired plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to transfer 28 million ECU in EU funding from Measure 1 of the Food Sub-Programme was taken as part of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework carried out last year following independent reviews of both the Framework and its component Operational Programmes.</P>
      <P>The main factors taken into account in that decision were: the substantial underspend on measure 1 up to that time and, having regard to the prevailing level and flow of applications under it, the very real danger that the remaining funds might not be fully utilised; and the need to meet commitments and priorities under other measures for which funding had been exhausted.</P>
      <P>The decision to transfer the funding has not been the subject of correspondence with the European Commission.  It was, however, taken by the Community Support Framework Monitoring Committee on which both the European Commission and my Department are represented. That committee re-allocated the transferred funds to areas which will benefit the food industry, either directly or indirectly &mdash; namely, the industry research, technology and innovation measure and control of farmyard pollution.</P>
      <P>The transfer of funds from Measure 1 of the Food Sub-Programme did not impinge on commitments already made under that measure.  It did not result in the decommitment of funds or the abandonment of projects.  With a view to ensuring that the time scale set out in the Community Support Framework for the drawdown of funds is met and in recognition of the time lag between approval and completion of capital projects, the remaining moneys under the measure will be committed shortly.</P>
      <P>Overall progress under the Food Sub-Programme is satisfactory.  The value-added prepared consumer foods and food ingredients sectors continue to show strong growth and contributed to a 4 per cent increase in the value of total exports in 1997.  In the case of employment, it is estimated that, in the period 1994 to 1997, some 10,200 gross jobs were created, which is in excess of an annual average target of 2,000.</P>

      <P>Under the new measures to combat brucellosis which I will introduce from 23 February 1998 all eligible animals being moved into or out of holdings other than direct to a slaughter premises must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement.  In addition, a full round of blood testing all eligible animals is being undertaken in 1998.  In the normal way, <Col N="842" /> farmers will be required to pay their veterinary practitioners for taking blood samples.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that the herd of the person in question is contiguous to a breakdown herd and will be subject to a herd test shortly. Under the contiguous programme my Department will be paying for this and will be contacting her in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <P>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a very rare disease with an incidence of approximately one per million. Ireland has an incidence of the disease in the order of one to three cases per year, although in some years no cases have been recorded.  In 1997 three cases of classical Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were notified to my Department.  No cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have been notified.</P>
      <P>My Department has from time to time issued statements on the matter which are considered appropriate against the background of the low incidence of the disease.  An active surveillance system is in place, which monitors and follows up on suspected cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, including the provision of counselling on an individual basis.  This is in addition to the full range of normal clinical services available to any patient suffering from an infectious disease.</P>
      <P>The Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Advisory Group, was established in 1996 to advise the Minister for Health on Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease related matters including its surveillance, research strategies and international developments generally in this area.  The group meets regularly to monitor the situation both in Ireland and internationally.  The group is comprised of experts in relevant disciplines such as neurology, neuropathology, public health, veterinary medicine and microbiology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> It is of course regrettable that there are any cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Ireland. However, I can assure the Deputy that no effort is being spared to ensure that all available research data and other information that might assist with the control of this disease is available both within my Department and within the general medical profession.</P>

      <P>As I outlined to the House on 3 Febuary last in relation to this issue, additional funding has not been provided for within the Estimates.  The implementation of the award is a matter for the management of the day nurseries in the first instance and is the subject of ongoing discussions between the management of the nurseries, the Eastern Health Board, the Health Service Employer's Agency and the trade union IMPACT.  The full cost of implementing the court's finding will only be available when these discussions have been finalised.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for health boards to determine specific funding arrangements for voluntary agencies supported via the section 65 mechanism.  The Eastern Health Board will have to consider the full cost implications, when these emerge, in the context of its overall funding of child care services within the board.  As discussions are ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I recently announced an initiative on cardiovascular health and cardiac services.  Included in this initiative is a provision for additional paediatric cardiac surgery capacity to be developed at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, in association with the national cardiac unit at the Mater Hospital.  Up to 100 additional procedures for <Col N="844" /> children will be provided.  This additional capacity will mean an increase of 40 per cent in this area. The estimated revenue cost of this development is £2 million.</P>
      <P>The hospital authorities at Crumlin have welcomed this initiative and have stated that they will continue to work with the Department of Health to design and implement the details of the proposed package for paediatric cardiology and cardiac surgery.</P>
      <P>A project team, consisting of officials from my Department and representatives of the hospital, recently completed its brief to develop a plan for the provision of additional theatres at the hospital.  This brief is now being examined by my Department's technical officers and it is my intention that the planning and construction process should be completed without delay.</P>
      <P>Already this year officials from my Department have met Crumlin Hospital representatives to discuss the cardiac services development plan. The hospital's management has been asked to prepare a detailed overall service plan for 1998. Once this plan has been received by my Department, various matters including the cardiac cardiothoracic service will be discussed in detail with the hospital representatives, in order to ensure that the development of services will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am confident that all of these initiatives will have a positive impact on the service levels of this speciality in the near future.</P>

    <P>These figures include the per head of population in health board voluntary hospitals and mental handicap homes.  It should be noted that the expenditure per head of population is an arithmetic average and should be treated with caution.  It is an unweighted average and does not take into consideration a number of demographic and geographical factors.  Cross-regional comparisons of health expenditure are notoriously difficult.</P>
    <P>Based on national policy, people from various areas avail of regional specialities outside their area which would not be reflected in the average for their board.  The same applies to patient traffic flows where for historical, clinical or other reasons, patients may travel to other centres for treatment. These movements can be quite significant.</P>
    <P>The apparent differences in the cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialities outside the area, density of population and the present development of the services.</P>
    <P>The 1995 and 1996 figures reflect the fact that the responsibility for funding the disabled persons' maintenance allowance was transferred to the then Department of Social Welfare in August 1995.</P>

      <P>The most recent figures received from the eight health boards indicate that the uptake levels for completed three-in-one immunisations among children aged 18 months are as follows: EHB, 79 per cent; MHB, 76 per cent; MWHB, 42 per cent (at 12 months); NEHB, 72 per cent; NWHB, 86 per cent; SEHB, 88 per cent; SHB, 77 per cent; WHB, 77 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board is not in a position at present to provide uptake figures for children aged 18 months.  I am advised by the board that the actual uptake is significantly better than the 42 per cent reported, as the board has a large backlog of claims from general practitioners to be processed.  Additional staff resources have been put in place to address this problem.</P>

      <P>Dental treatment services for children are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  For the past number of years health boards have been progressively adopting a planned targeted approach to the delivery of dental services to national school children and phasing out a demand led system.  This is to ensure the optimum use of dental resources and equal access for all national school children to the same level of dental care.</P>
      <P>The school based approach puts an important emphasis on dental health education and prevention. Dental health education programmes are now available to all national schools.  Children in second, fourth and sixth classes are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach.  Subject to available resources the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary.  The provision of fissure sealants for vulnerable teeth is an important element of the preventive programme.  The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  The small number of children who require more frequent attention are identified and the required level of advice, check-ups, treatment, etc.  provided as necessary.</P>
      <P>An emergency service for acute conditions requiring immediate attention is available on demand.</P>
      <P>I am fully satisfied that the school based targeted approach is the most effective way of delivering dental services to children in national schools.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> This measure has been introduced to address the poverty trap which existed in the social welfare system, whereby the automatic withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance once the spouses or partners earnings reached £60 acted as a disincentive to such people to earn in excess of that amount or indeed to take up available employment opportunities in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that as many as 10,000 families will benefit from the introduction of this measure, which will cost some £9.7 million in a full year.  I have no further changes in mind at this time.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the hardship caused to many third level students as a result of capitation charges of £250; if he will agree to cap these charges at the current level, considering the high expenses incurred by students and the low level of maintenance grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, a standardised charge of £150 was levied by the third level colleges in the 1995/96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. <Col N="853" /> This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995/96 and 1996/97 academic years and set for review this year.</P>
      <P>The universities have argued that the true cost of these charges would on average amount to £400 in the 1997/98 academic year and that, increasingly, the services have required subvention from other areas of their income.  The need for improved student services has also been highlighted by both the universities and the technological sector.  In the light of these arguments and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted that the third level institutions could increase this charge to £250 for the 1997/98 academic year.</P>
      <P>I would point out that students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  I also requested the chairman of the Higher Education Authority to reconvene the working group, which was previously established to review and make recommendations on the implementation of the charge, to prepare a framework of good practice in relation to this charge, with particular reference to the principles of transparency and accountability.  The working group has now completed its work and the Higher Education Authority has recently issued the framework to the publicly funded third level institutions.  I have asked the authority to co-ordinate the review after six months, recommended by the working party, of the consultative procedures and their outcome.  I have not taken any decisions about the future arrangements in relation to this charge.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government announced in November that public service pensioners who retired before the commencement dates of restructuring pay deals under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> should benefit from those pay deals on a parity basis subject to a minimum adjustment of 3 per cent in their pensions, or 2 per cent in the case of those pensioners who have already received an advance payment of 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the Government decision, an increase of 2 per cent in their pensions is due to teachers who retired before 1 July 1994 &mdash; the commencement date in the case of teachers of the PCW restructuring pay deals.  The position to date is that this increase, together with arrears of 2 per cent from 1 May 1996, has been included in the monthly pension payment issued at the end <Col N="854" /> of January 1998 to primary and secondary teachers who retired before July 1994.  Vocational educational committees have also been authorised to make payments on the same basis to retired vocational teachers.</P>
