      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As we near the close of the Government's 1798 commemoration programme, I am delighted, as chairperson of the Commemoration Committee, to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted, as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>As Members know, it was the committee's intention to develop a broadranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the United Irishmen and the Fellowship of Freedom that inspired them in 1798.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, it was felt the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated.  Projects such as the International Conference &mdash; 1798 A Bicentenary Perspective, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Governments 1798 Commemoration Scholarship and the RTE Documentary Series &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; are examples of projects funded which duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
      <P>The National Commemoration Committee was also happy to fund projects, such as the Dublin-Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tone's diaries and the Drennan papers, the Humbert and Merriman schools and the restoration of the William Lawless tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Ireland's film festival was a great success and the Glencree peace centre is continuing to develop its programme, &ldquo;From Revolution to Reconciliation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Croppies' Acre Memorial Garden at Collins Barracks, opened by the Taoiseach on 22 <Col N="750" /> November, was developed in association with the Office of Public Works, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the National Museum, and will serve as a lasting memorial to all those who died in 1798.  The 1798 Centre at Enniscorthy which the Taoiseach opened earlier this year, is a shining example of what can be done when State and local bodies work together with a single goal in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 exhibition will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>Many ceremonies took place over the past ten months to mark the rebellion.  One such ceremony attended by the Taoiseach and involving the French military and our Defence Forces took place in Ballina on 22 August to acknowledge France's involvement in 1798.  Throughout the commemoration period, funding was made available at local level to many projects throughout the country.  Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.  Unfortunately, given the limited budget available, it was not possible to fund all the many worthy projects throughout the country.  However, I pay tribute to all the local committees who worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the total cost of the commemoration and on what basis was each project decided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The total budget was approximately £350,000.  There are still some outstanding matters to be resolved.  The projects to be supported were decided by the National Commemoration Committee on the basis of their contribution to the tone and theme of the celebration. For example, we were anxious to have celebrations in Northern Ireland, to involve the Presbyterian community and to make the commemoration inclusive.  Those were the criteria used in deciding the allocation of funds.</P>
      <P>I thank the party leaders and parties opposite for taking part in the debate in the House on 1798.  I also pay tribute to the National Commemoration Committee.  The non-divisive manner of the celebration of 1798, especially given developments in Northern Ireland, was a tribute to everyone who took part in it.</P>

      <Quest>the percentage change in petrol prices, rail fares and bus fares in the past 15 years.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on data collected for the compilation of the consumer price index, it is estimated that, between August 1983 and September 1998, the average price of petrol increased <Col N="751" /> by 15.8 per cent.  Over the same period, average rail fares and bus fares increased by 39.8 per cent and 58.9 per cent respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State satisfied, given the difference in the percentage increases, that the Government is serious about developing a public transport ethos, in view of the enormous increases which have taken place?  We are now facing more increases.  Petrol prices have increased by 15.8 per cent in the past 15 years while over the same period average rail fares and bus fares increased by 39 per cent and 58 per cent respectively.  Nothing is being done to promote the whole ethos of public transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Minister for Public Enterprise is valid.  The increases came under successive Governments.  The Minister for Public Enterprise and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have announced a number of public transport initiatives in recent weeks and months which will go some way towards meeting the Deputy's concern.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if the Central Statistics Office has been informed by EUROSTAT of the updated GDP statistics for the counties or regions of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Estimates of GDP <i>per capita</i> for the EU and its regions, expressed in purchasing power parities &mdash; PPPs &mdash; to allow for differences in price levels between member states, were received by the Central Statistics Office from EUROSTAT by e-mail on Wednesday afternoon, 18 November.</P>
      <P>These estimates incorporate the latest data supplied by the member states.  They showed that Ireland was at 95 per cent of the EU average over the period 1994-6.  The conversion of the Irish Estimates to a PPP basis is still the subject of discussion with EUROSTAT regarding some technical issues.  However, any resulting amendment is likely to be of a relatively minor nature, probably amounting to no more than 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the figures produced by EUROSTAT affect our application for Objective One status for the various counties, particularly in the Border region?  Will they form the basis on which decisions will be taken at European level as regards Objective One status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Provisional accounts for 1996 together with amended details for 1994-5 were provided to EUROSTAT in October by the CSO for the calculation of regional comparisons.  The recent EUROSTAT results show that overall <Col N="752" /> Ireland was at 95 per cent of the EU average over the period.  These are the figures which are taken into account by EUROSTAT in the Objective One decision-making process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the Central Statistics Office supplied these figures to EUROSTAT, prior to the Government taking a decision to seek Objective One status for various regions? Surely the Government must have been aware of the break-down of the regional figures before making its submission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are provisional results for 1996 which are supplied in a routine manner. There were amended details for 1994 and 1995. These were provided to EUROSTAT in October for the purpose of regional comparisons in the EU.  That is a routine practice.  On the basis of the figures supplied by EUROSTAT, the combined Border, west and midland regions would be 72.3 per cent of the EU average.  The western seaboard, which includes Clare and Kerry, would bring the figure to 73.3 per cent.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate whether the EUROSTAT e-mail gave a break-down of the Irish figures on the basis of the eight existing regions and, if so, will he provide the information for each of the eight regions?  Given that the CSO provided information to EUROSTAT, did it provide county by county statistics and, if so, are they the same statistics which the CSO subsequently said were unreliable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO does not provide statistics county by county.  On the figures produced recently this was an exceptional measure. My information is that it did not supply those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics were produced on that basis for the eight regions and published on Friday, 27 November.  The statistics were based on the eight existing regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure for Ireland is 95 per cent of the EU average; for the Border region it is 76 per cent; for Dublin it is 122 per cent; for the mid-eastern region it is 79 per cent; for the midlands it is 66 per cent, for the mid-west it is 88 per cent; for the south east it is 87 per cent; for the south west it is 102 per cent and for the west it is 71 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that the CSO does not provide figures on a county by county basis.  How could EUROSTAT arrive at county by county figures if the Central Statistics Office <Col N="753" /> does not supply such data?  Surely the CSO has such information available to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>A later question deals with that matter.  In general the CSO does not calculate GDP figures for each county.  However, there was a recent exception to this which was prompted by a parliamentary question.  The CSO usually carries out its research in this area on a regional basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated that the figure for Dublin is 122 per cent of the EU average.  Do the EUROSTAT figures take account of the local development areas?  The figures for certain parts of Dublin are high but in other parts of the city, which are designated as disadvantaged areas on foot of criteria used by the Government and approved by the European Union, <i>per capita</i> incomes are low.  Do the EUROSTAT statistics for Dublin contain a breakdown based, for example, on the local development partnership areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, there is no such breakdown.  However, I will check that for the Deputy.  I understand that the figures are based on the region.  The CSO has made it consistently clear that, in terms of GDP, the figures become unreliable below sub-regional level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister forward that information to me if it becomes available to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  However, as far as I am aware, no such information exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister of State indicate that EUROSTAT provided its figures on a country-wide basis, on the basis of the eight regions and also on a county by county basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>EUROSTAT only provided them on a regional basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the gross value added figure?  I understand the Commission will be basing its decision on regional funding on this figure.  Was the GVA figure included in EUROSTAT's data?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the GVA figures in my possession.  However, I understand that they are comparable and of the same order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that certain incomes and subsidies are counted in the GDP figure which are not included in the GVA figure and <i>vice versa.</i>  The GVA figure for the Dublin region is substantially less than the 122 per cent figure for GDP and in the Border area this figure is substantially higher for a range of reasons.  This highlights the gross inadequacy of using this measurement for different regions and counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point. Question No. 11 asks whether subsidies are included in the <i>per capita</i> GDP for the six counties, etc., and I will provide more information when we come to that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Government supplied EUROSTAT with data which was collected on a regional basis, how can the Government make its application for Objective One status on a county by county basis?  If the figures for the three administrative areas in Cork were supplied to Brussels, it would become apparent why south-west Cork was excluded and Kerry included. Cork and Kerry have always been grouped for tourism funding purposes.  They have been partitioned by the Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 8, inclusive, and No. 80 together.</P>
      <P>The national millennium committee will examine and make recommendations to the Government on proposed millennium projects and on a system for supporting projects at local level to provide an opportunity for local communities, including areas of disadvantage, to participate in the millennium commemoration.  The work of the committee is being supported by a small millennium office which has been established within the Department of the Taoiseach.  This office will be responsible for the co-ordination of the Government's overall millennium programme.</P>
      <P>The Government has made Exchequer funding totalling £30 million available in the years 1999 and 2000 for millennium projects.  The Government intends that this fund will act as a lever on other sources of co-funding from the corporate and private sectors.</P>
      <P>The committee, of which I am chairperson, has begun its work.  The membership of the committee is as follows: Mr. Peter Barry, former Minister; Mr. Lochlann Quinn, chairman, AIB Group; Mr. Howard Kilroy, Governor, Bank of Ireland Group; Ms Eithne Healy, chairman, Dublin Theatre Festival; Ms Deirdre Purcell, journalist-author; Ms Patricia O'Donovan, deputy general secretary, ICTU; Ms Monica McWilliams, Northern Ireland Women's Coalition; Mr. Derek Keogh, chairman, Millennium Festivals Limited; Mr. Brian Murphy, chairman, Office of Public Works; Mr. Paul McGuinness, manager, U2; Mr. Ronan Keating, Boyzone; Mr. Joe Barry, former director-general, RTE; Mr. Paddy Duffy, special adviser to the Taoiseach; Mr. Eoin O'Leary, principal officer, Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The National Millennium Committee has met on two occasions to date, 19 November and 10 December.  A wide range of issues, including millennium themes, the millennium logo and proposed projects and events, was discussed.</P>
      <P>Among other matters, the committee has begun the task of examining millennium project proposals received, including the Liffey walkway, which is part of a number of projects proposed by Míle Átha Cliath.  A proposal for a Liffey valley national heritage park has also been received.</P>
      <P>At the first meeting of the committee, initial criteria for assessing project proposals were adopted.  These included the following: projects must be of national importance, although it is planned to develop local projects also; projects must arise distinctly from the millennium; and the objective is to fund projects on a 50-50 basis.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the opinions of Members of the House as to how we might proceed.  I represent many Dublin villages and I understand their problems.  We must be clear that the millennium fund is to be spent on celebrating the millennium.  Projects must be millennium specific.  The fund cannot be used as a top-up for projects specific to other Departments or which should be undertaken in the normal course by the Government or by local authorities. I am particularly sensitive to the role of Christian churches in the millennium.  I would be open to an approach from the churches.  I have had a meeting with the special religious liaison group.  I asked the churches to put together a liaison group to liaise with the national committee.  Its representatives include the Irish Council of Churches, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland, the Jewish community, the Islamic community and other churches.  I have had one meeting with them and will meet them again on Thursday, 17 December to discuss how the churches can commemorate the millennium in co-operation with the State.</P>

      <P>I note the Minister of State's reference to the national importance of a millennium project.  In that context, does he agree the Liffey valley is important, not only to Dublin and north Kildare but to the country generally?  It has often been compared to the valley of the Loire.  Does the Minister of State welcome the recent setbacks to developers in their attacks on the Liffey valley? I refer particularly to the defeat of the Laraghcon development and to last night's decision by South Dublin County Council to oppose development at St. Edmundsbury.  Will the Minister of State join me in congratulating the councillors who voted to preserve the Liffey valley and to attack those, particularly those in his party, who were of the opposite view?  Will he bring this project to the attention of the millennium committee? <Col N="757" /> It was supported by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  Will the Minister of State ensure it gets the support it deserves?</P>

      <P>Approximately £400 million worth of projects have already been submitted uninvited from Departments and from various other groups.  A number of them, although very fine projects, should be undertaken anyway and cannot be dealt with by the millennium committee because of the extent of its funding and because they are not millennium specific.  I agree the Liffey valley project is worthy of consideration and it will receive that consideration.  I do not have a comment on the other matter raised by the Deputy.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Can the Minister of State assure us a committee made up of a group which includes bankers, pop stars and music bosses will not present as the fruits of their labour another spike in, perhaps, Athlone?  Why are there no ordinary people on the committee given that projects funded by the committee should be of social benefit?</P>
      <P>In answering Question No. 8 concerning the Liffey valley park, will the Minister of State warmly welcome the decision by South Dublin County Council to reject the proposal to rezone extremely sensitive areas on the slopes of the Liffey valley at St. Edmunsbury, Woodville and Fonthill, for exorbitantly priced housing?</P>
      <P>Does he agree it is an oasis in the centre of the greater Dublin area and that we are fortunate to have that green belt for a significant part of the valley extending out to Leixlip preserved against repeated attempts by the speculator and the gombeen man to develop it?  It could be a major amenity and resource for the people of greater Dublin and the rest of the country.  It is crucial that the Government should move to preserve it from further speculative attack.  That would open up a green area along the river from Chapelizod to Leixlip to the ordinary people of Dublin and elsewhere in this State and to our visitors.  Will the Minister commit the Government to recommending such a project?</P>

      <P>Will the committee that has been set up be the decision-making body?  Is that where the buck will stop?  Could the Minister of State be more specific about the type of projects that will be considered?  What does millennium specific mean?  If he is not more specific, we will be inundated with suggestions and proposals.  To avoid putting people to unnecessary expense and then having to disappoint them, the Minister of State should be more specific about the type of projects that will be considered.  If we are approached on this matter, that would enable us to pass on the appropriate information.  Given the amount of money that is available, perhaps he could let people and groups know, through the media, what type of projects will be entertained, otherwise the £400 million worth of projects submitted will probably be only the beginning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the key question.  That is why we are deciding on the approach we will take to this matter.  It is not easy to say what precisely we should do, but it is clear what we should not do, and that is half the battle.  We want to make sure it is inclusive, that the Christian churches and other churches are involved and that it will look back on the millennium and also look forward.  There is much in the past 1,000 years and last century that we should not celebrate. We had world wars, outrageous barbarism and outrageous crimes against humanity.  The committee is particularly anxious that we should adopt the correct tone and approach to celebrating the millennium.  We should look at the past but we should also seek to generate a sense of excitement about the future.  We will invite proposals and assess if they meet the broad criteria of being millennium specific, if such a project would leave a lasting contribution for the next generation, achieve a sense of national ownership by ordinary people, as Deputy Joe Higgins would <Col N="759" /> say, and if it would be inclusive and non-divisive. Our initial view was that leaving monuments was not as important as leaving something more lasting and appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The CSO does not compile official statistics of GDP at county level because of some data inadequacies and the fact that such estimates are not meaningful for small areas.  However, as an exceptional measure, the CSO provided on Tuesday, 24 November broad indicative levels of GDP <i>per capita</i> in each county for 1995.  These estimates were subject to a number of qualifications.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office compiles a wide range of statistics on a county basis, including, for example, detailed information from the census of population, annual data on industry from the census of industrial production and detailed information on agriculture from the large-scale farm structure survey undertaken every two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the rate of participation in third level education in parts of Dublin is estimated at less than 15 per cent?  Is there a breakdown of the information the Central Statistics Office has been able to compile on a district electoral division basis so that the statistics are area specific?  The Minister quoted statistics for the whole of Dublin.  However, parts of Dublin are worse off than any other part of the country.  Does the Minister agree that we not only need statistical analysis on a county by county basis so that policy decisions can be made, but that it should also be available on a smaller unit basis so that counties such as Dublin can come to terms with the problems people face, such as lack of access to educational facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office is trying to provide meaningful statistics which allow the Government to make policy decisions. The national plan and Exchequer and other European funding is being targeted at the black-spots. We do not have GDP figures on a district electoral division basis as the distortions would be more troublesome than those on a county basis.  The new quarterly national household survey, which is undertaken by the CSO, is showing some interesting statistics.  It is a rolling programme which is beginning to be used in policy making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a belief that everyone in south Dublin is doing well?  I know there are serious problems in north Dublin, the inner city and in places such as Ballymun, Darndale, west Dublin, Tallaght and Clondalkin.  There is a perception that the south inner city is part of south Dublin which is doing well.  However, that is not the case.  Parts of the south inner city are as badly off as the areas I mentioned.  Does he agree that as legislators and policy makers we should have a breakdown of the statistics on educational facilities, housing, etc. when making decisions?  As the Minister responsible to the House for statistics, I ask him to look anew at the way statistics are compiled to ensure they are broken down, particularly in places as densely populated as Dublin, so that we can target resources at areas of need and that we do not imagine all the people south of the River Liffey are well off when they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That question was probably addressed to the right Deputy.  Anybody who has stood for election in Dún Laoghaire, Dublin South or Dublin South-Central knows that these are reputed to be well off areas, but there are substantial pockets of disadvantage throughout those areas which require attention.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked about more data on housing, educational disadvantage, educational attainment rates, etc.  All of that information is available and I can get it for him.  With regard to the numbers succeeding to third level above certain ages, the ratios and percentages coming from different backgrounds and housing, much of that information is now available in the quarterly National Household Survey.  It may not be available by district electoral division but it is certainly available by larger area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister stated the CSO view that the figures are not meaningful, is it not ridiculous to draw conclusions from them? There is a range of interpretations possible from these figures and from other data, such as the household budget survey which has the capacity to turn upside down the conclusions which are drawn.  County Wexford, for example, comes out as quite well off in these statistics, yet if one uses the household budget survey data it comes out as one of the poorest parts of the country.  South <Col N="761" /> Leinster fits into that category.  Are we just groping around in the dark?  Are we reaching conclusions which might fit an objective when there is a series of data available which would contradict the general tone what is being concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be clear that when we talk about statistics not being meaningful we are talking about the CSO's view that to measure GDP as a particular indicator on a county basis is not meaningful or reliable.  That is the opinion of the CSO.  The reason for that was explained in the House and publicly a number of times.  Where there are certain clusters of large industry, the pay packets may be in one county and the homes in another.  All these reasons have been thrashed out in the House and elsewhere.  It seems to have been accepted that to generate GDP figures on a county basis is difficult.  I assume the CSO will continue to work on trying to develop and perfect a system, but it only produced these figures on one occasion on an indicative basis.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's other question was whether these figures contradict other statistics.  There is a range of information produced on a county basis, such as the census of population, data on industry, and agriculture and farm surveys.  The quarterly national household survey produces such information.  Whether one can reconcile all of those with the GDP figure is obviously a question for the statisticians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply gives rise to all kinds of queries.  Why did the CSO issue figures which it subsequently stated were unreliable? Surely that undermines the credibility of the CSO.  It issued figures which were unreliable at a time when there was a major political debate about the veracity or otherwise of other statistics.</P>
      <P>Who made the decision that the CSO would publish such statistics?  Was it at the request of the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, who has overall responsibility for the CSO?  Was it a decision which they generated themselves in order to be helpful?  Given the inadequacy of the GDP and GVA figures which EUROSTAT is applying to our eligibility for Structural Funds, what statistics will the Government use to progress the national development plan?  If it bases them on inadequate EUROSTAT figures for planning purposes, the Government must have some other basis for planning.</P>
      <P>Given that the Government made the decision to include two additional counties in the application for full Objective One status, what statistics were used by the Government to establish Clare and Kerry's eligibility for inclusion?  What mechanism was used by the Government to strip out figures which it considered not to be applicable in the case of Clare and Kerry?  Why do those figures not also apply to Offaly, north Tipperary and other areas?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO issued these figures in response to a parliamentary question from <Col N="762" /> Deputy Quinn.  The CSO pointed out that it was doing so to be helpful.  I posed the same question. I would probably have thought that it was not a helpful thing to do.  However, the CSO is statutorily independent.  When the question was tabled the CSO informed me that it proposed to answer it in this way.  I did not interfere in that decision. It was a CSO decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the CSO is statutorily independent.  When a question is tabled seeking information, it is not the practice, whatever about the law, for the Minister to refuse to issue those statistics.  Being statutorily independent, the CSO can decide to respond to a parliamentary question and give the information it has always given.  That was my advice and I did not involve myself in this matter once the CSO had made its decision.</P>
      <P>I asked officials in the CSO why they were doing this and made the point that I believed it would be confusing.  I stated that if the CSO was of the view that the figures were not particularly reliable, it did not make any sense to produce them.  The CSO felt that Deputy Quinn's parliamentary question deserved a response.  I did not demur from that decision.</P>
      <P>I assume a broad range of figures will be used for the national development plan.  It will not just be GDP but the whole range of statistics available from the CSO.  Our main sources will be the CSO, the Central Bank and the development and State agencies.  It will be a broad range of statistics and not a narrow indicator.  It will come from across the system from State companies and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The western seaboard was measured as a region.  An earlier parliamentary question indicated that the region came out at or 72.3 per cent or 73.2 per cent.  The measurement was not county by county and tacked on.  The western seaboard was measured as a region.  On that basis it became the subject of the application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The Government continues to attach the highest priority to the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in all its aspects.  We are working closely with the British Government and with the political parties in Northern Ireland to ensure a full and speedy implementation of all the provisions of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>On 5 November, I told the House of the considerable progress which has been made in the implementation process.  This work is continuing. The Northern Ireland Act, which underpins in British legislation the constitutional, institutional, equality and human rights aspects of the Agreement, became law on 19 November.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told the House on 26 November of developments in this jurisdiction in the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Agreement, for which he has responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Patten Commission has conducted a series of public meetings, hearing the views of both sides of the community in the North on the future of policing.  The Criminal Justice Review and the International Decommissioning Commission are continuing with their work.</P>
      <P>We are all conscious that, despite sustained efforts on the part of both Governments and of the parties, it has not been possible to reach agreement in some other areas.  There is, as yet, no agreement on North-South implementation bodies and the issue of decommissioning, and the formation of the shadow executive also remains to be resolved.  As the Taoiseach has said, while it is most disappointing not to have reached a definitive conclusion on these matters, we must continue to seek a way forward.  We owe it to the people on this island, who voted for the Agreement in such overwhelming numbers, to make every effort to secure early progress.</P>
      <P>A substantial amount has been done at both political and official level on the North-South implementation bodies.  We are continuing to strive to conclude an agreement on these bodies as soon as possible, working constructively with the British Government and the parties in whatever way we can to achieve progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is crucially important that agreement is reached as soon as possible.  Even after agreement is reached, it will be necessary for the legislative and administrative arrangements to establish the bodies to be put in place so that they can &ldquo;go live&rdquo; and function alongside the other institutions under the Agreement when they come into force next year.  In the meantime, preparatory and co-ordination work is being intensified <Col N="764" /> at official level across the range of Government Departments.  I hope, with good will on all sides, we can reach agreement in the near future and then proceed urgently with the establishment of implementation bodies in the areas agreed.</P>
    <P>Meetings, both at political and official level, take place with all parties to the Agreement on a regular basis.  I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, in London last Thursday evening.  We reviewed the current situation in relation to the impasse over the formation of the Shadow Executive and decommissioning, as well as our efforts to agree the implementation bodies.  We discussed how both of us could best move these issues forward to ensure that the Agreement is speedily implemented.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, also discussed these matters in Washington last week with the White House, and with the Northern Ireland Political Development Minister, Mr. Paul Murphy.  The Taoiseach had significant discussions with the British Prime Minister during the European Council in Vienna last weekend.</P>
    <P>We have made good progress since 10 April in some areas but a number of challenges remain to be faced as we strive to implement the Agreement. The Government remains committed to ensuring that, building on the substantial work done to date, it can complete the task of implementation in a timely fashion.  In this way, we can ensure that the new beginning we promised to the people of this island on 10 April can be fully realised.</P>
    <P>I should mention that as we speak there are serious ongoing discussions taking place in Belfast on the North-South implementation bodies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister optimistic that the impasse he referred to on the Shadow Executive, decommissioning and the North-South implementation bodies will be broken this side of Christmas?</P>
      <P>Was the Government taken by surprise by the replacement of the IRA leadership, and does he read this as a hardening of the IRA position on decommissioning, or was this anticipated?</P>
      <P>Where now stands progress in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of Bunreacht na hÉireann?</P>

      <P>In relation to the first part of the Deputy's question, as I indicated in my reply, discussions are taking place as we speak in an intensive effort to achieve a breakthrough on the North-South bodies before Christmas.  We have to have hope.  Ideally these discussions should end before the week is out.  Government officials have been in Belfast since Sunday evening to facilitate this.  They have been staying in the closest contact with the Taoiseach and me throughout yesterday, including up to very late last night, and again today.  The Taoiseach and I and the Minister of State remain ready to travel to Belfast at the shortest notice if the timing is right and it is <Col N="765" /> believed it would be helpful.  Against this background of ongoing discussions which are delicate at this stage, Deputies will appreciate if I am unable to go into the kind of detail and substance which I would normally wish to in this House.  In advance of my coming into the House I spoke, at about 2.20 p.m., with the head of the Anglo-Irish section of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Belfast and with my good friend Mr. Séamus Mallon, who has invested so much time and effort in the negotiations and in trying to resolve the current impasse.  That is as much information as I can give to the House.</P>
      <P>Regarding the change of leadership by the IRA, it is not accepted practice for Ministers to comment on what the IRA might or might not do in the context of what the Deputy raised.</P>
      <P>In relation to Articles 2 and 3, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  In other words, all aspects of the British-Irish Agreement must be in place to trigger the implementation of the amended Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. Not until all aspects of the Agreement are implemented, not until the whole Agreement is seen to be in place, including the legislation to give effect to the various implementation bodies, can effect be given to those other areas that require legislation both in the British Westminster Parliament and in Oireachtas Éireann.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated in his initial reply that he had met Dr. Mo Mowlam last Thursday.  Does he intend to meet her again before Christmas with a view to moving the process forward?  We all agree that the intervention and involvement of the two Governments is crucial at this stage, given the impasse that has arisen.  Has the Minister anything to report to the House on a meeting between the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leader, Mr. Gerry Adams?  Has there been any progress in the publication of human rights legislation for this jurisdiction which is included in the British-Irish Agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>At my meeting with Dr. Mo Mowlam on Thursday night last in London in Admirality House, I had wide discussions with her on the current problems.  If necessary I will meet her before Christmas.  I am available at any time and any place, as is the Minister of State. We have very good relations with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and I pay tribute to her and her continuing involvement in the process and in the wish and will of all of us to conclude all the elements of the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the meeting between the Taoiseach and Mr. Adams, these meetings are ongoing.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach who has invested so much of his time and energy in bringing about a resolution, not only to this problem but to other problems which occurred in the past, as I have no doubt he will continue to do in the future.  He invests huge energy and time to achieve what we <Col N="766" /> all hope will be concluded in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>On human rights legislation in this jurisdiction, not only is draft legislation being prepared which is almost concluded but immense work has been done in other areas of prospective implementation bodies.  I have seen a memo to Government which this House would be proud of regarding the work put into it on a number of areas by our Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The Minister has informed the House that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  Is he convinced that Sinn Féin is aware of its responsibility as regards a commencement of decommissioning?  Is it the Government's intention to continue to release IRA prisoners at the rate at which they have been released?  Are further releases pending in the approach to Christmas?  Does the Minister expect a gesture from Sinn Féin in response to prisoner releases, given that it is accepted by all concerned that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed? Therefore, Sinn Féin should be presumed to be part of the direction in which the Irish Government and others are moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will continue to meet its obligations under the British-Irish Agreement.  The release programme will continue. As regards the solution to the current impasse on decommissioning, the Agreement is specific in relation to the timeframe in which decommissioning must take place.  In that context, two years is mentioned.  A great deal of work has been done by General de Chastelaine in his decommissioning body.  It is also interesting to note that Sinn Féin has appointed Martin McGuinness to keep in contact with General de Chastelaine.</P>
      <P>As regards Sinn Féin specifically, on the basis of the leadership shown by Mr. Adams and Mr. McGuinness, not only in the negotiations but since then, it is fair to say we continue to urge those with the knowledge and otherwise to bring about decommissioning sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>I have set out my views on the issue of Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace on a number of occasions in recent weeks &mdash; in reply to a question in this House on 5 November, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 28 November, in an RTE radio interview on Sunday, 6 December, and in reply to questions in this House as recently as 8 December.  I also expressed a point of view on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 11 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> My intention is to try to enhance understanding and informed discussion of the realities of PfP and also to move discussion away from the polarised views and slogans which seemed to me to characterise a good deal of such discussion as there has been about PfP, on either side of the argument.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the initiative earlier this year of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to devote attention to new developments in European security, including Ireland's possible participation in PfP, and I believe that the committee's deliberations have enhanced understanding of the issues within this House.</P>
    <P>I have already made my view publicly clear that participation in PfP is not the same as membership of NATO, as the participation of 27 non-members of NATO, including the other EU neutral states and Russia, should surely demonstrate. The case against our participation on grounds of neutrality is not persuasive.</P>

It is not my intention to prejudge or pre-empt this debate.  I am prepared to facilitate discussion of the issue, both in this House and more broadly.  I would be happy to have a debate on the issue in this House at a time to be agreed by the Whips.

We expect him, as Minister, <Col N="768" /> to lead the debate.  There has been no indication of that debate moving forward recently.  The Fianna Fáil Party's position before the general election and that of the current Minister and the former Minister indicate some differences of opinion.</P>
      <P>It is important this debate is held.  There are strong views on the issue inside and outside the House.  While the Minister has indicated his party's willingness to participate in the debate, I suggest the Minister lead by facilitating the debate and indicating to those inside and outside the House the Government's exact position on this issue.

      <Quest>if he has progressed proposals which seek the creation of a Dublin based European-North American, transatlantic foundation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read with interest the policy document prepared by Deputy Mitchell's party which proposes the establishment in Dublin of a foundation for transatlantic co-operation.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his courtesy in bringing this document to my attention.  He will recall that, in supplementary exchanges following my reply to his parliamentary question about EU-North American relations on 5 November, I gave him my preliminary reaction to the document, saying in effect that there was a great deal of merit in the proposal and that the location of such a foundation in Ireland would be advantageous.</P>
      <P>In view of the importance I attach to relations between Europe and North America, I am glad to have the opportunity today to comment further on the proposal.  Any serious proposals designed to strengthen the crucially important relationships between Europe and North America are worthy of close consideration.  One of my priorities as Minister for Foreign Affairs is to ensure that co-operation between Europe and the USA and Europe and Canada is reinforced and further developed.  To that end, and in close consultation with our EU partners, we will continue to be engaged in the ongoing transatlantic dialogue in an active and constructive manner.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there already exists a number of frameworks within which EU-North American relations are conducted, for example, the Transatlantic Economic Partnership and its associated Joint Action Plan which aims to accelerate economic growth through the reduction of technical barriers to trade, services and investment between the EU and USA.  There is a Joint EU-Canada Declaration and Action Plan which covers, among other issues, economic and trade relations.  Regular summit meetings between the EU and Canada and the EU and the USA are a distinctive feature of the strong relationships involved.  The next summits will be held in Ottawa on 17 December and in Washington on the following day.  The document provides a useful summary guide to these framework arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the document helps to stimulate a greater <Col N="770" /> public awareness of the importance of the transatlantic relationship as I believe it will, it will have made a worthwhile contribution to discussion of this question.  While I share the general aim inspiring the proposal, I feel sure the Deputy will understand that any new institution such as the proposed foundation should not duplicate the existing frameworks which already provide valuable channels for further developing the transatlantic dialogue.  Ireland is and will remain closely involved in promoting that dialogue through the EU agencies responsible for its conduct.  The proposal also contains significant financial implications which would have to assessed with care. One would need to be fully satisfied with regard to both of these factors if the proposed project were to be effectively advanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response to the policy proposal I have put forward seeking the creation of a foundation for transatlantic co-operation to be located in Dublin. The Minister will be aware that recent trade statistics show the continuing central importance of EU-US economic relations.  For example, two way trade represents about one-fifth of each others total in terms of goods and one-third in terms of services.  Furthermore, the US and the EU account for approximately half of the others foreign direct investment abroad.  The case is established for enhancing EU-US relations.  Does the Minister agree that given the pending enlargement of the EU Ireland's position will become effectively even more peripheral, that in terms of EU-US and EU-Canada development we will be centre stage, and that we should seek the creation of this foundation, located in Dublin, with a European &mdash; hopefully Irish &mdash; secretary general&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Does the Minister agree we should seize this initiative for the prestige of the country and so that we can build on the influence we already have with the US and Canada and at the same time enhance our continued role in the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's idea is good but its time has not yet arrived.  The essential thrust of the document is to promote closer transatlantic co-operation.  This is consistent with the policies of the Deputy's party and of Fianna Fáil.  The document presents the case for Ireland, in terms of its 25 years experience in the EU and its close ties with North America, as a location for the further promotion of EU-North American relations.  It contains a useful if necessarily brief summary of the existing network of transatlantic <Col N="771" /> relations, but the key element is the proposal to establish in Dublin a foundation for transatlantic co-operation.  The document views such a foundation as operating hand in glove with existing agencies.  Its remit would be to promote political, cultural, business, trade union, religious and other understanding and co-operation between the two continents.  However, there are difficulties with the proposals.  While I am advised that cost would be a difficulty I do not see it as such.  An annual amount of £500,000 is a great deal of money for me or the Deputy, but in terms of the country's overall net worth it is not a huge sum of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The St. Malo meeting has been presented, notably by the participants, as evidence of further convergence between France and Britain on the issue of European defence, but we should not overlook that those two countries which have permanent seats on the UN Security Council, which are the only two possessors of nuclear weapons within the European Union and which are prominent members of both NATO and Western European Union, have much in common and have long been close collaborators on defence issues.  My views on the issues raised in the questions are in the perspective of our membership of the EU, the effective functioning of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which it is intended will come into effect in May or June next year, and our non membership of any military alliances.  The agreements at St. Malo do not bind Ireland or anybody else in any sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that in recent months there has been renewed interest in the future of EU security and defence policy.  At the informal EU summit in Portschach in October there was discussion on enhancing the effectiveness of the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the face of crises such as at Kosovo, particularly if and when the United States does not wish to be fully engaged.  At the Vienna European Council last weekend, it was agreed to continue to reflect on <Col N="772" /> these issues and challenges.  The essential backdrop to these reflections is the imminent entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, under which the EU can use the Western European Union to undertake the Petersberg Tasks.  The Western European Union would, for its part, be dependent upon NATO for the infrastructural and resource support to undertake large scale Petersberg Tasks in accordance with arrangements between those two organisations which are expected to be developed and finalised in Spring 1999.</P>
    <P>In recent discussions at EU Foreign Minister level, and at the recent meeting in Vienna, I underlined the importance and priority of effective implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning the Petersberg Tasks, which were the result of an initiative by Sweden and Finland and fully supported by Ireland.  I emphasised that the emerging debate should proceed with respect for the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and that the specific positions of the neutral member states, including Ireland, should be taken into account.  These points are reflected in the presidency's conclusions from the Vienna European Council.  In particular, specific references to the position of neutral EU member states were set out at my request in the conclusions.</P>
    <P>Clearly we must be ready, willing and able to act constructively when faced with crises such as those in Bosnia and Kosovo which are European in origin and nature.  I accept the Franco-British view that the Treaty of Amsterdam will provide the essential basis for action by the Union.  I dispute any view to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Continuing reflections within the EU should include a rigorous analysis of what the EU collectively wishes to achieve under the Common Foreign and Security Policy and an analysis of how we can best use the Western European Union's crisis management mechanisms that are available to the EU in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>In giving my views on the St. Malo meeting it is relevant to recall that Ireland remains committed to progress in the field of disarmament and to the utmost restraint on arms exports.  I will continue to attach priority to disarmament as a foreign policy objective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  May I say by way of a preliminary introduction to my question that I welcome the debate on European Union security and defence?  It is inevitable that the European Union continues to deepen its integration and the question of defence and security will be critical for this country to address, as well as its role in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister concerned that the initiative by Britain and France, which are both nuclear powers, tends to indicate that they foresee a European defence architecture, to use the current buzz word, as being nuclear based and that their joint statement that the EU must have the capacity for autonomous action backed up by credible military <Col N="773" /> forces, the means to decide to use them and a readiness to do so is ominous to say the least? Both countries voted against the Irish motion in the United Nations calling for denuclearisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>To support what the Deputy said, I made a very strong intervention at a lunch at the General Affairs Council last Monday week. The thrust of my intervention was basically what the Deputy said.  I pointed out that we would have a difficulty with the elements.  This debate, if I may respectfully suggest, is at a very abstract stage and is not fully focused.  There are all sorts of subtexts not only in relation to defence and security, but also in relation to the armaments industry on which we have to be vigilant.</P>
      <P>I made an intervention using the same language as the Deputy in his question.  I made clear our view that future debate would be in the context of implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty provisions.  The Franco-British declaration is couched in very broad conceptual terms and does not contain specifics.  Whether or not the ideas of the authors may be followed up in the framework of Amsterdam remains to be seen.  We deserve and should request further information on all these ideas.  We can go along with discussion within the Amsterdam framework.  We sought the language of the Amsterdam Treaty and the Petersburg Tasks in the conclusion from Vienna and that is what we got.</P>
      <P>In my intervention last Monday week at the Foreign Affairs Ministers' luncheon, I pointed out that we are a neutral state, that NATO was nuclear capable and that we had launched the coalition initiative to which Deputy De Rossa referred for those states who want to see the total abolition of nuclear armaments once and for all to make this world of ours a safer place.  I am glad to say in relation to the latter that much progress has been made and will be made.  I am grateful to the Deputy for his question.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the genesis of Irish neutrality is partition and that our position in relation to security issues has become untenable?  Does he agree that a stranger looking at an aerial photograph of Strabane and Lifford could be forgive for mistaking them for the same town?  Yet Strabane has been in NATO since 1949 but, of course, Lifford is not a member.</P>

      <P>There is ongoing security co-operation between our excellent Garda Síochána and the RUC.  I do not envisage the type of scenario the Deputy set out in the context of North-South implementation bodies at this remove.  We are entitled to take a position in relation to our neutrality and not to become part of any military alliances.  This Government and I are committed to Irish neutrality.  There is no question of Ireland being forced into any action or arrangement against its will.  The position taken by the British and the French is abstract and conceptual and we need far more information on it.  My concern is to ensure all that is consistent with our neutral position.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to agree with the Deputy on one point.  We play a significant role in many organisations, either UN mandated organisations like SFOR in Bosnia or organisations like the OSCE and right across the spectrum of regional peacekeeping.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree the tradition and roots of our neutrality are much more complex than the issue of partition?  In any event, the question of the value, role and actual expression of Irish neutrality today needs to reflect the realities of this country, its membership of the European Union and its engagement on the European stage.  Bearing all that in mind and the constitutional provision which precludes us from joining military alliances, will the Minister indicate if he believes joining Partnership for Peace, a NATO-related organisation which requires a treaty of mutual interest, would also be contrary to our Constitution?</P>

      <P>I give an undertaking to the House once more that there will be a full debate in the House in advance of any decision to request membership of Partnership for Peace should that be decided upon.  I assure the House of that.  I agree with the Deputy that our neutrality is a very complex matter and is not related <Col N="775" /> to the ingredients set out in Deputy Mitchell's question.  As far as we are concerned, our neutrality is in good hands and it will be protected. Partnership for Peace has absolutely nothing to do with our neutrality.</P>

      <P>On my Question No. 57 which was taken with Question No. 18, does the Minister accept the point I made that partition is the genesis of our neutrality?  I accept there is more than partition involved and matters have moved on.  Sean McBride, his predecessor in that office, said we would become full charter members of NATO the day after partition ends and would seek to negotiate a bilateral defence agreement with the US.  Does the Minsiter agree, whatever about what has happened since, that I am accurate in saying the genesis of our neutrality is partition?  I accept that much has happened since to add to it and make it a more complicated issue, but it is the genesis of it nonetheless.</P>

Is he aware that, on 28 March 1996, the then Leader of the Opposition and now Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said that participation will be seen by other countries as a gratuitous signal that Ireland is moving away from neutrality and towards gradual incorporation into NATO and the Western European Union in due course?  Is the Minister also aware that the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, said at the time that any attempt to join PfP without a referendum would be a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic?  How can the Minister square that with his statement to the House today?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already indicated to the House my intention of visiting Indonesia in the coming months. An important objective of my visit is to meet the East Timorese resistance leader, Xanana Gusmao, who is currently imprisoned in Jakarta.  It is my intention during such a meeting to express my solidarity with the East Timorese cause and to encourage Xanana Gusmao to seek a peaceful, <Col N="777" /> negotiated settlement for the future of East Timor.</P>
    <P>In addition, I hope to take advantage of my proposed trip to Jakarta to hold discussions with the Indonesian authorities on the question of East Timor and other issues.  I expect to have the opportunity to express my concerns on human rights in East Timor, on the desirability of a reduction in the level of military forces in the territory and on the question of establishing a permanent UN presence in the capital, Dili.  I also propose to discuss the current unstable internal situation in Indonesia and the prospects for holding democratic elections scheduled for next June.</P>

      <P>When does the Minister hope to travel to Jakarta to meet Mr. Gusmao because the situation in that part of the world is becoming more urgent?  The East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign has continuously informed all Members of the ongoing situation in that part of the world.  Has there been contact regarding the assurances of the new Indonesian Government that the situation in East Timor will change?  It appears it has not improved and, if anything, has worsened.  Will the Minister indicate if there has been any ongoing discussion with the Indonesian Government or with the UN regarding the ongoing situation in East Timor?</P>

      <P>I have given an undertaking to the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign to visit Xanana Gusmao and that will be sometime in late spring. Much of my time and that of the Government is currently taken up with the need to keep a close eye on what is happening and what may happen in the Agenda 2000 negotiations.  It is hoped they will be completed by the end of March.  After that I will have an opportunity to visit Indonesia.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to priority Questions Nos. 13 and 16.</P>
      <P>The Government attaches the highest importance to the implementation of the North-South aspects of the Agreement.  They constitute an essential part of the overall balance of the British-Irish Agreement.  The Government has been actively involved in reaching agreement with the Northern parties, in consultation with the British Government, on identifying the initial areas for North-South co-operation and implementation. The Taoiseach and I, both directly and through our officials, have remained in ongoing contact with all the main players.  We will continue in our efforts to achieve early agreement in this area.</P>
      <P>Deputies have tabled questions about a number of specific areas of North-South co-operation, namely, arts, culture, Irish language and heritage issues and in energy matters.  These are all areas to which we attach importance in the context of the work of the North-South ministerial council, and possibly of the North-South implementation bodies.  Deputies will appreciate that, in view of the sensitivity of the discussions between the Government and the Northern parties, it would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on the individual areas in question.</P>
      <P>As we speak, there are serious ongoing negotiations taking place in Belfast on the North-South implementation bodies.</P>

      <P>During recent weeks and particularly since the round table talks with the political parties, the Taoiseach, I and the Minister of State, the whole apparatus of the Department of Foreign Affairs, specifically the Anglo-Irish section and of the Taoiseach's Department and other Departments which are required from time to time, have been involved in trying to resolve the impasse in relation to the problem of the implementation bodies, under the North-South ministerial council.  We are anxious to complete the <Col N="780" /> task we set out to do.  We hope it can be completed before Christmas.  On the question of contact between the parties, the Taoiseach, I and others have invested enormous amounts of time and energy in trying to resolve the detail of the issues involved.  In relation to the matters under consideration &mdash; I am grateful to the House for the manner in which it has met my request &mdash; it would not be appropriate for me to set out the implementation bodies under discussion.  If the Deputy looks at the annex under strand two, page 14 of the multi-party agreement document, she will get a flavour of what might be expected in the context of implementation bodies on an all-island basis and bodies for co-operation within each jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the sensitivity of the negotiations and I do not propose to probe in that area.  Has the Government given consideration to the legislation that will be necessary, even on a framework basis, which would end the signing off of agreement by all sides in relation to these cross-Border bodies?</P>

      <P>The legislation is ready to be taken immediately by the House in relation to whatever implementation bodies are produced at the end of the ongoing sensitive negotiations.  On Deputy Mitchell's question on RTE, I agree the signal going North is not strong.  That matter is being looked at.  It is an issue I have addressed and will continue to address.  The more information we can send North from this jurisdiction the better, in the context of what we all seek to achieve, peace on this island.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case; (1) Deputy Hayes &mdash; the need for the Minister for Health and Children to establish a national register of practitioners for acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine and to establish <Col N="781" /> national standards for the training of such practitioners; (2) Deputy Wall &mdash; the urgent need to address the serious shortfall in staffing levels in the Kildare Vocational Education Committee scheme; (3) Deputy Perry &mdash; the need to include additional district electoral divisions (details supplied) in County Sligo in the fodder relief scheme in view of the extreme hardship encountered by a vast number of farmers who reside in the excluded DED's.  Farmers from these regions are now forced to remove cattle from this area to cattle feeding sheds in County Kildare where lease rates can vary up to £8 per week per animal. Can the Minister now include these additional DED's; (4) Deputy Clune &mdash; the circumstances surrounding the death of a woman who was hit by a car driven by a person on temporary release from prison; (5) Deputy Ulick Burke &mdash; the need for the Minister to provide adequate resources and manpower in south Galway stretching from Gort to Kinvara and Athenry to increase a Garda presence in this area following recent alarming attacks within this area; (6) Deputy Fitzgerald &mdash; the reported attempted abductions of children in recent weeks; (7) Deputy Shortall &mdash; the urgent need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the action his Department has taken on foot of the revelations regarding the number of caesarean hysterectomy operations performed by an obstetrician in a certain hospital; (8) Deputy Farrelly &mdash; if the Minister will immediately provide moneys for the necessary work to St. Mary's special school Athlumney, Navan &mdash; following a decision by the fire officer of Meath County Council to close this school &mdash; so that children can continue to attend there.</P>

      <P>No. At the weekend a serious discrepancy emerged between figures provided by different agencies of the State in respect of the amount of money which will be on balance at the end of the year.  We are being asked to take without debate and with reference to one vote a number of Estimates, many of which could deal with additional moneys that may be required.  Before we agree to dispose of that item without a debate, we would like the Minister for Finance to inform the House if he has resolved the serious discrepancy of £1 billion between figures released by Dr. Michael Somers and those referred to in the Department's rebuttal press release on Friday.</P>

He will be in the House later to take a Bill on financial matters and I am sure he will take that opportunity to report on his meeting today with Mr. Somers.  I understand this matter may also be raised on the Adjournment this evening.  It would be more appropriate to deal with it at 6.30 p.m. when the Minister for Finance enters the House.

      <P>I am sure the Tánaiste will accept we are facing a serious situation because the agency with responsibility for managing the State's national debt is at odds with the Department of Finance.  There is a difference in policy between the NTMA and the Department and there is also a difference between the figures supplied to the House by the Minister and those released by the NTMA as the actual amount of revenue available to the Government in the coming year.  Does the Tánaiste agree the Minister for Finance should come before the House to make a statement and respond to questions?  An Adjournment debate is not an adequate way to deal with this serious matter.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition spokespersons and the Whips for facilitating the passage of the Bill today.</P>
      <P>Its essential purpose is the amendment and extension of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, 1997.  It increases payments into the fund for the year 1998 and extends the areas of research and development for which payments out of the fund may be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill represents an important route map for future investment in high level research in the third level sector.  In many ways it is a logical development to the provisions of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill passed by the House this time last year.  I say logical but not inevitable because while change is inevitable, progress is not.  Progress must be planned and it is the planned approach to investment underlined by the investment fund and <Col N="798" /> other important initiatives which has made this initiative feasible.  The original fund was a dramatic statement of the Government's commitment to look outside the normal paradigms for solutions to the ever present problem of funding for major initiatives in the third level sector.  It was a bold step which worked.</P>
    <P>The investment fund was underpinned by three key objectives.  First, we wanted to renew and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector and guarantee that they would continue to produce high quality graduates.  Second, we wanted to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs had already been identified.  Third, we wanted to invest in promoting the innovation which continues to be so crucial in maintaining and expanding our recent growth.</P>
    <P>A key supporting element in all this was the decision to invest in developing the technology and skills base of our first and second level schools.  At £250 million, the investment fund continues to represent the largest single capital investment programme ever introduced by a Government.  The sectoral allocations alone provide graphic evidence of the scope of the fund. These include £60 million for completion of the programme of skills development announced shortly after the Government took up office; £20 million towards a sustained programme of investment in the provision of hotel and tourism training facilities in the institutes of technology; £20 million for the vocational education sector, particularly post-leaving certificate courses and apprenticeships; £80 million for infrastructural developments, particularly the renewal and rein-vigoration of the technological sector as a crucial and distinct element of our binary system; £30 million for third level equipment renewal grants, which will tackle in a serious and sustained way equipment renewal in our third level colleges; £15 million for research and development and £25 million for the schools IT 2000 project, which affects both primary and second level schools. Deputies will be aware that the fund has already begun to have a major impact on institutions throughout the country.  At present, the largest building programme in the history of higher education is under way and facilities are being transformed. The institutes of technology are at various stages of the planning and design of projects which will address infrastructural deficiencies, provide facilities to meet skills needs and increase the provision of hotel and tourism training facilities in line with a programme of investment agreed with CERT.</P>
    <P>Projects involving capital expenditure of almost £90 million have already received sanction to proceed in Carlow, Cork, Dún Laoghaire, Limerick, Tallaght, Waterford and Blanchardstown Institutes of Technology.  Some £70 million of the cost will be met by the fund, with the balance coming from European Regional Development Fund and Exchequer sources.  Project evaluation <Col N="799" /> and consultation with interested parties is continuing and as further proposals are approved, the institutions will be authorised to proceed without delay with the implementation of the project.  The ongoing support of the Minister for Finance in this has facilitated the smooth operation of the programme and is greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>In the university sector, during the summer I was delighted to be in a position to allocate £30 million towards the creation of 3,900 additional undergraduate places to meet the skills needs of high technology industry.  This was a direct response to the skills needs identified as part of the Government's Action Plan for Skills and involved £4.5 million for phase II of the microcomputer building at UCD, £5 million for the extension to the O'Rahilly building at UCC, £4.5 million for an information technology building at UCG, £3 million for an extension to the Callan science building at St. Patrick's, Maynooth, £5 million for an informatics building at the University of Limerick, £5 million for an information technology building at Trinity College and £3 million towards the new computer science building and library at Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>The investment fund is unique because of the sheer scale of the investment and the fact that it has been aimed at skills needs in the science and technology area.  It is also unique in that it is parallel and in addition to the normal Estimates process. The £250 million initially envisaged for the fund is subject to Oireachtas control, and my Department will report to both Houses of the Oireachtas in detail before the end of March 1999 on the operation of the fund during the 1998 financial year.  However, the insecurity surrounding medium-term investment which comes from the often fraught Estimates process was avoided in this case by establishing the fund over a three year period with £250 million guaranteed.  This has underlined the Government's clear commitment to this type of investment and has sent a powerful message to private contributors that private donations to third level institutes would not be a substitute for public moneys but rather additional to an existing State investment which is substantial, visible and secure.  This is fundamental to fostering a climate of collaboration between the public sector and private industry in the area of education.</P>
    <P>The link between education and the material and social well-being of our people has never been stronger.  Private sector business and industry is set to benefit greatly from educational investment.  The continued success of the economy we have created is intimately bound up with our capacity to maintain a first class education system.  The education level of the national work-force represents the single most important factor in the development of the enterprise sector and in achieving ambitious targets for increases in employment and living standards, together with continued reductions in unemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The Government is determined that Ireland will maintain its place at the forefront of technological and business developments world-wide.  It would be wrong for anyone to understate the enormity of this challenge.  It would also be wrong to even think that we cannot do it because we have proven that we can.  The unprecedented growth in the economy in recent years has made Ireland quite simply the most dynamic economy in the most dynamic economic region in the world.  Deputies will know this phenomenon is the subject of admiration and even awe in respected business journals all over the world. What we must now do is prove that we can sustain and build on what we have achieved.</P>
    <P>Technological advancement is driving change in all sectors of the global economy at so fast a rate that to a large extent we must plan to cope with the unknowable.  This presents us with many challenges but also with enormous opportunities. Education is the key to realising those opportunities but let no one doubt that it will require mobilisation of all resources available to us and applying them together on a partnership basis to put in place the physical and personnel infrastructure necessary for continued success.  The successes of the recent past derive in no small way from the support given to the education system by private industry.  I appreciate the response of the private sector in supporting and developing this link with the State in providing the most modem facilities in our universities and colleges.</P>
    <P>Already it is clear that the issues to be confronted in further developing our education system for the next century will also have to be directly factored into our economic development plans.  In such circumstances partnership with the private sector moves beyond the realm of the desirable and becomes a strategic imperative for both parties.</P>
    <P>This dimension of partnership is an integral part of the investment fund and the Bill for the fund, as Deputies will know, provides for private contributions.  While contributions directly to the fund have not yet been received there is no doubt that the State's investment through the fund has stimulated interest and commitment.  It is worth noting that under the provisions of sections 489 and 843 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, private funds in the order of £50 million have been attracted into the third level system either through projects already sanctioned under the terms of the scheme or currently being processed.</P>
    <P>This new Bill amending the terms of the investment fund aims to marry the concept of public/private partnership with the largest ever investment in advanced research in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Why focus on advanced research?  Here, again, the answer is straightforward.  Maintaining and building on our recent success depends on our capacity to stay ahead of the competition.  This means Ireland's current attractiveness as a base for high-tech industry must be developed to include a high degree of strategic innovation.  It is essential that future graduates and post-graduates <Col N="801" /> can continue to meet and even surpass international research standards.  High quality research provides the environment for high quality teaching.  It also provides a catalyst for the type of innovation which an economy must have to sustain and expand economic growth.  It is not enough for us to exploit technologies developed elsewhere, we need to generate these technologies here and this cannot be done without a strong culture of research in higher education. We simply cannot have a cutting-edge economy without cutting-edge research.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussions with a wide range of people on this issue the essential point which kept coming through was that the most important thing Government can do is create an environment which enables institutions to develop and implement research strategies.  I was particularly impressed by the idea put to me that if Government demonstrated its commitment to significantly developing this area, institutions would be willing and eager to match our contribution. Three core principles arose from these discussions: existing current and capital provisions should be given certainty within a set programme; significant additional funding should be added; and transparent procedures should be established for allocating the funding which will guarantee that quality and strategic planning will be the only bases for decisions.  These principles provide the framework for the Bill before the House today.</P>
    <P>Under this programme, a total of £180 million will be provided over the next three years on research initiatives in third level institutions.  This integrated programme will be made up of £150 million for capital projects and £30 million for current expenditure.  The capital component of the programme will in the first instance involve £75 million of State funding to be generated by a mixture of dedicated funding from the investment fund, additional Exchequer funding to be transferred into the fund and tax reliefs.  Added to this will be £75 million which will be raised by the third level institutions themselves through donations and gifts relating to individual projects. The current funding side of the programme will include £15 million from the existing allocation for research within my Department's budget. Added to this will be a further £7.5 million direct Exchequer funding and a further £7.5 million to be raised by the universities.</P>
    <P>As demonstrated with the research funding programme run earlier this year, my only interest is the quality and strategic importance of research.  That is why I am putting in place an objective process for deciding on funding.  The assessment process will be carried out by an international group whose membership will reflect the full range of scholarly activity in science, technology, the humanities and the social sciences.  To be chaired by the Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, the panel will evaluate proposals on the basis of a rigorous evaluation framework.  Particular emphasis will be put on the contribution which the proposals made to promoting <Col N="802" /> the goals and objectives of the research strategy of the institution.  The other criteria will be research merit and the contribution of the proposals to the quality of teaching at all levels.  The assessment panel will be provided with the additional expert support needed.</P>
    <P>The administration of the programme will be carried out by the Higher Education Authority and, to ensure its smooth running, I have agreed to arrange the devolution of various key procedures to the authority.  These arrangements are in line with the Government's strategic management approach to capital projects and will be finalised before the end of January.</P>
    <P>The amendment Bill before the House contains only two sections.  Section 1 provides for an increase in payments into the fund from £100 million to £130 million for the 1998 financial year. This is clear evidence of the State's commitment to a substantial, visible and secure investment in the initiative.  The additional £30 million, together with £20 million already in the fund related to research and development and equipment, will provide the State's capital investment in the research initiative and will be supported by tax reliefs and £75 million in private funding.  Section 1 also broadens the scope of the Bill to include research in areas other than science and technology while maintaining the focus on these critical areas.  The humanities and social sciences fit within the broad approach of this initiative.  An intellectual culture, which encourages and supports critical inquiry across a wide diversity of fields, has clear benefits which reach well beyond narrow academic confines, especially in an era when prediction and uniformity are no longer possible.  Section 2 provides for an appropriate change in the short title of the Act.</P>
    <P>I recommend the terms of this amendment Bill. The necessity for the Bill is testament to our recent successes, but excellence is a journey and not a destination.  There is no standing still.  We must keep moving forward.  The initiative to develop research in higher education, as brought about through this amendment Bill, is the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, I welcome the announcement of the £180 million investment in research in higher education, but there are some disquieting aspects of it to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  The investment fund launched by the Government is intended to cover three years, so it is important that there are no mistakes in the implementation of the policy.  That could be disastrous for the Regional Technical College and institute of technology sector, restricting development in technological training which is so necessary for the generation of continuing employment in the areas concerned close to the colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area which would concern me is the matching funds requirement for the capital element. This means that colleges must find private sources for 50 per cent of the project costs.  Universities, for whom raising such funding is the <Col N="803" /> norm, have until June 1999 to convince the Higher Education Authority that funds can be raised.  However, new colleges must provide convincing evidence by February 1999 and they have no track record in raising funds.  This means these colleges will have greater difficulty in raising funds as greater recognition is given to universities. Institutes of technology who are new to raising funds will find it more difficult.  The timescale is shorter for institutes, blocking them from receiving the funding they need to develop research and development facilities.</P>
    <P>Only 50 per cent of third level students attend universities.  These students will have the majority of resources for capital research and development investment.  This will perpetuate the social imbalance in the system.  The institutes of technology will find it hard to catch up with universities as they are new to raising funds from private investors. Many universities have people whose sole role is to raise funds.  Institutes of technology need more time to raise the matching funds.  The time allowed should equal that given to universities.</P>
    <P>The Bill uses the term &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; in an area of education, including scientific and technological research and development.  The Taoiseach constantly uses the phrase &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; which indicates the Government's view.  However, this includes applied as well a pure research.  The Higher Education Authority excludes research which might be regarded as close to commercialisation or the market.  There is a major difference.  The term &ldquo;research and development&rdquo; is not used by the HEA, demonstrating a difference in opinion from the Government and indicating a bias towards universities.</P>
    <P>The Minister alluded to our economic success having been built on the availability of skilled manpower.  Many industrialists who have come to Ireland have been influenced by the availability of graduates from Regional Technical Colleges and institutes of technology.  However, the guidelines are written for universities.  Too much trust may have been placed in the HEA.  To achieve a balance between institutes and universities it is important that this fund is equally and fairly distributed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation is mentioned in the guidelines as being a technology think tank.  However, institutes of technology have been excluded from this body.  This means that the 50 per cent of third level students who attend institutes of technology are being excluded.  Many of these institutes feel that they may have difficulty accessing this fund. Everyone welcomes the additional spending on research.  The Exchequer is offering an additional £75 million in capital spending but we are only voting on £30 million in the House.  Much of what was announced with such a fanfare is existing spending.</P>
    <P>On the current side, spending of £30 million <Col N="804" /> was announced.  However, only £2.5 million of this figure is new money.  The committee for selecting projects should be given statutory expression in the Bill.  There should also be strong industrial representation on the committee.  It is critical that the chairperson should be a prominent international business person.  Why is the Vote being rushed through in 1998 when no projects are awaiting funding and when no funding has been drawn down?</P>
    <P>Is the £100 million already allocated in 1998 trying to create a misleading picture of the true Exchequer spending?  It is disappointing that no private money has been contributed to the fund. Obtaining private money was a key element of this fund but it is proving difficult to secure this money.  The fund is very large and will do much for the education system over three years.  When will the money be spent?  Will the spending be higher in the final year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Why were the promised procedures of the Higher Education Authority not circulated before the Bill was introduced? This would have helped.  Where are the promised guidelines for spending projects?  The commercialisation of research is very important for research and development.  Does the Minister intend to broaden the format for science and technology?  Will the research money be spent only on universities and institutes of technology or, for instance, can a private professor apply for funding?</P>
      <P>The Business Education Forum recently reported to the Minister.  The forum has forecast that the demand in the technology sector for professionals and technicians will be in excess of 8,100 people per annum in the period 1999-2003. The estimated current supply is 6,100 &mdash; a shortfall of 2,200 per annum.</P>
      <P>The former chairman of the IDA, Kieran McGowan, indicated that in the future Ireland will be trying to attract highly-geared companies. These companies will need highly-educated graduates and we must ensure we have the supply to meet the demand.  We will be more selective in the companies we try to attract to Ireland. Fruit of the Loom came to Ireland at a time when costs were lower.  We are now a high-cost economy and we are looking for highly-qualified graduates who can take these jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supply estimate includes not only graduates, but returning emigrants and immigrants with the required skills, and the up-skilling of existing employees through concentrated, in-company and part-release training.  The shortfall of 2,200 per annum is based on a high-demand scenario. If Ireland's economic growth remains positive, expansion in the technology sector will continue at the pace of recent years.  The recommended <Col N="805" /> actions are needed to ease the skills constraints in this sector.</P>
    <P>The 2,220 shortfall is an average for the period 1997-2003.  Output has fallen behind this requirement in the initial two years of the period.  Even the increased intake in degree courses in 1998 will not result in an increased output until 2002.  Meeting the output target will be difficult.  Additional funding has been allocated to universities and institutes and matching funds are being sought for research and development.  Companies will go to where there is a well-managed university or institute with a good research and development facility.  Technology companies need that reassurance. Ireland has a high standard of education. Detailed forecasting of skill requirements for some sectors of the economy is a very difficult exercise and there are significant margins of error.  The supply will not come fully on stream for up to four years for degree graduates.  In contrast, most businesses would have difficulty in forecasting their demand for labour any further than two years into the future.  This is particularly true of the technology sector, given the rapid pace of innovation.  Research and development is changing, particularly in the food sector.  Ireland is a growing economy.  To ensure future growth in employment and create jobs in each area the Minister must ensure that the colleges and universities look to the year 2005.  From that point of view, the Minister is looking into a crystal ball.</P>
    <P>The report recommends meeting the potential skills demand of the high-growth scenario, based on argument that the economic costs of potential inadequate supply are less than the costs of potential excess supply.  There is a world-wide skills shortage in the technology industry and if we can supply the required skills in sufficient quantity, this would give Ireland a significant competitive advantage in attracting investment from multinationals.  We need to encourage people to go from second level to third level education in universities and institutes of technology. The problem is that people are dropping out after the first or second year, attracted by employment. It is important to sell the message that there is a guaranteed job for people who finish their courses.  People who go to college, particularly the institutes of technology, become disillusioned and drop out after a year and a half or two years because they have been offered a job at £300 a week.  If they could be encouraged to obtain their degree, even over a longer period, as a part-time student, in time they could avail of the high-tech jobs that I have no doubt will come on stream if we can say that we have educated youth coming on stream.</P>
    <P>Expanding the education infrastructure will be expensive.  What the Minister is starting here today is critical for Ireland's success in the future. For every science and engineering graduate qualifying annually, the number of places in third level establishments needs to be increased by a factor in excess of four.  Most courses take four years to complete and the completion rate &mdash; those <Col N="806" /> entering first year who graduate with a degree &mdash; is just 80 per cent.  The report estimates that an extra output of 500 professional graduates from third level institutes is required to meet the shortfall of 900 professionals.  The remaining 400 will come from employee up-skilling and conversion courses.  This will require the provision of an extra 2,120 university and institute of technology places.  Similarly, an extra 1,700 places are needed at technician level.</P>
    <P>The policy recommendations in the report focus on the need to ensure that resources allocated to education and training provide a maximum return.  To this end, the training programmes should be demand-led, with a significant input from business.  We have a unique opportunity to get the £75 million in respect of private business, and every encouragement should be given to these businesses.</P>
    <P>The report also states that 85 per cent of the technical and 50 per cent of the professional skills shortfall will need to be provided by industry-led initiatives.  In the context of research and development within companies it is important that while institutes are given research and development facilities, companies should be invited into the universities because the partnership of business and education is the way forward to ensure that companies coming into Ireland can retain jobs by developing employee skills.</P>
    <P>To achieve this, there will need to be greater integration between business and the education and training sector.  The Business, Education and Training Forum is one part of this process. Already there have been a number of initiatives where business is training its own people at local educational establishments.  Companies that are recognised by educational establishments locally should be encouraged to promote business by allowing people to be involved in education while they work.  The Expert Skills Group sees these developments as models for extending the integration of business and education.  The right incentive to business people to invest money in educating their employees will ensure that there are sustainable jobs that will remain here.  That is where the real growth is.  This applies particularly to Irish products in the context of the development of own brands.</P>
    <P>The facility of an institute to develop skills is crucial because many companies have fantastic products but do not have the facilities or the cash to appoint a researcher.  If integration of the business community with the educational sector within an area could be achieved, working on research in the context of any product, an unbelievable number of sustainable jobs could be created.  The technological sector is a huge growth area, but research and development is important to Ireland's success in the future.  We have seen the success of small companies from humble beginnings producing very successful product ranges solely as a result of working in partnership with an educational institution which was prepared to help.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> It is good to see this money being allocated.  I welcome the fund.  From the turn of the millennium and beyond Ireland will be rightly recognised as having a very good education system. The fund will enhance that considerably but I have one concern.  I was informed by the institute in Sligo that the closing date that applies to is February and that the universities have until the end of the year to qualify for capital allowance in respect of raising capital funding.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  It is important that the Minister should encourage institutes of technology because much of this is quite new to them whereas the leading universities have been fund-raising for a considerable period.  If the institutes of technology are treated similarly to the universities the scheme would be much more successful. I am delighted to have had the opportunity to speak on this.  I thank Deputy Bruton for giving me the opportunity.  There is huge potential for development in this area.</P>
    <P>On a different note, the Minister's announcement on Carrowreagh School on the Adjournment last week, which has averted a boycott of the school, was very welcome in south Sligo and deserves to be acknowledged.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm seans a fháil labhairt sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo, cé go bhfuil an Bille um an gCiste Oideachais Eolaíochta agus Teicneolaíochta (Infheistíocht) (Leasú), 1998, gearr a dhóthain.  Beidh Pairtí an Lucht Oibre ag tabhairt tacaíocht don Bhille agus níl sé ar intinn againn ag an nóiméad leasú a chur síos.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which, although a small one, relates to a very important area surrounding not only our education system but the entire economic system. The Bill deals with three areas.  I am pleased with the citation.  It is a good idea that we put Bills together as it makes it easier for everyone when trying to research legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the wording refers to &ldquo;any area of education&rdquo; in which research and development can be carried out.  The education system has a fundamental difficulty at present. Last week I was shocked and surprised to hear the agricultural sector is encountering some difficulties as regards qualifications because of literacy problems.  These problems are becoming evident in many areas.  When we cite the figure of 25 per cent illiteracy among the population, that does not mean that 25 per cent of the population cannot read or write.  However, it does mean they <Col N="808" /> do not have sufficient literacy skills to cope with employment.</P>
    <P>There is a need for educational institutions to focus more research on literacy, the psychology of education, and a number of conditions which I have raised on many occasions but which continue to concern me &mdash; dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD and ADHD.  The research which needs to be carried out may require involvement with other Departments in properly exploring and identifying trends.</P>
    <P>Nowadays, there are also a number of families with what is called &ldquo;dysfunction&rdquo;.  This area requires a great deal of examination.  Going hand in hand with that is a changing social order.  Single parent families are becoming more of a factor in our society.  We need to monitor social change as it affects our educational system.  This needs to be done on a contemporary basis and not retrospectively. We need to measure and track what is happening and identify best practice in dealing with the difficulties which now arise more in our schools.</P>
    <P>If we are to maximise our economic output and raise the skills level in our economy, which every Deputy supports, something substantial needs to be done about adult education and literacy in particular. I compliment the Minister on recent steps taken in that regard and I welcome the publication of the recent report.  However, we need to find the root causes and discover why there is such a high rate of incompetence in these areas.</P>
    <P>This did not happen overnight and we are not in the business of trying to apportion blame. However, there is a problem.  A high level of quality research needs to be carried out on problems such as literacy, especially on the scale we seem to be encountering . First, we need to identify the reasons and then ascertain the causes. Some research suggests that up to 10 per cent of the population should be tested for conditions such as dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADD etc.</P>
    <P>I do not have the answer to this problem. However, we do not seem to have the repository of expert knowledge of these conditions in the State.  We need to develop this rapidly.  It seems that young people with these conditions, ADD in particular, fail at school, their behaviour can become quite challenging and they can fall out of the system.  It is not recognised that the problem relates to an inherent difficulty.  Their conduct is often put down to the child being bold or uncooperative. This is a real crisis.</P>
    <P>Investment in research and development and science and technology is welcome.  As the Minister said, if we have a cutting edge economy we also need cutting edge research and development. However, we cannot and should never ignore the social problems which exist.  Many people are emerging from our educational system unable to participate in the full range of benefits of the tiger economy.  The Minister should develop this area to a maximum so that those who are failing are helped and that we also begin to identify where <Col N="809" /> they start to go wrong so that the necessary remedial action can be taken early.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification on some provisions.  Section 4(5) of the principal Act mentions guidelines.  The Minister, to the best of my knowledge, has not yet provided any guidelines on the disbursement of funds.  On the question of patents, for example, if an institute makes an important discovery which requires a patent on which substantial royalties could accrue, to whom will those royalties be paid under present legislation?  I raised this question last year on the earlier legislation.  My problem is with what happens when a campus company carries out the research and development and makes an important discovery.  This company is a limited liability company, for good reasons, because if something goes wrong, the main institution will not have to pick up the tab in the event of a substantial loss.  Have the legal issues been worked out?  I hope research will produce worthwhile and unique results and break new frontiers.  Who benefits when new discoveries are made?</P>
    <P>When I was responsible for the food industry as a Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, it was clear to me we have a substantial amount of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; in terms of research and development.  Funding was the problem and in that context I welcome this Bill. For example, the dairy science faculty in UCC has come up with products which were marketable. The two major products of agriculture are milk and beef.  Beef is at its most valuable in its raw state, with its value added side arising from cheaper cuts.  It is very different from milk which is probably at its least valuable in its raw state.</P>
    <P>We are still not developing a sufficient number of value added products.  We are still commodity producers.  When one examines the background to the problems currently being experienced by agriculture a clear pattern emerges.  The type of holding which will be viable in the future will be larger.  If certain levels of holdings are to survive there must be off-farm income which must be gained through the manufacture of value added products which introduce a new dimension and means of wealth generation.</P>
    <P>There are areas in the economy which must be targeted.  Sometimes when we talk of science and technology people get the wrong idea and think we are talking about information technology and engineering.  We should not lose sight of the fact that we produce basic agricultural materials to a very high standard and we must capitalise on them.  When I was in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry my view was that very little real research and development was being undertaken, that perhaps there was some research and development which touched up products close to the market, but that the fundamental research which brings about new products which break new markets was not being undertaken to a sufficient extent.  Good work was being undertaken, but not to a sufficient extent. Research and development is very important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="810" /> The social side of research is very important and should be developed.  We should very much focus on rural areas in terms of the type of research and development being carried out. More especially we should look at research and development which can lead to more consumer and value added products which will open new markets and opportunities for employment.  This will also help arrest the current situation which is dismal enough in terms of the future of people in rural Ireland.  There are many ways in which we can look at this issue.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and wish the Minister well with the implementation of the fund.  It is a very important area and one which requires our best efforts and all possible resourcing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Shea for sharing time with me.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on the initiatives he has taken in this area.  I have no hesitation in supporting the Bill as the provision of additional funding for scientific and technological education is important both for the education system and the economy.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister stated &ldquo;the Government is determined that Ireland will maintain its place at the forefront of technological and business developments worldwide.  It would be wrong for anyone to understate the enormity of this challenge.&rdquo;  I certainly agree with the Minister in this.  To some extent we have developed a degree of self assurance and almost cockiness about our position at the leading edge of technology, skills, etc.  We have developed a self image that we are very technologically advanced and capable of attracting the most highly sophisticated employment and economic initiatives, particularly in the information technology sector.  We must reflect a little on the requirement that we are going to have to keep up with the race, that it is necessary to continue a process of research, innovation, investment and education.  If we do not do this the pre-eminent position we like to think we have achieved can slip away very quickly, with dramatic and speedy consequences in terms of economic activity and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of warning signs are beginning to emerge that we are not quite as good at keeping up with scientific and technological developments and education as we like to think.  A number of indicators are coming from employers and employer organisations regarding the shortage of skills and the difficulty experienced by new industries in securing sufficient numbers and sufficiently trained employees.  Perhaps the most worrying development in the education system for some time is the decline in the number of pupils at second level taking science subjects at leaving certificate level.  Earlier in the year the Minister commented on the decline in the numbers taking chemistry, physics and other science subjects.  We must examine this area as a matter of urgency to find out the causes of this.  Is it a problem with the curriculum?  Is there a problem <Col N="811" /> in relation to examinations and the perceived difficulty of science examinations?  Is there a problem with the way in which science subjects are being taught?  In saying this I am not casting a reflection on the quality of teaching or the commitment of science teachers.  Is there a problem in the number of people with science degrees who are taking up teaching?  Obviously, given the changes and advances in the economy, there are attractions and opportunities open to science graduates outside teaching which may now be attracting many who otherwise and in different times would pursue a career in teaching.  Is there a problem in the provision of resources, equipment and laboratory facilities in second level schools?  These issues must be urgently addressed as otherwise the provision of money for research and innovation at third level will not make up for the loss at second level.</P>
    <P>In this context a report was produced this year by Forfás in relation to science in primary schools and I urge the Minister to implement it recommendations. Clearly, if pupils are introduced to science at primary level they will have a grounding in it on going into second level.  Perhaps that may in turn be reflected in the numbers taking science subjects and the interest in such subjects as pupils go through the second level system.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the PLC area in passing. Earlier in the year he promised that grants to PLC students would be paid in January.  Many PLC students are from low income backgrounds and are already under severe strain financially and I urge him not to delay in the payment of PLC grants in January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo.  It is straightforward but very important in that it enhances the Government's and the Minister's commitment to investment in scientific and technological education by allowing an increase in the fund from £100 million to £130 million in the 1998 financial year.  This fund when seen in conjunction with the £250 million allocated over three years to the education and technology investment fund represents an unprecedented investment in developing a crucially important area of education.  It has begun to fund new facilities in institutions and will keep Irish education at the cutting edge of international developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also worth noting that the Government recently announced a package of £180 million over a three year investment programme for scientific and other research in universities and third level colleges.  These funds will be spent on capital and current investment with £75 million of the funds being raised privately by the colleges. This private-public initiative is most welcome and I give credit to the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy and the Taoiseach for launching this fund.  The specific funding for research and development in third level institutions is most important.  Funding is also being provided for a <Col N="812" /> major programme of equipment renewal in colleges. This year there will be more research and development activity in Ireland than ever before.</P>
    <P>This Bill should also be viewed in the context of the information technology 2000 programme which is up and running and has trained 9,000 teachers.  It is an excellent example of the private sector joining the Government in crucial areas of investment.  For example, Telecom Éireann is investing in excess of £15 million in the project while a pilot project is in operation with IBM.</P>
    <P>I stress the importance of giving priority to training remedial and resource teachers in scientific and technological education.  It is certainly welcome that extra teachers are appointed for children with special needs.  Last week 16 schools in County Galway were approved to share resource teachers and there will be extra hours for some students.  Some of the schools involved already had resource teachers which is most welcome. I stress the importance of computer skills for resource and remedial teachers.  It is not good enough to say there is a teacher on the panel who has been appointed as resource or remedial teacher, when computer skills are most important for the teacher to be appointed as well as the desire to be the special needs teacher.</P>
    <P>I also mention the need for more equipment for special needs children.  Many of the children in my constituency have been approved for this equipment but there is still a delay in providing it. That should not be the case because the Minister provided £400,000 for the purchase of equipment for special needs children.  Indeed, a point made to me recently by the Galway branch of the INTO related to the need to give priority to special education.  It stressed the need to reduce the pupil teacher ratio where there were special needs pupils.  That is very relevant in the context of using new technology.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science saw the benefit of a favourable pupil teacher ratio when they visited Norway last October.  We also saw technology used for special education.  In a particular state school for the deaf which Deputy Naughten, Deputy O'Shea and I visited, we saw that each child had a personal camera and video on which to practice sign language.  That is the type of education to which we would like to aspire.  In Norway up to 7.6 per cent of gross domestic product is allocated to education compared to the OECD average of 4.9 per cent.  I hope the Minister is pushing up our average GDP spend on education with the money he is able to get from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of this Government's approach to the education system has been investment in technology and technological development.  The schools information technology 2000 programme which will run over three years with public investment of £40 million is being run as a national partnership involving schools, parents, local communities, third level colleges and public and private sector organisations. <Col N="813" /> I understand that by the year 2001 some 60,000 multimedia computers will be provided to schools and Internet access to every school will be completed.  At least 20,000 teachers will receive training with a curriculum support structure based on a national network which will be in place.</P>
    <P>The National Policy Advisory and Development Committee, the NPADC, has been set up to oversee this project and it directly advises the Minister, who is in the process of recruiting 20 ICT advisers.  The commitment to ensuring that every child is given the opportunity to experience and use information technology in the class room is becoming a reality under this Government.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill, I am glad the Minister also announced an initiative to promote reading in schools.  He recently announced £6.5 million for school library books.  That will certainly improve reading levels in schools and it is something about which we should not forget with all the talk of technology.  Each primary school will receive a minimum of £1,000 each and second level schools will receive £2,500.  Increased grants for first and second level schools will be paid where there is a designated disadvantaged area scheme.</P>
    <P>Scientific and technological investment in education is vital if this country is to continue its increased economic success, which this Bill will certainly enhance.  The Minister should look at the situation of buildings in third level institutions. Many lectures in our universities, institutes and third level colleges are still held in prefabricated buildings.  An example of this is the NUI in Galway where new buildings are badly needed.  Will the Minister investigate colleges like Galway which are in need of new buildings?  We have seen demonstrations and sit-ins in many of our colleges, particularly as regards library facilities. If we are to increase payments to the scientific and technological education fund, we also need to provide buildings for the new equipment and technology about which the Minister spoke.</P>
    <P>During the summer the Minister allocated £30 million towards the creation of 3,900 addition undergraduate places in the university sector. That was done to meet the skill needs of the high technology industry.  Obviously, if extra places are being provided, we need buildings for equipment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that under section 4, funding is provided for areas other than scientific and technological research.  For example, the humanities and the social sciences were mentioned by the Minister.  I very much welcome that part of the Bill which shows that the Minister is keen to make progress in this area and is not confining the Bill to scientific and technological education. I welcome the increase in funding and commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle of the Bill.  I have a vested interest in this as I am theoretically still a postgraduate research student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I take issue with Deputy Kitt's point about the Minister providing funding for the humanities and social sciences.  The Minister should visit UCC where the arts faculty does not even have rooms to hold tutorials, an integral part of any undergraduate arts course.  He should open his eyes to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of providing for investment in equipment.  Many third level colleges have glass pipettes in teaching labs for undergraduate courses, and these cause numerous accidents each year.  Colleges cannot afford plastic pipettes because they cannot be reused.  Accidents occur every week in third level colleges because of the lack of a basic piece of equipment for which there is no funding.  I have experience of it, having spent four hours in surgery receiving 18 stitches in my hand because I ended up on the wrong side of a glass pipette.  The Minister should ensure basic funding is provided for small pieces of equipment.</P>
    <P>I hope both he and the Minister of State present will ensure more funding is provided for the Institute of Technology in Athlone, an institution which is close to the Minister of State's heart.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the principle of the Bill, I am critical of the manner in which the funds are allocated. The investment provides for applied research, but current State investment fails to recognise the need for basic research which has been the backbone of developing applied research.  For example, research in the area of genetics has allowed the cheese industry to work more efficiently.  Funding must be provided for basic research to develop new products and services. The Government has failed to realise this and is only providing funding for applied research.  That is all well and good for today but the future must be considered.  The Government has no idea how it will plan research in future.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the House, I wish to share my time with Deputy Enright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The current economic boom is partly based on basic research conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  It encouraged many multinational companies to locate here.  Areas of scientific expertise have now been developed in many universities.  For example, UCC has specialised in the food area, UCD in agriculture and veterinary medicine, Trinity College in genetics, especially human genetics, and UCG in identifying new diseases.  While huge developments have occurred, the standard of expertise will fall if adequate funding for basic research is not guaranteed.  New areas of expertise cannot be developed without funding and this has been refused.  The State is failing to provide funding for the development of projects in their infancy, even though they may be the science of the future and may provide employment.  The software and information technology industries exist today <Col N="815" /> because of investment made a number of years ago.  The allocation of funds for the future must be examined.  Concentration on day-to-day research is not enough; it must be long-term. Sadly, this fund fails to do that.</P>
      <P>It is pointless to speak of scientific investment if students are not encouraged to study science at second level.  The courses are obsolete.  The biology course is almost 20 years old.  On my first day in UCD, in October 1991, my biology lecturer looked at the book I had studied for two years previously and threw it in the bin.  She told me to forget anything I had learned from it.  Seven years later, students are stilll studying this outdated baloney.  It is very difficult to encourage students to study science when what they learn in second level is obsolete by the time they enter third level. Nothing is being done about this, although the Minister spoke of introducing a new curriculum. How long more must we wait for it?  It should have been introduced years ago.</P>
      <P>The science subjects of biology, chemistry and physics are all practical, yet students are not assessed on the practical element but on the theory. Science is not a theoretical subject.  Once students enter first year in college, they must undertake the practical element which accounts for 40 per cent of marks on a continuous assessment basis.  However, when they sit the leaving certificate, it is all theoretical and no marks are allocated to the practical element.  Laboratory facilities in our schools are a joke.  Chemicals are not stored correctly and there are no facilities and no laboratory space.  How can young people be encouraged to study science when they are expected to learn it from a book without practical work.  I spent two years studying biology and physics in secondary school without any practical work.  It is difficult to encourage young people to study a so-called practical subject when it is not taught as such at second level.</P>
      <P>There is a serious problem in third level colleges in trying to encourage graduates to conduct research, especially at doctorate level.  This is because they are paid a paltry £65 per week for four years.  They would receive more signing on for social welfare payments than conducting research which is supposed to be the backbone of the economy and which the Minister claims is badly needed.  There is a skills shortage and research must be conducted to develop new products.</P>
      <P>People then wonder why, when post graduate students receive their degrees, they emigrate. What would one expect them to do?  They should be properly paid and recognised because they can obtain better paid jobs outside third level institutions. If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys. Such students should be given the basic minimum wage.  The Minister has no intention of paying it to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for 50 per cent of projects to come from private sources.  Will the Minister explain why private industry should provide funding <Col N="816" /> for scientific investment when it has never done so in the past and has never had any intention of so doing?  Irish industry has the worst record of developed countries in providing funding for research.  It will never invest in basic research but rely on EU funds.  The Minister should examine these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for sharing his time with me.  I welcome this important Bill.  It is essential that greater emphasis is placed by the Department of Education and Science on ensuring a science subject is taught in primary schools.  More senior people than the Minister of State will recall that science was taught in primary schools in Ireland in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.  I regret that no longer is the case.  I am saddened at the lack of facilities for teaching science in post-primary schools.  Deputy Naughten rightly criticised the appalling lack of facilities for practical experiments.  It is essential that science rooms are upgraded and modernised and meet fire and safety standards.</P>
      <P>The results in leaving certificate honours mathematics examinations are unsatisfactory.  A more positive approach is needed towards the teaching of mathematics and science subjects in the leaving certificate.  We are speaking about the Celtic tiger, the progress of our economy and jobs.  We should examine what we are talking about.  To a considerable extent the booming economy has been heavily dependent on Structural Funds and on how our taxes are organised.  Structural Funding is easing off.  The German Finance Minister, and a number of our European partners, are looking to Ireland and considering the possibility of introducing changes.  If and when Ireland has tax harmonisation we may suddenly realise we have a problem on our hands.</P>
      <P>I felt a shiver down my spine when I heard what was happening at Fruit of the Loom.  The company is not unique.  Companies come here, get what they can as fast as they can, make whatever profits are possible, and depart.  That is particularly true in the clothing sector.</P>
      <P>In the computer and software industry we have very highly skilled workers.  However, much of what they do is dependent on tax breaks and so on.  It is important to be aware of this.  Therefore, we need to expand our horizons.  We have failed to make inroads into the food and many other sectors.  Money should be invested in science and research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of a Bill that will help copperfasten the State's success in the field of high technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed amendment to the Science and Technological Education (Investment) Fund, will ensure our educational institutions have the resources to deepen their role in research and development.  Their work has helped Ireland to build an international profile as a centre of excellence <Col N="817" /> in high technology.  They have shown us the development of our intellectual resources is vital to the preservation of our economic strength.</P>
    <P>In the past, the State did not have the where-withal to support research and development to the extent it merited.  That we have managed to achieve so much, without those resources, is a tribute to the ability, the determination and the vision of all working in these sectors.  However, even vision and determination have their limits. Eventually the availability of funding becomes a vital factor if development is to be sustained.  We have reached that point and for that reason I am pleased to speak in support of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that research and development have assumed an importance of ever increasing magnitude in the modern era.  Through it, the technological revolution has been responsible for transforming and improving the lives of millions of people in Ireland and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Technology has transformed the State and the economic benefits it has brought mean that today, on the cusp of the 21st century, Ireland has one of the strongest economies in the world.  The opportunities created by that economic strength are beginning to open up to all sectors of society. Unemployment, once a seemingly intractable problem, is finally beginning to diminish.  For the first time ever people are coming to Ireland to find work.  Our emigrants are returning.  Our young people are able to stay at home without sacrificing the hope of a prosperous future.  This is as a result of our unprecedented economic growth; growth which is based on technology, research and development.</P>
    <P>It is essential for future prosperity to support all those working to develop our technological expertise.  These are the people who will keep us ahead of our competitors and ensure Ireland's international reputation and success are maintained. Initiatives such as this Bill will ensure our future graduates and post-graduates can continue to meet high international standards.</P>
    <P>We are at a critical point in our efforts to ensure our research and development base is wide enough to allow for the continuing development of the national economy.  We have already moved to address this demand, through the setting up of the £250 million Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund, after returning to office last year.  This has provided the necessary funding to modernise our third-level institutions and meet emerging skills needs.  This amendment to that fund will build on the success it has already achieved and ensure that researchers working in the third level sector are supported with the most up to date resources available.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to the Bill facilitates the immediate payment into the fund of a further £30 million for capital purposes, bringing the Government's commitment to the fund to £280 million.  The £30 million additional capital will be supported by a three year programme of current <Col N="818" /> funding of which £7.5 million will be provided by the private sector.</P>
    <P>The key to the development of funding for research and development, has been the united approach of the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in both of which I have the privilege of serving. They have worked closely to ensure a clear and focused approach to funding in this area.  That co-ordination will continue to ensure we are well served by the efficient and judicious allocation of finance.  The Higher Education Authority will continue to play an important role in the assignment of funds to individual and group projects. The peer review system for individual basic research projects will continue to be operated by the National Research Support Fund Board, under the aegis of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>Europe has a vision &mdash; a vision of what the future will be &mdash; a Europe of the 21st century with a thriving industrial sector, a healthy environment and a greater well-being for all EU citizens. This vision is encapsulated in the proposal for an EU fifth research framework programme. Next week, research ministers of the EU will make final decisions on this programme which will make available almost £12 billion to researchers in the next four years.</P>
    <P>The aim of the programme is to harness the power of science and technology and the resources and knowledge that reside within the EU to create the Europe of tomorrow.  We are part of that vision.  Irish researchers have had considerable success in past framework programmes. The return to Ireland under the fourth framework programme has been in the region of £140 million.</P>
    <P>The Scientific and Technological Education Fund will enhance the potential for Irish researchers to participate in the fifth framework programme through an enhanced research capability within the third level sector.  The third level sector is central to the national system of innovation. Equally, industry is central.  Industry, through collaboration with academic researchers will benefit from the enhanced third level infrastructure provided by these funds.  This combination will maximise the impact of the investment the Government is making and will help to ensure that knowledge creation adds to the economic and social prosperity of Ireland.</P>

    <P>The Government has made clear its intention to promote research and development in the State to a level commensurate with our economic ambitions.  During the past 18 months we have succeeded in raising the profile of this important area to a level never before achieved in the history of the State.  The Bill will raise that profile <Col N="819" /> even further, ensuring that the momentum we have built up in recent years is maintained and increased.  By investing in research and development we are investing in the foundations of future prosperity and for that reason I commend the Bill to the House for its ratification.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The circumstances surrounding this Bill are well known to all Members.  They were brought to light in the October 1998 issue of <i>Magill</i> magazine which made certain allegations regarding the collection of deposit interest retention tax.  That article and other revelations in the media raised questions about the actions of a major financial institution and, by implication, other banks here. The allegations raised the issue of the efficiency and effectiveness of the systems operated by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The public quite rightly demanded action.  A rapid response came, I am proud to say, from Members.  The Committee of Public Accounts focused its examination of the Appropriation Accounts of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the core issues exposed in the media.  The proceedings of the committee brought to the surface, in the first instance, a fundamental conflict about the administration of deposit interest retention tax between the Revenue Commissioners and AIB.</P>
      <P>Having been made aware of the key issues, the House passed a resolution on 21 October which asked that the Committee of Public Accounts examine and report to Dáil Éireann, <i>inter alia</i>, on &ldquo;any purported settlement between the financial institutions and the Revenue Commissioners in respect of undeclared DIRT&rdquo; and information known to the financial institutions and regulatory authorities concerning the use of bogus non-resident accounts.  By means of that resolution Dáil Éireann also pledged to facilitate the committee in its investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered the matter, the committee realised that its existing powers would not be sufficient to further its investigations into this matter. Accordingly, it made a series of recommendations about how best to proceed.  The key point <Col N="820" /> was that the Comptroller and Auditor General should be requested by Dáil Éireann to prepare a report and be empowered to conduct a thorough investigation.  On receipt of his report, the Committee of Public Accounts would then continue its examination of the key issues, using enhanced powers under the compellability Act, and make recommendations on further action.  These are, in essence, the arrangements made by the Bill. Before discussing its provisions, I want to emphasise two important features of these legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>First, the arrangements of the Bill have been tailored to a specific situation, namely, to carry out one inquiry into how the Revenue Commissioners and financial institutions &mdash; and perhaps others &mdash; comported themselves in the matter of collecting DIRT.  We are not putting in place elaborate or bureaucratic procedures; these arrangements will, in effect, cease when that inquiry is completed.  Second, the basic proposal originated with a cross-party group of Members at the Committee of Public Accounts &mdash; this is a common effort crossing conventional boundaries.</P>
    <P>In the past there was, perhaps, a belief among some Members that entrusting to themselves the kind of investigations which had traditionally been undertaken by tribunals would lead to inquiries being conducted more speedily, more effectively and with a greater awareness of public concern.  Deputy Quinn, when he occupied my post, went some way towards this by bring forward the compellability Act in 1997.  In doing so, he had to disabuse many of our colleagues of the idea that procedures, generous time limits for responding to directions and safeguards on individual rights, could be modified.</P>
    <P>The issue we are faced with is one of great complexity.  Members realised that investigating it fully would take more time than parliamentarians could give without neglecting their wider legislative duties and the care of their constituents.  What they decided upon was a two tier arrangement in which the Comptroller and Auditor General would present the relevant facts and identify areas of dispute.  The committee would then draw on his report to reach conclusions, determine findings and make recommendations.  This division of labour is the lynch-pin of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As already stated, the Bill is based on the recommendations contained in the First Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts. The fact that this is not a party political matter strengthens the basis for the investigation.  On both sides of the House we agree there are serious matters to be investigated; we agree on the essential arrangements for the investigation; we agree that the Dáil should request the Comptroller and Auditor General to prepare a report; we agree that to carry out his investigation he must have new powers to compel the giving of evidence and confer privilege; we agree that the Committee of Public Accounts should examine his report and, if necessary, hear further evidence; we agree that the committee should have <Col N="821" /> enhanced powers under the compellability Act in furthering its inquiry; and we agree that the committee must draw conclusions, reach findings and make recommendations on further action.</P>
    <P>The matters on which we agree constitute the core of the investigation.  They are all provided for in this Bill.  Moreover, focusing the statutory basis for the inquiry on the administration of DIRT will allow the investigation to concentrate squarely on the central issues.  Was there an agreement between the Revenue Commissioners and a financial institution, in particular AIB, in respect of undeducted deposit interest retention tax during the early 1990s?  If so, what was the basis and nature of that arrangement?  Were the systems, practices and procedures of the Revenue Commissioners adequate in relation to the administration of the deposit interest retention tax?  Were those systems properly implemented during the relevant period?  Did the financial institutions exercise their statutory duty of care in satisfying themselves that relevant accounts were genuinely non-resident?  Were the financial institutions aware of the existence and extent of bogus non-resident accounts?  If they knew, what did they do about these bogus accounts?  If not, why not?</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter, I have been concerned that a good idea which came from the Committee of Public Accounts should not run into difficulties from a legal or constitutional viewpoint.  This has not been an easy task.  A considerable amount of time was spent with the Office of the Attorney General and the legal advisers of the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that we had solutions on issues which could put the Comptroller and Auditor General or the committee on the hazard.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has a clear-cut function under the Constitution and in moving him somewhat away from that base &mdash; as we have done in the Bill &mdash; we had to copper-fasten an area where he might have been challenged for moving into policing the private sector.  The arrangement that he can get access to private information in financial institutions only through an independent auditor has been devised as a defence.</P>
    <P>In co-operating with the Comptroller and Auditor General in this investigation, I want to assure those who have evidence to give that they are not at risk of criminal prosecution on foot of what they say or give in evidence.  At the same time, should the Comptroller and Auditor General come across <i>prima facie</i> evidence of non-payment or underpayment of tax, he can draw that information to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.  However, he cannot publish names or any other means of identifying individual account holders in his report to the Dáil.  This investigation should concentrate on the core issues I have outlined.  That is what is needed and what the members of the Committee of Public Accounts requested.  I am certain that the <Col N="822" /> Comptroller and Auditor General will not be deflected from these core issues.</P>
    <P>The House can be satisfied that all those concerned with the preparation of this Bill have moved quickly to respond to the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts. Barely 55 days have elapsed since Dáil Éireann passed the resolution seeking powers to continue the inquiry into this matter.  The legislative package we have drafted is necessarily complex in its construction but it is simple and straightforward in its objective: to get at the truth, fairly and quickly.</P>
    <P>By convention my Second Stage speech should address substantive provisions of the Bill but I am constrained more than usual by time.  I propose, therefore, to give a brief summary of some of the specific provisions.</P>
    <P>With the exception of a limited number of matters, the special provisions of the Bill are temporary. This is provided for in section 1 by attaching the special provisions to the Committee of Public Accounts as defined for the purposes of the investigation. When the committee completes its report to Dáil Éireann the special provisions lapse unless the precise terms provided for are replicated.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the core of the Bill.  It provides for the examinations and investigations which the Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out, defines the relevant areas of tax law, the Revenue procedures to be investigated and specifies the purposes of the investigation.  It provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General may appoint independent auditors to examine the accounts of private individuals held by financial institutions, if necessary.  The section makes provision for the preparation of interim reports where self-contained elements of the investigation have been completed and finalised.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the presentation of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann are analogous to the arrangements for the reports of tribunals.  They permit the Comptroller and Auditor General, at his discretion, to make a copy available to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The chairman of the committee is most anxious to be supplied as early as possible with a copy of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</P>
    <P>Provisions empowering the Comptroller and Auditor General to gather evidence are modelled variously on the compellability Act and, where appropriate, are analogous to the powers of an inspector appointed under the Companies Act. They are set out in sections 3 to 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Using these powers the Comptroller and Auditor General may request witnesses to present evidence or give documents in the knowledge that the privileges and immunities of a High Court witness will apply to them.  If a witness refuses to co-operate, the Comptroller and Auditor General has powers to compel them to give evidence, administering an oath, if necessary.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that investigations and inquiries <Col N="823" /> do not come free.  The Bill has specific provisions for the payment of reasonable expenses from public money of certain persons giving evidence. By way of balance, however, section 18 allows the Minister for Finance to seek recovery of costs from a financial institution in the courts.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to section 11.  This is a permanent provision which provides for absolute privilege for the chairman and members of the committee for the purpose of the performance of their functions.  Such protection was specifically requested in the interim report of the committee. This privilege does not cover interviews or comments made by them on television or radio or in the print media.  Section 12 is also a permanent provision which gives absolute privilege for the performance of functions by the Comptroller and Auditor General and his officers.</P>
    <P>Section 13 removes restrictions on the disclosure of information imposed by law or contracts. For example, this section will lift obligations of confidentiality on former employees of companies for the purposes of this investigation.  This removal of confidentiality will not apply to obligations imposed by EU directives and double taxation agreements with other states.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General is exempted from confidentiality provisions in EU directives, this remains subject to any conditions set, for example, professional secrecy.</P>
    <P>The House will note that section 14 allows the Comptroller and Auditor General seek directions from the High Court to obtain clarification as to how he should exercise his powers and to resolve quickly potential constitutional conflict.  In carrying out its examination the committee will be able to appoint experts to give advice, guidance or other assistance during its proceedings and its discussions at private meetings may not be disclosed without the consent of the chairman.  There are other permanent amendments to the compellability Act to clarify the granting of a block consent to the use of compellability powers for a full investigation.  Crucially, section 20 temporarily removes the restriction on investigations in relation to tax liability contained in the compellability Act.</P>
    <P>The House will read this Bill as a controlled and measured response to the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the arrangements made, the rights of Members to seek the truth are carefully balanced with the natural and constitutional rights of citizens to fair procedure and due process.  I can understand the enthusiasm of some Members to go even further. The responsibility to deliver a workable mechanism rests with the Government.  We have done this well in the short time available and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy Jim Mitchell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity this legislation is being rushed.  It is unfair to the Minister that he has only 15 minutes <Col N="824" /> in which to present his case and to the Opposition that all Stages have to be taken today.  I understand the Government is anxious that the legislation is passed before the House goes into recess so that work can commence from 1 January but the Bill could have been presented last week.  We only received today the draft of the resolution which I understand is to be taken without debate on Thursday.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the background to events.  It was reported in <i>Magill</i> that bogus non-resident accounts were used to evade the payment of DIRT.  There were allegations that a settlement was reached between AIB and the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the amounts of DIRT due.  It transpired in evidence at the Committee of Public Accounts that AIB saw this as a forward looking arrangement.  There was a difference of interpretation of what happened in the discussions between the Revenue Commissioners and AIB.  There were further allegations that the practice was widespread in the banking industry.  There appeared to be a <i>prima facie</i> case that the payment of DIRT on non-resident accounts between 1986 and 1991 was honoured more in the breach than in the observance and that there might be an outstanding tax liability which should be made good if that is the finding of the committee.</P>
    <P>I compliment the committee and its chairman on its excellent work.  It brought the case as far as it could under its existing powers.  We are seeking to ensure its powers, and those of the Comptroller and Auditor General, are adequate to carry the investigation further.</P>
    <P>The mechanism proposed appears cumbersome. The purpose is to grant extra powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It appears, however, that they will allow him to deal with this event alone.  If that is the case, I cannot understand why the legal advisers believed it was necessary to proceed by way of resolution and this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the core of the Bill.  It allows Dáil Éireann to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate where it has been apprised of <i>prima facie</i> evidence of substantial risk to the revenues of the State.  It appears, therefore, that this is an enabling Bill to allow Dáil Éireann to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate where there is a loss of revenue to the Exchequer but the section goes on to state that the Comptroller and Auditor General is being empowered to investigate the position in relation to DIRT only.  The resolution deals with this matter in greater detail.</P>
    <P>If the purpose of the Bill is to deal with the allegations made in <i>Magill</i> with which we are all familiar, why is it necessary to adopt this cumbersome approach of activating the Bill by way of resolution?  Why was the resolution not put into the text of section 2.  If, on the other hand, the Bill was intended as legislation which would permanently enhance the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General and under which he would be invited to carry out investigations on behalf of <Col N="825" /> the Dáil when the Exchequer was in serious loss, I would support the way things are being done.  It looks as if a policy decision was taken to give extra powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General which would be invoked by way of Dáil Resolution but at some stage there were second thoughts about the advisability of that course.  It looks as if the Resolution process was then proceeded with but the terms of the Bill confined to this event alone.  The Bill dies as soon as this investigation is completed.  I do not understand the cumbersome manner in which it was approached.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also allows the Comptroller and Auditor General to employ an auditor to carry out research for him.  I would have thought the staff of the Comptroller's office were skilled at auditing.  That is their bread and butter.  They examine Government Departments, assess whether money voted by the Houses of the Oireachtas has been spent appropriately and report back.  Their skills are those of auditors and accountants.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the legal nicety referred to by the Minister when he said that if the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out such examinations himself that would constitute an extension of his powers beyond his traditional role but if he appointed an auditor to do work on his behalf it would not.  It must be a principle of law that an agent carrying out the functions of a principal acts at all times on behalf of the principal and whatever legal risks exist would be incurred by the agent as much as by the principal if he did the work directly.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister address the following two questions in his reply?  Why is the approach under section 2 so cumbersome and why is this once-off legislation, when it is couched in the terms of a special provisions Bill whereby the Dáil can invoke these powers in circumstances other than those we refer to this evening?  Can the Minister give the House a more lengthy explanation of why it is deemed necessary that an auditor exercise skills which the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff quite clearly have?  It is difficult to understand the way this measure is constructed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 11 and spoke of the privilege of members of committees.  I am glad the Minister has taken this opportunity to ensure that the work carried out by members of committees is privileged and that utterances by members of committees for the purpose of the performance of their functions is absolutely privileged. I understand the chairperson of one of our committees is being sued in a private capacity.  As yet, the Government has not decided if they will indemnify him.  It is important that such utterances be privileged.</P>
    <P>The Minister was ambiguous in his speech.  He said this will be a permanent provision and will provide absolute privilege for the chairmen and members of committees for the purpose of the performance of their functions.  However, this <Col N="826" /> privilege does not cover interviews or comments made by them on TV, radio or in the print media. What then does it cover?  Discussions with professional advisers, perhaps?  If privilege does not cover interviews or statements made or carried on TV, radio or in the print media then what privilege is being given?  Does it simply cover the writing of official letters by the chairman of a committee or discussions with a legal adviser or accountant?  I am sure members of committees are hoping that privilege will cover interviews or comments made by them when carrying out their functions if they place a comment in the print media or on radio or television.  I would like the Minister to return to this matter.  He did not have sufficent time to explain it.  The time is inadequate and I would like my colleague, the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Noonan for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister, his Department, the Government and Members on all sides of the House for their support of almost everything in the first interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This was followed by a Private Members' motion in the name of the Labour Party which was passed on 21 October.</P>
      <P>This is a complex issue and the Committee of Public Accounts has no doubt that it is breaking new ground for parliamentary committees.  My colleagues have acted with full commitment and discretion.  We are conscious of the need to continue to do so throughout this process.  The Bill, in general, deals with the issues raised by the committee but I wish to raise one or two problems.</P>
      <P>First, contrary to what the Minister said in his speech, there is no provision for an early report to be given to the chairman or clerk of the committee. A High Court inspector, an authorised officer of a Minister or a tribunal of inquiry all would furnish a report in advance to those seeking it to allow for proper planning of the next step before the matter becomes public.  I regret that this has not been provided for in the Bill and I hope it will be provided for in the Resolutions.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill does not provide for the committee to have the same rights as the Comptroller and Auditor General to go to the courts for direction in advance where that is deemed necessary. This might be a necessary power in order to avoid avoidable delay.  The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunity of Witnesses) Act, 1997, contains several provisions allowing for 21 and 31 days notice. The public are anxious that accountability be applied as speedily as possible.  Speed cannot compromise natural justice but a provision allowing for a shorter time span while allowing a committee the discretion to allow a longer time where feasible, would expedite the completion of inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A third area of concern has been brought to <Col N="827" /> my attention today and delayed my coming to the house.  One interpretation of section 2(1)<i>(c)</i> is that it imposes a very acute limitation on the Comptroller and Auditor General, much more acute than I was given to understand.  The argument for the employment of a private auditor was that the auditor would do the job of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to private bank accounts to as to ensure the privacy of those bank accounts.  This is something with which the committee completely concurs.  It appears, however, that this power will prevent the Comptroller and Auditor General getting any documents, including internal audit reports, bank minutes, correspondence and so on from a bank for fear they might mention an individual account holder in passing.</P>
    <P>I would like an amendment to be tabled later this evening to put it beyond doubt that nothing in that subsection prohibits the Comptroller and Auditor General from accessing general documents of banks, even if they refer to an individual bank account holder.  I am sure it is not beyond the wisdom of the parliamentary draftsman to provide that where such references are made they could be substituted by references X, Y or Z in copies provided to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  If the Comptroller and Auditor General is to be effectively stopped from directly seeing copies of bank account holders' statements, that could scupper the inquiry and might compromise the committee's effectiveness thereafter.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I decided to introduce this amending legislation when I became aware of difficulties people were experiencing, of which many other Members may also be aware.  A person, whose husband has left the family home and did not make a contribution towards mortgage repayments, told me that she had been making mortgage repayments to a building society for almost eight years.  She applied for her shares when the building society <Col N="828" /> went public but was told she was not entitled to any shares.  She thought that was absurd, as did I. When I asked questions of people who should know the answers, I learned that the building society was perfectly in order in giving the shares to that woman's husband simply because he was the official recognised joint holder of the joint mortgage account.  He was recognised as the person to whom the society wrote.</P>
      <P>We will recall that Humpty Dumpty said, in a scornful tone, that &ldquo;When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.&rdquo;  When the Building Societies Act was passed in 1989 somebody decided that a joint account was not what most people would consider it to be, but what the Minister of the day thought it was, which was not a joint account. When I heard on a radio programme last night that a judge was quoted as saying that all citizens in this State are equal before the law, I thought back to what happened in 1989 when the two holders of a joint account were not treated as equals. One was treated as the important person, was sent all the literature and given all the rights associated with the account, while the other account holder was treated as a non-person.  In nine out of ten cases, the account holder who was treated as a non-person was a woman because invariably the man signed the documents and the woman was tolerated and eventually allowed to sign documents.</P>
      <P>It is incredible it is only nine years since the Building Societies Act came into force.  The Family Home Protection Bill and equal rights legislation were introduced and matters seemed to have advanced a good deal by 1989, yet this Bill was introduced, which blew out of the water concepts of justice and equality.  I do not understand why certain provisions were included in that legislation. It may have suited the building societies, but why did they get their way?  They must have asked for something.  I discovered today that this Bill went through both Houses at election time and it was proposed that it and the Central Bank Bill be put through the Seanad on the same day. However, the then Opposition did not tolerate that and Senators Manning and O'Toole led the Opposition out of the Seanad, but those two Bills were passed on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lesson to be learned in that.  It may be as well to allow legislation go through the Seanad in the normal way rather than treating the Seanad as a rubber stamp exercise.  There are sharp brains in the Seanad and I find it incredible that they would tolerate some of the provisions in this Bill in 1989.  That rushing of that Bill through the Seanad might explain some of the reasons this Bill became an Act of parliament under which the building societies operate and deliver a service.  A provision which required the building societies to send out a notice to only one holder of a joint account may have suited the building societies, but it did not suit the women of Ireland.  That may not be an issue if a couple are living in harmony and perfectly happy when <Col N="829" /> one letter may suffice.  However, we live in an era when there has been an increase in marital breakdown and communications between some partners are not what they should be, and in those circumstances one letter can be damning.</P>
    <P>Section 16(6) of the Act states that where two or more persons jointly hold shares in a society the following provision shall apply: (a) the person whose name first appears on the records of the society in relation to shares jointly held shall be the representative joint holder.  That provision takes beating.  The person whose name appears second on the records is treated as a non-person. I suppose they are only there for the beer.  A standard is not set in regard to that provision.  It is not the person with pink eyes and green ears, blue eyes and black ears, the person with the most money or the person who is six foot tall or five foot tall who shall be the representative joint holder, but the person whose name first appears on the records of the society.</P>
    <P>At that time usually men were the first to sign a document and invariably women were the second to sign it.  One can imagine a person, who was well reared and mannerly, when called to sign that document in a building society, stepping back and saying &ldquo;darling, you sign it&rdquo; not realising that he or she was signing away his or her rights to shares in the future.  The more I read this Act the more I find it incredible that it was passed by this House, but it was rushed through the Seanad.  It would not be passed now because it does not respect the legal or constitutional rights of individuals.</P>
    <P>When an Opposition Member introduces a Bill, invariably the Government points out the constitutional grounds on which it can be challenged and if it infringes an individual's legal rights. Given that some Government Deputies must have been aware from representations by some of their constituents that this Act infringed the legal rights of account holders, it is amazing that in the nine years since this Act was passed none of them raised the issue of account holders' constitutional rights.  I gather at this stage that the Government is concerned about the constitutional rights of account holders about whom they were not concerned before.  If this Bill had been challenged on constitutional grounds in the Supreme Court, the case would not continue for more than a half hour under a sensible judge because the Act disregards the concept of legal rights.  How could it be decided that the rights of one party to a joint account do not count?  If that is the mentality of legislators, we need to change the system, the legislators or advisers because that provision does not make sense and other provisions follow on from that.</P>
    <P>Section 16(b) of that Act states that except where the rules of the society otherwise provide, any notice or other document required by this Act to be sent by a society to the holders of shares in the society, shall be deemed to have been sent to the joint holders if it is sent to the representative joint holder.  They have decided <Col N="830" /> that they will cover themselves simply by sending the documentation to one account holder.  That may be fine when everything is going well in the relationship.  Suppose they recognised representative joint holders and one of these &mdash; I presume it is the man &mdash; is a gambler, drinker or womaniser who wastes money which should be spent in the home.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: The other person thinks their mortgage is being paid, although the defaulter may have got several letters stating that if he does not catch up on his repayments, the house will be confiscated.  The other person does not know anything about this because the correspondence is not passed on to them.  The second person's name may be on the letter but that does not mean they will see it.  It depends on the type of relationship.</P>
      <P>The fact that building societies can send out one notice to joint holders is another form of madness.  The situation was daft in 1989 and it is still daft.  I hope we will not hear any nonsense from the Government side about the constitutional and legal rights of individuals.  There are no rights in the 1989 Act as far as individuals are concerned.  One out of every two is treated with contempt and told they are a nobody.  It reminds me of boarding school where we used to grab as many potatoes as we could from the big bowl in the middle of the table before the dean told us to put them back and have manners.  The first one to rush to the table gets the goodies and they are set up for life.  They pay nothing on the mortgage, but when the company goes public they will get their shares.  If that is treating people equally, then I am a Dutch man.</P>
      <P>Section 2(c) deals with the right to vote.  There may be worries about two people voting at an annual general meeting.  It would make more sense to allow two people who are joint shareholders to vote than giving one person the right to vote for two.  Perhaps that would make sense if one partner had legal or business expertise, but it is stupid to give that right to a person because they were the first to sign a document.  The Minister will probably talk about the rights of shareholders and building societies, but we should deal with this glaring injustice.</P>
      <P>Why were we not concerned with what happened over the past nine years?  Nobody accepts it was right.  I have explained to Government advisers and the Independents that this is a simple Bill which should be accepted.  Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>(6) Where two or more persons jointly hold shares in a society, the following provisions shall apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) the persons whose names appear in the records of the society in relation to shares jointly held, shall share equally those shares <Col N="831" /> except in relation to the ownership of such shares where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) a legal agreement concluded by such persons prescribes differently, or</P>
    <P>(ii) where court orders are in being specifying a different ownership.</P>
    <P>We should treat joint ownership as joint ownership and ensure that shares are shared equally, except in the case of a marriage breakdown where there may be a legal agreement or court order.  I do not understand how anyone could oppose that today, let alone 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also states that &ldquo;except where an agreement or a court order such as those specified in paragraph (a) exist, and the provisions thereunder have been properly furnished to a society, any notice or other document required by this Act to be sent to the holders of shares in the society should be sent to each of the joint holders&rdquo;.  Why can that not be supported by all Members?  Building societies should notify joint holders, not one holder.  If relationships are not good, one person could be given the information and keep it from their partner so that they do not know the roof is disappearing over their head. The building societies will not go bankrupt if they have to notify joint holders.  If they lose money, they will find a simple way to rectify it, such as increasing their rates.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also states:</P>
    <P>where under this Act a member of a society may vote at a meeting or under a postal ballot by virtue of being a holder of shares in the society and such person is a joint holder of such shares, the person entitled to exercise the rights conferred by sections 68, 69 and 72 to 74 shall, notwithstanding anything in those sections, and unless otherwise specified in an agreement such as that specified in paragraph (a), be each of the joint holders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One may need a bigger venue if everyone attends an annual general meeting.  At present, the number of people interested in annual general meetings is limited.  Even if one hired out Croke Park and Lansdowne Road and linked them together by telephone, it would not justify not giving each person their rights.  There was no difficulty ignoring the right of the second partner to vote at an annual general meeting when the legislation was enacted.</P>
    <P>What does a joint account mean if both people do not have equal rights?  We could split hairs on this subject and say there are too many people attending annual general meetings.  Why accept joint accounts if two or more people cannot vote? Why not call them superior and inferior accounts?  If joint account holders are not treated equally, they should not be called joint accounts. It is incomprehensible that this Act was passed.  It was not discussed in the Seanad as the Opposition walked out.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill is accepted because it rectifies <Col N="832" /> a wrong which has existed since 1989.  People knew only the first signatory would receive shares, but nobody seemed to be concerned about it.  I introduced this Bill because I met someone who was wronged by the 1989 Act.  I have no problem if the Government wants to amend it, but I hope it accepts it in the spirit in which I introduced it.  I know it will give justice to those who have been wronged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Browne on introducing this Bill to amend unfair and unjust legislation.  The Bill is simple and is based on equal rights.  I know Deputy Browne wonders how this came about.  It seems extraordinary that this hangover is still contained in the Building Societies Act, 1989.  I believe it is part and parcel of the long struggle of legislators and house and non-house owners, particularly women, outside this House.</P>
      <P>I am old enough to remember the introduction of the Family Home Protection Bill, 1976.  I remember the difficulties, the debates and allegations made then about property owners, financial institutions, unconstitutional matters and the right to private property.  In the meantime women found to their huge cost that a valuer or an estate agent could land on their doorsteps to tell them their houses were up for sale because they were in their husbands' names.  Many other Members will be aware of this.  Young people today, particularly women, find it difficult to believe that was the case in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>That legislation is one of the most important milestones in our recent history.  For the first time the right of the mother, wife and home maker in the family home was in some way safeguarded. Because of traditional and invidious discrimination against her in the 1937 Constitution, until then she was denied the right to work outside the home or to be a joint owner or contributor to the mortgage.  The male was the breadwinner, the house owner, the writer and owner of deeds and the property owner.  What we are finding here is a continuation and extension of the mindset which took so long to change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many sound financial reasons for the huge discrimination that only the husband and breadwinner was responsible for paying the mortgage.  However, the work practices and financial independence of women have changed so much that, apart from the principle of equality, it throws up all kinds of unfair and unjust circumstances, such as that raised by Deputy Browne where many women struggle when husbands leave or run the house into debt.  Many of these women go out to work and contribute to the mortgage, but then find they are not legally recognised as jointly involved even when, as Deputy Browne stated, they are named jointly on the mortgage.  We will all be aware of the difficulty of trying to get mortgages transferred into joint ownership but where there is a joint legal entitlement from the beginning, this is incredible and makes no sense. <Col N="833" /> It is a continuation of the other shocking situation which prevailed after the Family Home Protection Act, 1976, came into force, which extended some kind of protection to women, and even after the family home could not be sold without the written consent of the wife.  There were many cases in the bad days of recession where, for the sake of her husband or a business which was collapsing, a wife signed over her rights and the banks won court cases because they held a stronger constitutional right to the family home than the wife.  This, again, leads us to wonder about the rights of private property in our hallowed Constitution which sanctifies the role of woman as home maker, mother and wife.</P>
    <P>Until the introduction of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act, 1989, the only protection and acknowledgement a woman had with regard to the family home was that it could not be sold without her written consent.  If it was sold, the contents &mdash; the furniture, the kitchen equipment and the curtains, which she may even have made &mdash; were deemed legally to be those of her husband unless she was earning outside the home and could produce receipts which showed she had paid for them.</P>
    <P>When one considers the attitudes and the legislation which laid down that type of second-class citizenship and lack of property rights for women in the home, what we are debating now is an extension of it.  Like Deputy Browne and others, I feel this is depressing at a time when we are entering a new millennium.  I acknowledge the commitment on all sides to equality of status for women and other groups.  That is why I appeal to the Government to take on board the extraordinary injustice and the traditional devaluing discrimination which is encased in this, to allow the amendment to be made to the legislation and to put our money where our mouths are with regard to equality.  We should ensure legislation which emerges from this House fulfils the principles of equality.  People should not have to find out the hard way or to struggle.  The institutions should not be able to state, as they did to Deputy Browne and others who made inquiries, that the legislators and not the institutions are to blame. Recent history shows that, when it comes to initiatives with regard to fair play or equality, banks or building societies are not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Not only is this our responsibility because the legislation emanated from these Houses, but evidently it is also necessary because the financial institutions will not take on board the fair argument made by Deputy Browne when he brought this case to the management concerned.  Perhaps it was just as well he did not succeed in that case because we have stumbled on the fact that this is happening in a society where greater numbers of women carry at least half the partnership and half the burden of mortgage repayments.  Therefore, they should have at least a joint interest in the shares also.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Browne pointed out, in many cases even where the relations are not bad but where <Col N="834" /> there may be a sense of secrecy or financial privacy about the first named person, usually the husband, he may not see it as his wife's business and that there is nothing to be told.  Not only must we provide for equality on fair and just financial grounds, but we must endorse it, particularly due to the long history of lack of property rights for women.</P>
    <P>The Government should welcome the introduction of this legislation by Deputy Browne.  As legislators with commitments to not only Irish equal status legislation but also international agreements, because this could be taken up at other levels, there should be cross-party acceptance that even if it is late it is something we must do urgently.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that this and previous Governments have repeatedly made public commitments to true equality.  We set up a Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Even half a Department should be able to get across the discrepancy and discrimination involved.  If the Government does not accept this Bill and amend the legislation urgently, it will reflect badly on its sincerity.  The Government cannot have it both ways.  It denied child care resources in the budget because of the concern about women in the home versus women outside the home.  This has not been done with regard to men.  However, if the Government really cares about homemaking and protecting the role of women in the home, and would curtail and delay child care resources because of the complexity of this issue, the least it can do to make up for that huge deficit is to accept this amendment without demur.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Browne on introducing this Bill which, I hope, the Government will accept.  If it has difficulty with any sections or wishes to introduce amendments, Opposition parties will be to the fore in trying to achieve the best possible legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill attempts to ensure that equal rights are given to joint mortgage holders.  It seems unusual to have to introduce a Bill to ensure that. The husband and wife should be regularly notified about the state of the mortgage account.  All Members, including the Minister of State &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is a member of the women's rights committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will have come across cases in which the husband squandered money, as a result of which the payments fell into arrears.  If the husband and wife had been notified of the state of the account, the wife would have been aware that payments were not being made and would have ensured the matter was dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> This happens quite regularly and it is important to tackle this problem forthwith.</P>
    <P>Another problem has arisen with regard to issuing shares.  It is manifestly wrong that shares are only given to one named person.  Shares should be issued in the joint names of the husband and wife.  Problems arose in a number of cases in which the husband had left the family home and the wife had been making payments. When a share windfall occurs the wife finds that, having made all the payments, she does not get any shares.  They go to her husband.  No system can tolerate such inequity and injustice.</P>
    <P>I would like to extend the remit of this Bill.  I call for the appointment of a totally independent ombudsman to ensure fair play for families who take out loans from building societies.  There is an ombudsman for credit institutions financed by building societies.  A similar situation existed with regard to an insurance ombudsman financed by insurance companies.  It is hard to be totally independent when one's salaries are being paid by institutions with which one is dealing regularly.  It is essential to appoint a totally independent ombudsman.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Irish Times</i> of November 13 carried an article by Colm Keenan relating to a case in which the Irish Permanent tried to evict a couple it had overcharged.  It admitted in court that it had overcharged them for two years and blamed a systems failure due to human error.  This couple, Mr. and Mrs. Eustace, were threatened with eviction because the building society had made serious errors in overcharging.  As it turned out, this was not an isolated case.  There were many other such cases.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this issue.  The details of the overcharging emerged during the case and I am glad that situation was remedied.  However, it was only remedied after this couple had put everything they had at risk by going to court and taking on a large building society with a panoply of the best legal and financial advice available to it.</P>
    <P>I compliment Mr. Justice Groarke on his judgment.  He stated that the company had grossly miscalculated interest charges on sums due and that demands were made and proceedings instituted for sums of money which were in doubt.  If the couple had lost they would have been evicted.  That should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Another sad case involved Eileen Malone whose husband died.  The Irish Nationwide attempted to evict Mrs. Malone and her four children. This was a sad situation involving a nine-year battle in which this woman must have gone through much trauma, worry and upset.  One can only imagine what it must be like to be evicted and put on the side of the road in 1998.  This woman's husband died suddenly before a mortgage protection policy was taken out.  The Irish Nationwide took this family to court to try to <Col N="836" /> obtain possession of the premises &mdash; a public house.</P>
    <P>In his judgment, Mr. Justice Lynch stated that the society was manifestly negligent with regard to the handling of the Malones' insurance application. How can this happen?  Counsel for the Malones argued that they had not been free to look for their own insurance cover.  They should have been entitled to look for their own insurance cover.  This woman was trying to carry on a business in a supermarket-licensed premises and she was almost evicted.</P>
    <P>I have corresponded with Mr. Gerry Murphy, the ombudsman for the credit institutions.  I received an exceptionally courteous reply. However, with the greatest respect to Mr. Murphy, my efforts were a waste of time and I was disappointed with the attitude and the reply on behalf of a constituent.  This constituent was in dispute with the Irish Nationwide and the society had to be paid in full.  However, the file on this case includes references to costs such as: interest charged; legal charges, adjustment charges; further advances and so on.</P>
    <P>Anyone can suffer ill health and fall into arrears.  However, at such a time, instead of being helpful, building societies come down on people and pursue them with vigour.  If people are not able to make their repayments, building societies will attempt to evict them.  This is 1998, not 1898 or 1798 and what is happening is wrong.  I appeal to the Minister of State to appoint an ombudsman to ensure fair play for the ordinary borrower trying to build a family home.  Such people need protection. It is not a case of equals.  Building societies are very strong, unlike ordinary families. People do not have the ability to stand up to these organisations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne is to be commended for putting this matter back on the political agenda.  In responding to this Bill on behalf of the Government, I would first like to make clear to the House that I and the Government have sympathy with the broad objective underlying the Bill, which I understand to be that a party to a joint account in a building society should receive his or her fair division of any rights or entitlements that are due to that account.  That objective is commendable and I am sure is supported by everyone in this House.</P>
      <P>The key issue, however, is how this is best secured.  It is necessary, in particular, to ensure that the principle of equality and fairness of treatment is upheld for all members of a building society and that any measure designed to improve the position of joint account holders does not adversely affect the rights of other members, such as single account holders, or indeed have wider adverse implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill now before the House does not satisfy these essential requirements.  Its fundamental approach appears seriously defective <Col N="837" /> from a legal standpoint and, because of that, is not capable of being amended to provide a workable solution.  For these reasons, which I will elaborate further, the Government will not accept this Bill.</P>

However, the way in which this matter is approached would, in fact, give rise to much wider implications to which I will refer presently.

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The legal provisions relating to building societies are contained mainly in the Building Societies Act, I989, which provided a comprehensive modernisation of building society law, taking account particularly of changes in the mortgage market and developments in relation to company and banking legislation.  The I989 Act has provided a sound and successful framework for the orderly operation of building societies, helping them to develop and compete in a changing market, and allowing them to offer a wider range of services.  The success of the framework set down in the 1989 Act is reflected in the fact that for several years now we have had a plentiful supply of mortgage finance at very competitive rates.</P>
      <P>The I989 Act also contained a provision totally new to Irish building society legislation, enabling societies to convert to public limited companies, in effect becoming banks.  As Deputies will be aware, two societies have availed of this facility, Irish Permanent and First National, or, as it is now known, First Active.  This leaves us with only three building societies with the legal status of mutual societies.  It is in the context of the process of conversion that, it seems, the issues relating to the present Bill mainly lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to convert rests ultimately with <Col N="838" /> the shareholders and borrowing members of the society who must approve a conversion resolution on the basis of one person one vote.  The conversion must be confirmed by the Central Bank, which is the regulatory authority for building societies under the I989 Act.</P>
    <P>In common with other relevant legislative codes, including those governing building societies and companies, building society legislation has, since its beginning, made special provision in relation to joint accounts, in order to ensure clear-cut and effective procedures and fair and equal treatment between sole account holders and joint holders.  The I989 Act continued these provisions by, in effect, deeming the person whose name appears first in the records of the society to be the member of the society for various purposes under the Act, including voting, distribution of shares, issue of various documents, etc.  This procedure has a number of advantages. For example, it ensures that a joint account carries the same voting strength as a sole account, it helps to prevent duplicate share issues and minimises costs to societies and their members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that a similar procedure currently applies under the Companies Acts and is, as I have said, a long-standing principle dating back to much earlier legislation relating to friendly societies.</P>
      <P>Legislation on the lines now proposed would fundamentally alter this long-standing and widely applied principle.  This could have serious implications, not only for building societies, but also for companies, credit unions, and other types of organisations where the principle applies.  Any legislative change on the lines proposed should not be taken in isolation but needs to have regard to the broader implications for relevant legislative codes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;not least the Companies Acts.  As well as changing the procedure in relation to share entitlements in the event of conversion to plc status, the Bill would also change the procedure in relation to other entitlements under the building societies legislation including rights to receive communications from the society and, most importantly, voting rights.  Every individual named in a joint account would be deemed a member of the society having equal status with single account holders for such purposes.  In effect, a joint account with four named parties would have four times the voting weight of one single account.  I understand that currently anything up to 50 per cent of accounts in building societies are held jointly.  As with a sole account, the holders of a joint account are entitled to a total of one vote and the first named account holder is the member of the society for that purpose. It is, of course, entirely a matter for the persons <Col N="839" /> opening the account to decide who should be the first named account holder.</P>

      <P>The granting of voting rights and membership status to each joint account holder would represent a redistribution of benefits. In other words, the rights and benefits currently held by sole account holders would be diluted.  The relative value of one vote would diminish and, in the conversion scenario, the relative value of shares allocated to a sole account could be less than under existing practice.  The introduction of such a fundamental change to the established rights of an account holder raises serious questions in relation to that person's property rights under the Constitution.  It could also, in the view of the office of the Attorney General, infringe equality provisions of the Constitution by effectively giving more favourable voting rights to joint account holders than single account holders.</P>

If the concept of joint account holding were to be altered as proposed, the principle would also need to be considered in the context of the Companies Acts and insurance, banking and mutual society law generally. The overall implications in terms of business costs for companies, credit unions, etc.  could be significant.

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing legislation specifically entitles joint account holders or borrowers to decide the order of names in the records.  The opening of a joint account is an optional decision for the parties concerned.  Where a joint account is established and the order of names determined on a free and voluntary basis, it is not unreasonable to suppose that in the vast majority of cases the parties involved would agree in relation to resultant entitlements in terms of shares, voting rights or access to information.  Where disagreements might arise in the context of cases of divorce or judicial separation there is the possibility of settlement, for example, through property adjustment orders under the relevant legislation. Notwithstanding all of these factors, some situations could arise where a party to a joint account could suffer loss or difficulty.  It is not my intention to minimise the problem in such cases but it is necessary to get the extent of the issue into proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of building society law which caused real difficulty in the case of the Irish Permanent conversion was addressed in amendments made to the Building Societies Act, 1989, in the context of the Central Bank Act, 1997.  This involved a situation whereby some joint account holders lost out because of a technical anomaly. Perhaps the most severe example of this was the <Col N="841" /> case of widows who failed to qualify for shares because their husbands, who were first named on the joint account, died during the two year qualifying period for share entitlements.  As a result the account could not meet the two year qualifying requirement either in the name of the husband or the wife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>That was disgraceful.  Is that not what we are trying to amend now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This and other similar problems were rectified by amendments in the 1997 Act.  Section 78 of the 1997 Act amended the Building Societies Act, 1989, to ensure that joint shareholders, if otherwise eligible, qualify for free shares, and that the shares are not lost following the death of the first-named holder &mdash; to ensure that rights transferred to the second named, on the creation of a joint account, for example, on marriage, on the division of a joint account, for example, on divorce or separation, or where there was a change in the order of names within a joint account.</P>
      <P>This is a very technical provision which was designed, in the light of consultation with the Central Bank and the building societies, to ensure that all possible situations which need to be covered are dealt with and to avoid undesired side effects, such as the creation of duplicate entitlement to shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Did that not create a precedent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>This provision essentially ensures that a person who held a share account with the building society throughout the period necessary to qualify for entitlements on conversion and was the second or lower named person in a joint account for all or part of that period, will qualify for shares if no other person had priority entitlement to the shares.  The concept of priority was necessary to avoid the possibility of duplicate share issues.  The present Bill would undermine this principle and in the process would be likely to make the provision largely inoperable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no wonder they made mistakes if their computer cannot deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>An example of the sort of difficulty that the Bill would create in relation to the 1997 amendment is that, while sub-section 6(a) states that joint account holders shall share equally the shares in the society, sub-section 6(e) appears to provide otherwise, in saying that the shares shall be deemed to be held by each of the joint holders, which could imply that each would be entitled to a full share allocation on conversion rather than a proportion of the share issue in respect of the particular account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes made in the 1997 Act represented a major improvement in the legal framework governing the conversion of building societies and I understand the sort of problems that arose in connection <Col N="842" /> with the Irish Permanent conversion were not repeated in the recent First Active conversion. Ironically, there is a danger that the approach being proposed in the Bill could undermine or seriously distort the effect of the 1997 amendments of which this Bill does not take account.  Consequently, those whom the 1997 amendment was designed to benefit could lose out under this Bill in the event of any future conversions.</P>
    <P>I also have a concern that, by giving every party to a joint account the same voting rights as a single account holder, the Bill could distort the decision making process of a building society. This could, for example, facilitate any possible attempt to engineer the demutualisation of a society against the wishes of the majority of its existing members.  It could become easier for &ldquo;carpetbaggers&rdquo; opening new accounts to gain from conversion to plc status, as was attempted recently in the UK, to outvote opponents of demutualisation by opening joint accounts with multiple votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision as to whether any further building society conversions actually arise in the future lies in the hands of the directors and members of the remaining mutual building societies. The Government's role is to ensure there is an effective legal framework to regulate this area, with adequate safeguards for the building societies, successor companies formed as a result of conversions, protection of the interests of members of societies and the continuation of a competitive mortgage market based on a diversity of mortgage lenders.  One of the key safeguards lies in the protective provisions in section 102 of the Building Societies Act, 1989, for building societies converting to plc status which prevent any one person or institution holding 15 per cent or more of the shares in a building society for five years after conversion.</P>
      <P>This ensures that a society converting to plc status will not be exposed to take over within the five year period.  It also protects mutual building societies from speculative pressures to bring about a conversion with a view to a takeover. Without this provision there would be a serious risk of the loss of mutual building societies as a distinct sector in the mortgage market, with adverse consequences for the housing mortgage market, for house purchasers and for savers.  This would serve to weaken the present healthy competition between the banks and mutuals, would facilitate takeovers which would reduce the number of mortgage lending institutions, and would remove the cost and other advantages inherent in member-owned mutuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strong competition in the mortgage market, to which the mutual societies have made a significant <Col N="843" /> contribution, has greatly benefited borrowers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years we have experienced interest rates at lower levels than for several decades and in the approach to EMU further significant reductions in mortgage rates have come on stream.  These will provide welcome improvements in affordability, particularly for first time house buyers.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider how the objective of equitable sub-division of share entitlements for joint accounts might be secured through a workable approach, having regard to the implications for related codes such as the Companies Acts which have much wider application. The matter will be examined in consultation with the Attorney General and relevant interests including Government Departments and the Central Bank, which is the regulatory authority for building societies.  If it is found that this can best be achieved through a legislative response that would improve on the current provisions, while avoiding the sort of difficulties which the Bill would create, then the possibility of including appropriate provisions in some suitable forthcoming legislation will be looked at.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to accept that the intention behind this Bill is one of seeking fair treatment. However, the way it seeks to achieve this is likely to be at the expense of the rights and interests of many others.  I am sure Deputy Browne did not intend or would not wish for such an outcome.  I hope he will acknowledge that the Bill raises serious legal and practical difficulties and that he will accept my assurance that the matter will be examined to see if a more satisfactory approach can be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed all sides of the House would join in common purpose to correct a clear deficiency in the law which may have passed through a previous Dáil unnoticed.  In Private Members' business there are various examples of all-party agreement on motions and legislative change.  This has become more a feature than an exception in recent times.  I know there is a knee jerk reaction by Departments and civil servants to begin with the premise of rejection and then work out the logic afterwards.  Even that Luddite premise is wafer thin with the logic presented here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An extraordinary, clear and concise case was put forward by Deputy Browne of Carlow-Kilkenny in promoting a very simple amending Bill.  His own good constituency work identified a glaring anomaly in existing legislation.  He brought that example before the House in the way a legislator should.  We all spend more time than we should doing the non-legislative work of making representations, etc.  The real work we are here to do <Col N="844" /> is to find deficiencies in the law and seek to put them right.  When such glaring anomalies are identified it is reasonable to expect that such good legislative work will not be obstructed by the Government through arguments which clutch at straws and seem to be a throw back to a time I thought we had left behind.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Browne.  He has pursued exactly the correct legislative path.  A constituent identified a problem and he sought to have it rectified. It was pointed out to him that it was a legal problem which could only be rectified by introducing amending legislation.  Being a good legislator, he drafted a Bill and persuaded his party to provide Private Members' time, which is scarce, such is the concern of the House about the matter and such is the obviousness of the anomaly which must be addressed.  It behoves all of us to look at any such reforming measure with an open mind and heart.  It profoundly depresses me to hear the knee jerk automatic reaction of rejection.  It is profoundly upsetting that the merit of the case could not be parsed and analysed.  A wafer thin justification for rejection was produced instead of saying that an obvious anomaly had been highlighted and that we have an obligation as legislators to correct it.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is not perfect in every detail we should accept the principle of it as that is all that is being argued for tonight.  This is a debate on Second Stage.  The detail can be worked out on Committee Stage.  If there are aspects of the legislation which require amending then we can amend it.  We should accept the righteousness and principle of the case made, pass the Bill and let the anomalies, if there are such, be sorted out on Committee Stage.  Opposition Members do not have access either to the Parliamentary Draftsman or the Attorney General's legal advice. Therefore, it is possible that deficiencies can be identified.  However, we should recognise the validity of the case being made.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of fundamental justice.  It is just not good enough for the Minister to say the Bill could add substantially to the costs of building societies.  On that basis, why would we make separate pension payments to people if it results in an extra cost on the State?  Should we not pay all the money to the man and let him dole out a bit to the wife or anybody else?  Fundamental justice says people are equal and joint mortgage holders and not a combination of a mortgage holder and an also ran who cannot be given full information lest the cost of communications, as the Minister indicated, be too onerous on building societies.  It is throw back logic which should not be part of a debate in the House at the end of the millennium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Browne rightly said this is a fundamental issue of equality.  The Buildings Society Act, 1989, contained patronising clauses which viewed the man in a different light to the woman.  Largely, the man was the primary mortgagee <Col N="845" /> while the women was the inferior co-mortgagee. This was not universally the case: today I spoke to a woman who is the prime listed person on a mortgage document and whose husband is the disenfranchised one.  This is no less acceptable. We have come a long way in recognising the importance of the fundamental issue of equality. We can pay lip service to it in a number of ways &mdash; we all do &mdash; but the implementation of it sometimes costs money and puts institutions to some amount of bother.</P>
      <P>The previous Government, of which I had the honour of being a member, established the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The first Minister to hold that portfolio and to bring the equality agenda to the Cabinet in its full right was former Deputy Mervyn Taylor.  I pay great tribute to him as he was an advocate of equality who raised the issue of women's rights and the rights of the disadvantaged and disabled.  It was a matter of doing something fundamental in a Republic, namely, vindicating citizenship and establishing that all citizens of the Republic are equal regardless of cost or inconvenience.  It is sometimes an inconvenience to put ramps into public buildings, to design buildings so that they are accessible and to ensure footpaths can be negotiated by people who are visually impaired or who have difficulties in movement.  However, I do not think the Minister or anybody else in the House would suggest that we do not make such provision on the basis that it would be inconvenient, expensive, difficult, troublesome or bothersome.  I am surprised the Minister has done this in the case of the Bill which has been put forward.</P>
      <P>Former Deputy Mervyn Taylor set out a fundamental principle which imbued the Government and each member of it &mdash; he was permanently there to ensure we all toed the line.  The principle which imbued that Government and which was promulgated incessantly by Mervyn Taylor was that of gender proofing legislation.  Whatever proposal we had, there was a requirement in every memorandum which went to Government &mdash; a clause which said: &ldquo;implications for women&rdquo;.  If women were disadvantaged by any clause, it had to be identified.  That brought about a different way of thinking because I assure the House that no member of the Government ever brought forward a memorandum which clearly disadvantaged women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original Building Societies Act, 1989, was obviously introduced in the days before gender proofing and Mervyn Taylor's good work had such effect.  Because it was enacted before gender proofing and equality became immutable facts does not mean it should not be revisited.  We have an obligation to revisit it and to ensure the principles of equality not only impact on legislation which is current, but also on legislation enacted in the past.  This type of patronising view must be addressed where the opportunity presents itself as it does this evening in a very simple and clear presentation by Deputy Browne which should be <Col N="846" /> supported by all sides.  It grieves me that it is not. We are not talking about issues which cannot be addressed in committee.  Any of the points made by the Minister which hold weight at all can be addressed in a committee debate and by amendment.</P>
    <P>A number of fundamental issues arise in a discussion of this type.  The first issue, which was raised by Deputy Barnes, is the difficulties experienced down through the years as regards the fundamental right of private property which has stopped social progress in a number of areas.  The arguments put forward by the Minister in terms of Article 41 of the Constitution and his indication about significant constitutional doubts is the type of language used to oppose the Family Home Protection Act.  If that logic had prevailed, there would be no Family Home Protection Act and many women would have been dreadfully disadvantaged.  That is old legislation and that thinking has been left behind.  We cannot allow artificial barriers to get in the way of rectifying anomalies in law which disadvantage women or any citizen.</P>
    <P>On a linked issue, I asked the Tánaiste on today's Order of Business where the Government's proposal on the abolition of ground rents stands and the same response was given to me. Although it is part of the programme for Government and is included in the legislative list circulated for this session, it will never appear.  That was not said in so many words but clearly the Tánaiste said there were constitutional difficulties because of the absolute right of private property. These are difficulties about which we have known for 20 years, when the programme for Government was drafted and certainly when the legislative programme for this session was drafted.  The will of this House, shared by Deputies on all sides, to abolish ground rents will not be implemented because of that constitutional difficulty which seems like a barrier, in so many instances, to social progress.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes instanced the decades of disadvantage women have endured because of that being cited as a problem.  We have an obligation to be brave on many of these issues.  If we want to give equal treatment to our citizens, let us do that and allow somebody to take a constitutional case to strike it down.  In this instance, I do not believe anybody would want to oppose the principles of Deputy Browne's Bill.  Does anybody believe that where there are joint mortgagees the first named should have all the benefits, voting rights and shares and the second named, most often the woman, should have none?  I do not believe anyone would argue that is fair or just. Most people would see it as an anomaly in the law, a simple matter to be rectified and an issue which would cause no difficulty in terms of political consensus and which could be resolved in a day's work by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>That is why I could only describe some of the rhetoric in the Minister's speech as hogwash.  I instance the paragraph in which he states that <Col N="847" /> fundamental restructuring of computer and information systems would be needed which would be likely to require very considerable time and expense in addition to the cost of communicating with every joint account holder on an ongoing basis.  God help us.  It would be such a terrible burden that they might have to write to people who are their mortgagees.</P>

      <P>I do not believe the Minister is serious in that, or believes it.  We have the Internet, global communications and the information superhighway so the building societies can afford a few extra stamps.  They could communicate with their joint shareholders and mortgagees as effectively as they would with the first named on the account.  Let us put them to the test and see if they would be so brave as to take it on as an act of solidarity and equality.  As he spoke those words, the Minister must have had his tongue in his cheek because I do not believe he believes that type of convoluted logic and patronising throw back to a bygone time holds any water.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright called for an Ombudsman for the building societies.  In the instances he quoted, he made a convincing case.  It is clear that more families deal with the building societies and a significant proportion of family income is expended on paying the mortgage and protecting the roof over the family household.  In those circumstances, we have to monitor carefully all the building societies do.  There have been instances which have been carefully selected and presented to us tonight by Deputy Enright concerning the practices of individual building societies in individual cases about which everyone in this House would raise an eyebrow.  A good case was made by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>That remit must go beyond the building societies because the greatest rip-off, if such a phrase may be used in the House, concerns those paying HFA mortgages to local authorities.  There is a huge and significant disparity between the rate of interest charged to mortgagees of the local authority Housing Finance Agency accounts and those available in the commercial sector.  Many people do not know that and could be paying 8.5 per cent or more.</P>
      <P>I saw a case this week with interest rates of 8.5 per cent while under 6 per cent is available in the commercial sector.  Because of the structure of the Housing Finance Agency loans, money was borrowed expensively and repaid expensively and is being carried by the poorest sector.  By definition, to get the Housing Finance Agency loan, one had to be rejected by the commercial sector. For the privilege of being too poor to get a commercial loan, one is expected to repay a greater rate than those who are wealthier and in receipt of a commercial loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible to remortgage, pay off the Housing <Col N="848" /> Finance Agency loan and obtain a commercial loan instead.  Most local authorities are very facilitating in this regard and I encouraged it during my time as Minister.  Many people are unaware of this, and perhaps the Minister should respond to the point by issuing a circular requiring each local authority which grants loans to advise its mortgagees that a lower commercial rate is probably available to them and to advise them how to go about obtaining it.  I hope it can be done without great cost.  It should be examined.</P>
    <P>If competition in the mortgage business is important to the Minister, a start should be made in the area for which he has direct responsibility. The Housing Finance Agency and local authorities are directly under his remit and they charge the highest rate of interest with no significant competition.  It is something to which I would dearly love the Minister to respond, and perhaps he may do that through another Government speaker saying such a circular will be issued.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the Bill was unamendable. No Bill is such if the principle of amendment is accepted.  For example, an amendment could be tabled to delete all words after &ldquo;Building Society (Amendment) Bill, 1998&rdquo; and to insert new sections.  The last Bill with which I dealt which was deemed unamendable was the Electoral Act. When I introduced it to the House, the spokes-person for the Progressive Democrats, lamentably no longer a Member of the House, described it as being so bad as to be unamendable. His Fianna Fáil counterpart said most of it would be repealed as soon as Fianna Fáil came into office.  While they did so sooner than I expected, the Bill was enacted in full and not one line was deleted, repealed or amended by the new Government, which ironically comprised the two parties, one of which said it would repeal much of it and the other which found it unamendable. Therefore, I am not impressed by such language.</P>
    <P>The Minister should re-examine the issue and he has some time to do so.  It is an extremely important issue although the argument could be made that it does not impact on a significant number of people.  I do not know if Deputy Browne has had the chance to conduct an audit, but he would be surprised to hear of the number of people disadvantaged by the current legislation. I am sure it is a considerable number, many of whom are probably unaware they are disadvantaged.  It is our job to identify that and to do right by them.  I invite the Minister to think again.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with one aspect of building societies but I also want to draw to the Minister's attention a document which I know is in his Department and which was discussed by the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government.  It is entitled &ldquo;Affordable Accommodation &mdash; A Trade Union Issue and a Human Right&rdquo; which was published jointly by the trade unions, CPSU and SIPTU.  It contains an analysis of affordable accommodation and is an extraordinarily <Col N="849" /> good document which is not only worth reading but largely worthy of implementation.  In terms of building societies, there are two specific recommendations which might be taken on board if this Bill were enacted.  They could be examined as amendments to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The action plan of recommendations, contained at the conclusion of the report, can be adopted to address one of the gravest social problems facing people in this tiger economy concerned about having a roof over their heads.  The figures are stark and bleak.  We can talk of booming societies but any society which tolerates a local authority waiting list of 45,800 and which, according to Threshold, has up to 6,000 homeless people living on its streets is not a healthy one. The recommendations for tackling this need to be taken seriously and to be acted upon.  It is not good enough to examine one aspect, as the Bacon report did, and to then say enough has been done. Clearly that is not the case.  Houses and their purchase are now beyond the ability of a huge number of people in society who always expected to be in a position to buy them because they earned good wages, but who cannot now enter the market due to the cost of a basic home, especially in cities.  The Minister should examine the recommendations as they pertain to building societies, specifically two.</P>
    <P>Recommendation No. 19 examines the role of building societies and other financial institutions in the provision of soft loans to housing trusts, co-ops or voluntary agencies.  Recommendation No. 22, which is extremely important, calls for a code of practice to be drawn up to protect people who have purchased houses at current inflated prices and who subsequently experience difficulties in making repayments.  In such situations, the option of lengthening the duration of the mortgage should be an alternative to repossession.  That is something which must be examined.  If the financial circumstances of people who are put to the pin of their collar to pay a large mortgage change and they can no longer carry that extraordinarily demanding burden, there must be another option available to them than repossession.  It is the norm in other societies.  I recommend this document highly to the Minister and I know it is in his Department.  I do not seek to trespass the issue of affordable accommodation into the debate but it is the most critical social issue we face.  The Government has not faced up to it and I expect it to be mindful of the need of so many in society.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires equality in the conduct of building societies in the issues of shares, voting rights and communication to shareholders.  I listened carefully to every word spoken by the Minister in his presentation and have reread his speech since.  There is no justification for not accepting this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. I plead with the Minister to accept the case put forward.  It is an unanswerable case for equality and any difficulties in the text can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I urge the Minister to change his view and ensure the next Government <Col N="850" /> speaker reverses the outdated, outmoded and anti-equality line taken by the Minister.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, I welcome this Bill.  I certainly welcome the motivation behind it.  I am conscious that the Committee of Public Accounts has done a great deal of good work in the past six or eight weeks since this matter was first aired in <i>Magill.</i>  It has been grasping seriously to find a way in which to deal with this issue within the confines of the House without the need to establish a tribunal.</P>
      <P>I have some doubts about the Bill and about individual provisions.  Some of my doubts to which I will give expression later go to the roots of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the thrust of what we are trying to achieve.  We are trying to establish the facts and what happened and whether an arrangement was reached between the Revenue and AIB and, if so, the nature of that arrangement, and whether full disclosure was made by both sides as part of that arrangement.  That is an important part of what we are trying to do.  We are also trying to ensure there is full accounting for any tax liability that arose in the 1980s.  Before closing this chapter it is important that we know that full account has been given in relation to the liability to the Exchequer for all taxes due at that stage.</P>
      <P>It is important, in fairness to AIB &mdash; the institution which has been the target of so much criticism &mdash; to establish whether other financial institutions, other banks in particular, were also guilty of the same scam and were part of the culture which, by all accounts, appears to have been widespread in the financial sector at the time.  We have read on a number of occasions in the intervening two months or so about allegations, generally unspecific, that other financial institutions, including banks, were involved in the same culture.  In fairness to AIB and all concerned it is important to establish if that was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of what we are doing must be, as Marie Antoinette said, <i>encourager les autres</i>, to ensure something like this becomes a good deal less likely in the future.  In a sense, we have here a collective luxury in that we are doing something which does not and cannot have an immediate impact on the financial sector.  It will not affect people's confidence in the bank in a tangible way.  We are looking at something which happened six or seven years ago and which most of us assume is now finished but it is important to ensure it does not happen again.  The reason <Col N="851" /> we are doing it in this way is to avoid another beef tribunal and we want to investigate the matter in a quicker and less formal way and, indirectly to give some teeth to committees of Dáil Eireann when they choose to go about investigations of public matters in this way.</P>
    <P>I am in some difficulty because we have unwittingly created a tribunal by another name.  We have created a hybrid arrangement whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General is effectively given the powers of the chairman of a tribunal and has been asked to produce a report which the committee can endorse.  I say &ldquo;endorse&rdquo; because it is difficult for the committee to do anything else.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is being given legal powers.  He is obliged to observe due process, to administer the law as he sees it, but in a fair way, to all concerned and to look at all the facts.  He will set out the facts in a report which will be laid before the House and the committee. The committee is then empowered to reach conclusions based on those facts.</P>
    <P>There would be a real difficulty if the committee were to decide to reach conclusions different from those set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report or to reject, alter or accept only some facts set out in the report.  In short, it would be difficult for the committee in those circumstances to legally and properly act in any way, other than as a rubber stamp for what the Comptroller and Auditor General concludes.  If that is to be the case, what is the difference between the Comptroller and Auditor General's operation and what would be done by the chairman of a tribunal except that in all cases the Comptroller and Auditor General would operate in private whereas a tribunal, based on previous experience, would be in public?  I am not sure the cause of Dáil committees is substantially advanced by taking this route, if the committees are confined to the role of a rubber stamp.  The members of the committee simply do not have the time or, perhaps, even the inclination to sit in a quasi judicial way to consider all the facts as carefully as they might and, dare I say it, it is not impossible that some members of the committee may vote on some conclusions without properly reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  If this happens there will be real problems. Litigants or people whose reputations might be in some way damaged, such as the banks, would have little difficulty in impugning a report of that kind and, perhaps, of fatally wounding such a report.</P>
    <P>This is a flaw, if the argument I am making is accepted, which necessarily runs to all investigations of this kind and not only this one.  I hope I am wrong in that but it strikes me as an obvious problem.  Perhaps the matter can be teased out later.</P>
    <P>Essentially I am asking questions and I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to respond. I join Deputy Noonan in saying I am frustrated at the limited time in which to discuss this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> There are a number of provisions in it which sail close to the wind in terms of the Constitution.  To be asked to get through Committee Stage in an hour this evening, is not good enough.  We may well regret that.</P>
    <P>There is an argument &mdash; I do not necessarily accept it &mdash; that the Comptroller and Auditor General as an established independent agent in the Constitution cannot be given additional powers by statute.  The Minister will be aware the Constitution precisely defines what the Comptroller and Auditor General will do.  It is argued by constitutional lawyers that one cannot simply, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, give him additional powers.  I will be interested to hear what advice the Minister has been given because I am aware the issue has been addressed in the advice offered.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that utterances of members of the committee made outside of the committee are entitled to absolute privilege.  There is a serious constitutional problem here.  It can be argued that parliamentary privilege is a constitutional construct.  It is set out in the Constitution as such.  The Constitution specifically provides that the utterances of Members within the House are privileged.  This has been extended, quite properly, to what may be said by Members at committees of the House of which they are members.  I do not see how that can be extended with any ease by statute to anything which a member of a committee says outside the House, whether in pursuit of their function as a member of that committee.</P>
    <P>The memorandum which accompanies the Bill specifically states that utterances on television and radio are not covered.  The Bill does not say that.  The Bill covers all utterances made by members of the committee in pursuit of their functions as members of the committee.  As a public representative and if I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I would be entitled to say that giving interviews on radio were in pursuit of my function as a member of the committee and that I could draw on the absolute privilege which appears to be given to members of the committee in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I was on Vincent Browne's radio programme with Deputy Ardagh a number of weeks ago and we discussed a number of these issues.  Is Deputy Ardagh, as a member of the committee, entitled to absolute privilege in respect of everything he says while someone such as myself, who is not a member of the committee, is not entitled to privilege at all?  If that is the conclusion which could be drawn, this is not a healthy state of affairs.</P>
    <P>One of the provisions in section 9 appears to contain a constitutional infirmity.  If a person disobeys an instruction by an auditor, the provision in question allows the Comptroller to involve the High Court which may hold a summary hearing and punish the person as if he or she were guilty of contempt of court.  It strikes me that this cannot be done.  The Minister will be familiar with <Col N="853" /> the In re Haughey case in the early 1970s, which seemed to be based on similar circumstances, where the Supreme Court concluded without difficulty that the High Court is not a court of summary jurisdiction and that it cannot try someone for a criminal offence without a jury.  It could be argued that, as constructed, the Bill does not provide for criminal offences.  However, it uses the word &ldquo;punish&rdquo; which is not suitable when referring to civil contempt.  We are clearly discussing criminal contempt.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that provision because it seems to fall into the same category as the In re Haughey decision.</P>
    <P>I am interested to know why the Bill allows for the appointment of auditors.  The original reason for granting this power to the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office was that there existed within that office a capacity and an expertise in dealing with matters of financial regulation, the expenditure of money, etc.  In that context, it seems strange to give the Comptroller the power to go outside his office to employ additional people to do precisely the work we thought him to be skilled at doing in the first instance.  I do not understand the need for this provision.  Trying to read between the lines and not having been privy to the briefings which were given in recent weeks, it appears this is being done for a legal reason to, in some way, keep the discharge of that function at arm's length from the Comptroller and the members of the committee.</P>
    <P>I understood earlier that it was intended, through the resolution, that, when the report was made available to him, the Clerk of the Dáil would be obliged to effectively sit on it for two weeks before releasing it to Members.  This was intended to facilitate the committee in taking ownership of the report in the interim.  However, that is not stated in the resolution and perhaps the Minister will clarify the position later.</P>
    <P>Section 16 deals with utterances or documents in the ownership of a committee which are not discussed in public session.  The section places an absolute prohibition on the disclosure of those utterances or documents without the permission of the chairman.  This provision appears to apply to all committees and is not one of those provisions which lapses with the resolution.  I do not understand the reasoning behind this.  There seems to be a view among the members of certain committees that what they do behind closed doors is their business.  I would prefer to start from the opposition principle.  What is done in these Houses, whether in committee or otherwise, is the public's business and we require a good reason to keep it to ourselves.  Any notion that we should include in the Bill a provision which would draw a veil of secrecy over everything that is done by committees &mdash; including, for example, compiling reports &mdash; is wrong in principle.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that I support what the Minister is attempting to achieve.  However, I am concerned that we have created a hybrid which may not <Col N="854" /> serve our purposes.  Perhaps we should reconsider the functions of Dáil committees and the sort of matters we should be using them to investigate. When dealing with criminal or potential criminal offences, Dáil committees should be slow to tread into such territory.  Those matters are best left to the Judiciary because, sooner or later, that body will be obliged to deal with them.  We must give consideration to more carefully defining the matters of public interest which are to be dealt with by Dáil committees and the way in which they go about their business.  I am not persuaded that the <i>ad hoc</i> legislation before the House represents the sort of template we should use in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a distinct sense of <i>déja vu</i> because the House has discussed the role of parliamentary committees on many occasions during the past 25 years.  The public must be utterly mystified at our incapacity to decide what is the appropriate role of those committees and to give to them and the House and its Members the opportunity to do the job with which we are charged in the Constitution.  It is ridiculous that the House has been obliged to return again to this topic.  The previous speaker rightly referred to the issues which arise in the context of the In re Haughey case, the constitutional circumstances that surrounded it and the difficulties successive Administrations have had to address in the past 25 or 26 years.</P>
      <P>The political will to resolve these issues has been displayed by the current Administration and a number of its recent predecessors.  However, I am mystified by our failure to draw together sufficient legal expertise from all sides and from the permanent Civil Service to reach a permanent and agreeable solution on this matter.</P>
      <P>In the early 1970s the inadequacies of the powers enjoyed by committees of the House were fully explored.  There is an abundance of Dáil debates available on the issue.  Action was promised and the possibility of holding a referendum to deal with the constitutional issues, some of which were touched upon by Deputy McDowell, was raised.  A great deal of political noise was made but, when the heat of the debate dissipated, no action was taken.  As a Member of the House, a person who is passionately interested in the work of committees, a taxpayer and a citizen, I am mystified by our failure to resolve these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I would prefer it to be permanent and, like other speakers, I hope we have resolved the various conundrums regarding how we should deal with this matter.  In the 1980s, as chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, I produced a special report &mdash; I believe it was the second or third of its kind &mdash; outlining the inadequacies of committees and the questions that raised.  The Dáil and Seanad debated the report and it was endorsed by all parties in both Houses.  However, because of the intractable nature <Col N="855" /> of the issues we raised, no solution has been offered until today.</P>
    <P>Whether we consider the solution produced by the Minister adequate or inadequate, we must give him and his officials credit for going some way towards resolving some of the problems which seem to prevent Oireachtas committees from fully and properly investigating circumstances of a questionable nature.  With regard to Deputy McDowell's final comment &mdash; I say this in no patronising way because his contribution was thoughtful and provocative and I am sure it will prompt a response from the Minister &mdash; it seems there is a fundamental difference between the task of adjudication, the job of the Judiciary, and the task of investigation, which I regard as appropriate to an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>The circumstances which led to this measure are extraordinary and remarkable.  Two issues arise from those circumstances, the mechanism for conducting an investigation which is central to the Bill and the manner in which the issues became public knowledge.  I will deal with the latter issue first.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that we have had to depend on the media to highlight an extraordinary state of affairs.  One must ask what would have happened if the <i>Magill</i> article had not highlighted the extraordinary situation regarding bogus accounts in Allied Irish Banks.  As Deputy McDowell stated, to be fair to Allied Irish Banks, this matter may involve other financial institutions, we do not know the exact position in that regard.  I cannot comprehend how the holding of up to 14,000 bogus DIRT accounts in one branch of Allied Irish Banks, in Tralee, went without being noticed by either of the two watchdogs appointed by the State, namely, the Revenue Commissioners and the Central Bank.  The former Minister for Foreign Affairs is based in Tralee.  I am certain he was anxious to attract business to his home town &mdash; I would do likewise &mdash; but it could only happen in Ireland that a relatively small branch of a bank would have up to 14,000 bogus DIRT accounts and nobody noticed.  That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>I hope the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General will be able to resolve the conflict in the evidence produced by the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and Allied Irish Bank.  Will they be in a position to discover why the Central Bank and the Revenue Commissioners did not move before the article appeared in <i>Magill?</i> That is the question to which I and other Members await an answer with considerable interest.</P>
    <P>While I wholeheartedly welcome the proposed measures, I am frustrated and disappointed that they are not permanent.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General perform an important role in regard to the responsibilities Bunreacht na hÉireann and its predecessor place on Dáil Éireann.  The control of the public purse is one of the most important <Col N="856" /> roles given to Parliament.  Eighty years after the first Dáil was elected and 50 years after Bunreacht na hÉireann outlined the modern responsibilities of Dáil Éireann &mdash; the control of public moneys, public expenditure and the patrimony of the nation &mdash; we are gingerly exploring yet again once-off measures to give temporary powers to the taxpayer's watchdog.  That is a failure of all Administrations since 1972-3 when these issues were raised in the Haughey case.  The Committee of Public Accounts is spancilled and blindfolded and has had its teeth capped.  It is a joke.  Were it not for the efforts of the members of the committee who are willing to expend considerable energy in the service of the State it would be a chatter shop with no useful purpose to serve.</P>
    <P>When this Bill runs its course we will return to that situation.  I have to ask why.  The <i>Magill</i> revelations were remarkable by any measure but they are not the only queries to have arisen recently about the manner in which State assets have been handled.  For seven of the last 12 months I have sought to focus the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the circumstances surrounding the disposal by the Department with responsibility for energy of up to 140 acres of land at Glen Ding, Blessington without the invitation of tenders, a competition, an attempt to establish a market price for the land or an effort to explore the value of the sand and gravel contained thereon.  A potential buyer was obstructed, discouraged and given misleading information by public officials.  When he pressed to be allowed purchase the land he was falsely informed that it had been sold.  It was only when he made a political intervention that he discovered that it had not been sold.  If I had a suspicious mind, I would suggest there was evidence of wrongdoing.  I compliment the Committee of Public Accounts on trying to discover how the issue could be examined.</P>
    <P>If we were in a position to give real powers to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, we could create a situation where a citizen or Deputy who is concerned about the manner in which an asset of the State has been handled could properly refer it for investigation.  The Bill is welcome because it allows us to proceed with the task in hand.  The House should return to this issue in the new year and explore precisely what it is we wish the committees to do and devolve finally to them the powers they need to get on with the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with much of what has been said on all sides of the House.  I also pay tribute to the Minister and his backup staff in a number of offices in causing this legislation to be introduced as pledged.  I agree with the remarks made on all sides of the House that it is most regrettable that we are discussing legislation as complex as this at short notice at the eleventh hour of the Dáil term.  I hope we do not live to regret it. <Col N="857" /> Deputy McDowell has identified some of the constitutional pitfalls which may be at issue.  What is at issue is the efficacy of Dáil committees to conduct inquiries compared to tribunals of inquiry.  If we fail, we will do serious damage to the notion that a committee of the House is capable of conducting an inquiry such as this.  I agree with Deputy Roche that, even though there is complex legislation on the Statute Book which interacts, we still have not got it right.  This is unknown terrain and we do not know what the outcome will be.  It is phenomenally complex.</P>
      <P>It is not the same as the Wallace committee, of which Deputy McDowell was a member.  I do not know how that committee could reasonably have been expected to make findings of fact given that the issue was partisan political by definition.  This is not a partisan political issue.  It is, as Deputy Roche said, an issue that goes to the fundamentals of our democracy.  It is about the efficacy of the procedures to collect tax and the alleged evasion of tax by at least one major financial institution. According to that institution, the practice was industry wide.</P>
      <P>I cannot think of anything more important.  It is not a question of the Opposition pointing a finger at the Minister for Finance or his predecessor and saying this is their fault and that we have to inquire into the matter from a political perspective.  It is a non-political issue.  If the House fails on this occasion to bring the bacon home, we will do serious damage to the concept that a committee of the House is capable of conducting an inquiry such as this.</P>
      <P>We should have more time to tease out the implications of the Bill.  I do not know how much time the Minister has spent on it.  I have not been immersed in it for as long as the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and learned something new this evening about which I have serious questions.  It may well be that they can be answered but they are serious questions.  Anyone who has been a Minister will say that one cannot know these things unless one is personally involved in their detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, before this evening I was under the impression that we were seeking to have conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General powers analogous to an inspector appointed by, for example, the High Court under the Companies Acts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General already has the power to go into a public sector organisation and find out what he will.  He may demand to see papers, question people and make his findings.  He does not have a similar power to go into private sector organisations but by conferring on him powers analogous to a High Court inspector under the Companies Acts we would give him such powers.  I now find that we are not conferring any such powers on the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In fact, while he may not be expressly disbarred from entering a bank or financial institution, he is effectively disbarred because under section 2(1)(c) he must carry out <Col N="858" /> such an investigation at arm's length, employing an auditor for the purpose.</P>
    <P>My understanding, up to now, was that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not use these powers to investigate individual accounts but would be able to access the internal audit reports of a bank or other documents such as minutes of meetings.  It now emerges, if I am reading the Bill correctly, that he may not.  I would like the Minister to address this point which raises a number of practical problems.  Is it possible in this jurisdiction to find an auditor who will not have a potential conflict of interest in such a situation?  One may search and find an auditor who has never done work for any of the financial institutions but what if, in the course of his investigation, he finds the non-resident account of a businessman of substance to whom he has given advice?  Must he go back to the Comptroller and Auditor General and say that although he cannot state his reason he must abandon the investigation?  A number of practical logistical problems are posed.</P>
    <P>However, of more concern to the members of the Committee of Public Accounts is the revelation that the Comptroller and Auditor General in whom we repose great confidence because of his track record and skill could, up to now, do this work for us.  The Minister kindly said that because of our onerous duties as parliamentarians we could not do this work ourselves.  That is not the case.  We would be quite happy to do the work but we do not think it appropriate to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(c) must be explained.  The Minister must also explain if there is a facility for the members and Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts to get access to the report so that they can make a considered and cogent response before we find ourselves answering soundbite questions from the media.  It must be possible for the Government to accept an amendment which will enable us to do that.  The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts made the important point that the committee should have the right to resort to the High Court in the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Roche that it is not acceptable that we pass <i>ad hoc</i> legislation which will fade as soon as the case is over, in the manner of people dealing with a bush fire.  We will never provide an alternative to tribunals in Dublin Castle if that is how we do our business.  Deputy McDowell raised a number of interesting constitutional issues, not least the one concerning privilege. Deputy Roche is right in saying it is perfectly practicable for the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out the investigation and for the members of the committee to take his report and make findings of fact such as they will, based on his report.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche has made a worthy contribution in the House and on a wider level as an academic and lecturer in public administration. <Col N="859" /> I have read much of what he has written on public administration issues and there is good sense in it and in what he said in this debate.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not make a permanent change in the investigative procedures and privileges employed by the House.  It is, by definition, a temporary arrangement to investigate a series of specific allegations concerning the Revenue Commissioners and their relationship with Allied Irish Banks and further allegations about other financial institutions.  It is also intended to discover if they are exposed or involved to the same extent as has been publicly revealed in relation to Allied Irish Banks.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will consider revisiting the issue of the institutional reform of this House.  I made my maiden speech at a time of great controversy about politics and the nature of politics.  We all know of the public tribunals which were set up to investigate the beef industry and allegations concerning the activities of former and serving Members of the House.  It is important that we, the representatives of the body politic, take the investigative role which we have imposed on ourselves very seriously.  The first parliament of the French Revolution was referred to as the grand inquest of the nation.  If we are to fill that aspirational role which parliamentarians sometimes set themselves we must get our committee procedures right.  It is agreed on all sides tonight, as it has been for a number of years, that our privileges and the powers of our committees are not appropriate to a modern democracy facing a new century.  I implore all Members to revisit this issue in the manner expressed by Deputy Roche. We must reform the Oireachtas because if we do not we will become irrelevant and people will constantly seek the advice of lawyers.  We have found it is not good that public debate be left in the hands of lawyers.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell has expressed a number of reservations about the Bill.  I assume he is worried about the temporary creature which will be born if the Bill is passed.  The legislation is temporary and it will be watched and re-examined in the fullness of time.  Nothing could be more politically sensitive or subversive than the questions of who pays tax, when they pay it and how they pay it or the question of whether equity is accorded to everyone under the taxation system and whether the balance of equity is maintained between individual and corporate citizens.  The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am proud to be a member, has taken the ball and run with it and decided that it wishes to investigate this matter to the fullest extent in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell, who is present, has done an excellent job in this regard.  The Committee is non-partisan in its focus.  It does not preach or talk in a political manner.  It conducts its business in a non-political and non-partisan manner and pursues the taxpayers' interest, particularly as it applies to the public sector and the spending of <Col N="860" /> taxpayers' money.  This investigation, which we have begun, does not only involve a public taxation issue, but the complicated issue of banks and other institutions which are charged with collecting taxpayers' money.  The question that cuts to the quick is how well or badly they did that. That is where the complications, legal and constitutional, arise.  Deputy McDowell, who is a lawyer, is aware there are pitfalls.  It may be the case that an individual or a body corporate may choose to challenge these powers or challenge the investigation while it is in progress.  We have seen that elsewhere in regard to tribunals, but it is important to underline that there is cross party support and support from the Minister, the Cabinet and the Government, to pursue these allegations to the nth degree.  If we are challenged, we will have to come back here and overcome it in whatever way we can.  If we cannot overcome it, it will have to be passed to someone else to investigate it.</P>
    <P>There are complications here because the allegations we are investigating about the AIB and the Revenue Commissioners are in regard to what has been described by AIB executives as an informal arrangement that was industry wide. They have suggested in their hearings before the Committee that there was some sort of informal arrangement, whereby they could play out their tax obligations.  That is a serious suggestion, all the more so, because at that stage the banks were in charge of collecting a particular tax.  If that is so, it will cause major concern.  Nothing can be more politically subversive than the issue of taxation and its collection, given the high taxation environment through which we have come.</P>
    <P>That was the substance of the dispute in the Committee.  AIB suggested there was an industry wide deal, informal though it may have been, of which it was part, but the Revenue Commissioners said the opposite.  It is important tax-payers get this message.  The Revenue Commissioners are pursuing to the fullest degree the liability they believe is due, but there is a conflict. It is no accident Mr. Mulcahy, when replying to me and others on the Committee, stated he was in discussions with the Revenue Commissioners. He did not put it further than that.  Discussions are taking place parallel to this investigative process of inquiry by Parliament whereby the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a liability which they believe is justly due to them.  The tax collectors are charged on behalf of the public to collect taxes.  That is what further complicates this issue.</P>
    <P>I praise the Government and the Minister, not only on the budget in terms of taxation provisions, but on the powers that have been produced quickly for this investigation.  Members have stated it might have been better if we had been given more time, but time is not on our side. There may be a settlement between the Revenue Commissioners and AIB, and taxpayers' legitimate interest in inquiring and finding out more about this arrangement may be lost.  It is <Col N="861" /> important we get down to work relatively rapidly and try and test the powers available to us.  These powers are not final and they will not necessarily be a guidebook for the future.  They are one set of legal devices given to the House on an issue of enormous political importance.  We will have to revisit the issue of the powers available to this House in the long-term.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Committee, and I note other members of it have contributed, it is important that we should be careful of the language we use because ultimately the Committee will sit in some sort of quasi judicial role in regard to the investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we will have to make some determinations about it.  That behoves us all to be very careful about what we say here and not to be party political in our interpretation of any evidence we get.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that we should avoid comparison with the Wallace Committee. It was generous and investigated something which, by its nature, was politically charged.  It was an inquiry that had highly political overtones and we may not find out about the truth or lack of it that emerged because of the downfall of the then Government in 1994.  History may have to cast judgment on that when files are opened and declassified.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Gormley.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty in regard to the short period we have to make our contributions.  Like other Members, who are also members of the Committee of Public Accounts, I have considerable reservations about the Bill.  I do not see it as a bridge too far but as a bridge that goes only half way, a bridge that does neither one thing nor the other.  This Bill purports to give powers to the committee, which it may or may not be in a position to use and to use such powers the Members would be out of the House in committee for months on end, which is impossible and impractical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With no disrespect to my friends in the legal profession, I said in private, and I have no hesitation about saying it in public, that given existing powers drawn from the Constitution, the Committee of Public Accounts is unique and it need not apologise, any more than does this House, to any quarter.  As we saw in the past this House has been able to forage in areas that are the preserve of other institutions, often the courts.  In many cases in the past we saw that where there was a conflict of interest the <i>sub judice</i> rule was invoked or ignored.  The Committee could well have done its job with its existing powers and it could have proceeded to encourage witnesses to appear before it and give evidence.  At some stage somebody would have shouted halt and said the Committee had extended beyond its remit.  That may have been the case, but on this issue it should be understood that a particular institution came voluntarily before the Committee and gave evidence. <Col N="862" /> Because of that, an obligation fell on anyone else who stood on the sideline or who was directly or indirectly involved, to come before the Committee or withdraw on whatever basis they wanted to put forward.  Given that one group, Allied Irish Banks, came forward voluntarily and openly gave evidence, I do not see why any other group should refuse to do so.  If someone wanted to mislead or run circles around the Committee, there would be a problem, but if someone wanted to come forward and give honest and factual evidence, I do not see any difficulty in that or in the Committee operating outside its remit.</P>
    <P>My worry about the proposed legislation is that it will do something in relation to a specific subject matter, which has been discussed, but I do not know what it will do.  I do not know if it is a general or a specific provision, but it seems to be a specific one.  I do not know if we will have to seek to introduce similar legislation to deal with other issues.  The Wallace Committee was a very different committee with different powers drawn from a different institution of the State.  This Bill is a one off measure that will enable the Committee to go down a particular route, which will be soul destroying for the members of the Committee, whoever they may be, when this investigation is at an end.  I may be proven wrong but that is my concern.  I served approximately ten years on that committee, but there are longer serving members who have greater experience.</P>
    <P>There have been two legal challenges in the past 60 or 70 years.  It is an extraordinary record that for all the controversial issues which have come before committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly the Committee of Public Accounts, the number of legal challenges has been reduced to the minimum, especially at a time when litigation is rampant.</P>
    <P>As regards the compellability of witnesses, I do not see any difficulty with a witness who is called before a committee or a Member of this House saying something they believe is true.  Nobody in the State could challenge their right to do that. We should not devolve powers to other institutions which circumvent or restrict the rights of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas to do their job to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill does the job it was intended to do and that it does not bury the members of the committee for months as they pursue issues which capable legal people are paid large sums to do equally effectively in another arena.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill restricts its interest in DIRT free accounts to those held by persons claiming to be non-residents.  This is a failing and that is why I have tabled an amendment which I hope will get all-party support.  One must ask why the investigation into the operation of DIRT free bank accounts should be restricted only to those operated in the name of supposed non-residents. There are and have been other opportunities for the unscrupulous to operate DIRT free accounts. These include opportunities which were identified <Col N="863" /> by the internal audit of the Revenue Commissioners as long ago as 1988 and commented on by both the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts in 1992 and 1993.</P>
      <P>None of the concerns raised in the period 1988-92 have been addressed due to the failure by Government to make progress on the long promised fund-raising for charitable and other purposes Bill or the related trusts Bill.  It has been publicly confirmed that once a body has been granted tax exempt status, it is free to open an unlimited number of DIRT free bank accounts. Whether such accounts are used solely to lodge and disperse funds collected for charitable purposes is not adequately monitored.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not operate adequate monitoring or review procedures of tax exempt bodies.  In many cases, there has been no follow up by the charity section after tax exempt status has been granted.  In a significant number of cases, tax exempt bodies are known to have changed their objectives and structures subsequent to getting tax exempt status.  However, there was no follow up or intervention by any of the statutory bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>The legislative provision requiring tax exempt bodies to account for their fund-raising activities is acknowledged to be inadequate.  There is no statutory body with which tax exempt bodies can be registered and no way their exemption from tax law, including their responsibility to pay DIRT, can be made known to the public.  In the absence of such provisions and safeguards, obvious opportunities for direct fraud and malpractice have been identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is why I tabled my amendment which I hope will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions to the debate. The Bill is a considered and balanced response to the recommendations made in the first interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  In that report the committee recognised the need for an investigation to be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General, new powers for the Comptroller and Auditor General to pursue the investigation, the presentation of a report to Dáil Éireann setting out the facts as far as possible, an examination of the report by the Committee of Public Accounts using enhanced compellability powers and a report to the Dáil drawing conclusions and making recommendations. All these matters, and many of the other crucial elements requested by the committee, are reflected in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has worked hard to get these arrangements right.  We have covered a lot of ground in a short time.  I have been greatly assisted in framing this legislation by consultations with the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General and their legal advisers.  I want to put on <Col N="864" /> record my appreciation of the time and commitment they have given to this matter over recent weeks.</P>
    <P>This has not been an easy exercise.  The matters to be investigated are important.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent constitutional officer and the request that he would prepare a special report of this nature is breaking new ground.  I am aware that this legislation could be fine-tuned and I accept that the amendments proposed have this in mind.  However, I ask the House to take into account the pressing need to progress this Bill as quickly as possible, particularly in relation to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to address a few specific points raised in the debate.  I was a little surprised that Deputy Noonan criticised us for not bringing the Bill before the House last week and not having the draft resolution circulated to Members before today.  I have sympathy with that view.  My understanding was that the Committee of Public Accounts did not want more than a month to elapse before the investigation could begin. Deputy Jim Mitchell, who has been involved in discussions with me, my officials and the Attorney General, can tell him that these were taking place last week.  I assure the Deputy there was no unavoidable delay in preparing the Bill. Only 55 days in total have elapsed since the Dáil sought this legislation.  The framing of this complex Bill could not have been completed any earlier.</P>
    <P>As regards the resolution, I am sure the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts will confirm that as late as last Friday evening, officials of my Department were in consultation with him about the text which was then cleared by the Government yesterday.  There was no unavoidable delay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan, Deputy Jim Mitchell and Deputy McDowell raised questions about the implications of the role of independent auditors. My legal advice is that this arrangement is necessary to protect the investigations of the Comptroller and Auditor General from a constitutional challenge.  These arrangements are innovative.  The special provisions concerning the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General are germane to his functions set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.  However, giving him specific responsibility to look into the accounts of private individuals held by the financial institutions could raise doubts.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, if the Comptroller and Auditor General feels he needs information contained in such accounts, he may, at his discretion, appoint an independent auditor to examine them and report to him.  The auditor acts on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General and subject to his control and supervision which is, as section 2(1)(c) states, &ldquo;for the purpose of enabling the Comptroller to perform his functions under this Act&rdquo;.  It is difficult to see how this could act as a brake on the functions of the Comptroller and <Col N="865" /> Auditor General.  On the contrary, the purpose of the provision is to obviate the risk of potentially lengthy and disruptive court challenges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also asked me to comment on the nature of the absolute privilege provided for the chairman and members of the committee under section 11 of the Bill.  Such privilege attaches to members for the purpose of the performance of their functions as such members.  In this regard, the range of functions mentioned by Deputy Noonan would be encompassed within the scope of the privilege granted.  However, I am advised that comments made on television, radio or in the print media cannot be understood as being &ldquo;the performance of their functions as members&rdquo;.  Accordingly, they are not covered in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell says we have created &ldquo;a tribunal by another name&rdquo;.  I understand his concerns. In his closing remarks he outlined what was the role of the Oireachtas and the Committee and what should be the role of the Judiciary.  This is a problem which has addressed the minds of Members of this House for a long time and the last Government tried to address it too in the Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>
    <P>I am more in the Deputy McDowell camp on this matter than perhaps would be other Members of the House.  There must be a clear distinction between what is appropriate to the courts and what is appropriate to be investigated by the House.  I accept that it is difficult to draw lines appropriately.  In general, we must be careful not to turn the Oireachtas or sub-committees of the Oireachtas into alternative courts.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take Committee Stage now.</P>

He seemed to take offence that I had argued that the Bill should have been presented to the House in sufficient time to allow a proper Second Stage debate with an interval in the normal way so that we could consider amendments for Committee Stage.  That my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who is Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, was in consultation with the Minister's officials does not meet the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> Deputy Mitchell, as Chairman, has a role to play. We, as members of the Opposition, have a different role altogether in the House.  That we are from the same party and good colleagues is just a coincidence.  There is no point in the Minister or his officials pretending that we are following best practice by putting this through tonight without proper examination.  There is no point in getting offended about the criticisms we made earlier.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should not be offended.  An extraordinary number of man-hours have been put into this Bill by officials in my Department, the office of the Attorney General, legal advisers to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and me.  I would accept what Deputy Noonan says, that it is not satisfactory that in a few hours on the last day of this session we are trying to put through a complex Bill such as this.  However, it was the desire of everybody, none more so than the Committee of Public Accounts, that this Bill would be enacted before we rise at the end of this session and that it be signed into law by tomorrow evening in order that the resolution could be passed in the House on Thursday morning.  Certain other arrangements had to be made also to ensure that it would be signed into law tomorrow because I understand the President is not available tomorrow and the Commission must sit to sign this into law.</P>
      <P>It has been the desire of everybody to have it done as quickly as possible.  I accept the point of Deputy Noonan, that it is not satisfactory that we put through legislation such as this in this way but such are the exigencies of time.  Everybody wants it to be put into effect.</P>
      <P>Of all the legislation with which we have dealt in my time as Minister and in Opposition, this is as complex a Bill as we have ever attempted. Deputy McDowell might have put his finger on it when he stated that it was a hybrid Bill.  That is a fair summation of it.  It is trying to marry a number of competing principles which are complex and tied up in legal, constitutional, parliamentary and other issues.  It has not been easy.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I was reflecting the frustrations of some of my officials who have spent upwards of 18 hours per day and weekends trying to get this into its present form.</P>

Having said that, if there is established to be a constitutional infirmity in this Bill which we might reasonably have foreseen, we will look very silly indeed, more silly than is normally the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not satisfactorily or adequately answered the central point which only came to light today in respect of section 2(1)(c) whereby the Comptroller and Auditor General is not being enabled to do the investigation himself but must in all cases have it done on his behalf by an auditor.</P>

      <P>I spoke briefly on this on Second Stage.  It has been widely and publicly acknowledged that if a body which has been granted tax exempt status decides to operate marginally or substantially outside the terms of reference on which its special DIRT free status in tax law is based, there are inadequate controls in place.  I take the view that ultimately a comprehensive charities Act is required alongside the publication of a compendium of all bodies which have been granted that tax exempt status since the Income Tax Act, 1967. We have formally requested that from the Taoiseach. The Revenue Commissioners have told us that it is not available.  There are about 6,000 involved, not many of whom are in the public domain.  It is a matter of grave public concern and we have received a great deal of correspondence stating that this area has to be examined.  The Public Accounts Committee should be able to examine this issue in some detail.</P>
      <P>Section 358 refers to a charity's ability to go to the US to raise funds.  This area also needs to be examined.  It is scandalous that we have not had the transparency required.

However, the purpose of this Bill, as envisaged by the Dáil resolution of some months ago, is to investigate the controversy relating to the conflict of evidence, other matters arising at the Public Accounts Committee and the matters relating to DIRT.  It would hardly be germane to insert a section concerning the wide remit of charities.  That may be a matter for another day.  I am sure that Deputy Mitchell may consider Deputy Gormley's request on another day.  However, this is not the purpose of this Bill and I cannot agree to the amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to elucidate the exact position.  I tabled the amendment before I received a copy of the resolution this evening. The resolution has to be put before the House on Thursday.  Will the Minister clarify whether it is intended to allow for, or to oblige, the Clerk of the Dáil to effectively sit on the Comptroller's report for a fortnight while it is considered by the committee?  I am not sure that is the right way to proceed.  We could have a more meaningful debate if the Minister clarified if that is the intention. As currently formulated, the provisions of the Bill permit that to happen.</P>

I need to be sure that is the intention before we pursue a pointless debate.</P>

      <P>The committee sought that we would have an advance copy of the report.  That is the case in any analogous situation.  For example, if an inspector is appointed by the High Court under the Companies Act, the inspector goes to the High Court confidentially and the court decides what parts of the report are to be published and when.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is an authorised officer of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Companies Act, the authorised officer reports to the Minister who decides what is to be published and when.  In the case of value for money reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General &mdash; a role given to him under the 1993 Act &mdash; he liaises with the Department which has three months to lay it before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee wants some advance notice so <Col N="871" /> as not to be at a disadvantage or, at least, to have prepared its consideration of what it should do with the report before it appears in the media.  It thought it prudent to seek that provision, but it does not appear to be provided for.  It has been stated that the formulation in subsection (3) allows for that possibility.  However, that is not my reading of it and I regret it does not make such a provision.</P>

      <P>On the suggested operation of this subsection, the proposed subsection in section 2, I have some doubt as to the constitutional validity of this procedure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is responsible to the Dáil.  He is a high constitutional officer and the obligation on him under the Constitution is to report to the Dáil, not to the Clerk of the Dáil. Has the Minister sought the opinion of the Attorney General on this issue?  I would be concerned that we are changing that relationship in this subsection.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a duty to report to the Clerk of Dáil Éireann and there is some discussion as to the type of resolution that will be adopted by this House on foot of that subsection and on what we will direct the Clerk of the Dáil to do.  We are free by resolution to direct the Clerk to do various things.  However, it is not clear that we are free by enactment to tell the Comptroller and Auditor General to do something other than what he is directed to do by the Constitution, namely, to report to this House.  I am somewhat confused on this point and perhaps I could be assisted.  There is a point of substance in this sub-section in that the position of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that he now reports to the Clerk of the Dáil rather than to the Dáil itself. There is nothing to stop us passing a resolution telling the Clerk what to do.  My doubt is as to whether we can tell the Comptroller and Auditor General what to do in this subsection.</P>

      <P>While the Minister is reflecting on that point, which has come up in the discussions we have had, the answer to which I also look forward, let me explain the practical problems that the committee is facing and that it seeks to have resolved.  Most reasonable people would agree that it is important that the members of the committee should have sight of the report in time to give some measured and considered response before it gets into the public domain.  As I understand it, laying it before the House means effectively that it will simultaneously come into the public domain, and neither the chairman nor any member of the committee will have a greater opportunity than anyone else to consider the report.  Quite separate from the point Deputy Lenihan makes, it is a serious practical problem which, if the Minister were willing, could be met by a requirement that the Clerk of the Dáil should lay it before the House not later than seven days from its receipt, or something like <Col N="872" /> that.  That would give an opportunity to the committee to consider it.  Whether the Clerk may give sight of it to the members of the committee without it being expressly provided for in legislation is something I am not clear about.  It seems that he cannot do that, that he has to treat all Members of the House similarly.</P>

      <P>The point being raised by Deputy Brian Lenihan is germane, and it is something that was considered.  I did put the point to the Attorney General quite recently and I am advised that no constitutional difficulty arises. Deputy Lenihan is quite correct in saying that the provisions of the Constitution are very explicit in that they provide that the Comptroller and Auditor General reports to Dáil Éireann.  It does not say he has to report to anybody else.  The advice from the Attorney General is that no constitutional difficulty arises because the Clerk of Dáil Éireann will act as a conduit.  He is not asked to examine or read the report but just to pass it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution that we are going to pass on Thursday provides that the Clerk of Dáil Éireann should, as soon as is practicable after receipt by him of any such report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, lay it before Dáil Éireann.  So the resolution will cover that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the late Deputy John Kelly being asked about that in terms of the resignation of a Taoiseach in 1989, and he said that the Taoiseach ought to present his credentials to the President as fast as was consistent with not breaking the traffic lights.  How soon is &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo;&mdash; immediately?  It seems to have the same meaning as Deputy Noonan ascribes to it, which leaves the committee with the problem we are seeking to resolve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The clerk of the committee is bound by Standing Orders to circulate any document he receives as soon as he receives it.  He cannot withhold any document from the committee. I assume there is a similar obligation on the Clerk of Dáil Éireann in relation to the Members of Dáil Éireann.  The committee has considered <Col N="873" /> this in great detail.  It has been very careful about what is being sought.  We are merely seeking a few days advance notice so that we will have time to give some consideration to our next steps before the inevitable media frenzy on the publication of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the instant demands to know what we are going to do next.  All analogous situations allow for this.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Brian Lenihan's point on its constitutionality, this is giving additional functions to the Comptroller and Auditor General in the same way as the 1993 Act did.  Section 11 of the 1993 Act provides that the Comptroller and Auditor General shall first supply his report to the Department which gets three months in which to consider it.  I know a value-for-money report cannot be seen in the same light as a report of such importance as this, but nonetheless it is an analogous situation.  All we are looking for is that some practical way be found to give the committee a few days notice.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I am in the company of experienced politicians, and I am sure they do not mean this, but what they are suggesting would be a &ldquo;leaker's charter&rdquo;.  Does anybody seriously think that a group of politicians, experienced ones at that, would have a report that could be quite sensational in their possession for, say, three days and it would not be leaked to the media?  Why should people not have the right and have it at the same time as the Members of Dáil Éireann?  Having it laid before the Dáil means that it is laid publicly and everybody is on an equal footing.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy Mitchell, let me seek some clarification.  The word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo;, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has a constitutional position of independence. Is it implicit in this section that the Comptroller and Auditor General can decide whether or not to report, as he deems appropriate, to the committee, as Deputy Mitchell seems to be requesting?  Can he, as a matter of discretion, request that the report be furnished to members of the committee and then pretty much immediately, to all other Members of the House? It is important to get clarification on that.  I presume it is a legal drafting clarification that we are seeking, whether it will be at the discretion of the Comptroller and Auditor General to circulate a report to whomsoever and whenever he deems fit?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a misunder-standing about the meaning of lines 34, 35 and 36. These words provide that the Comptroller and Auditor General may, at his discretion, furnish a report to the clerk of the committee.  The purpose was to provide that there would be no impediment if the Comptroller and Auditor General wished to give an advance copy to the committee, as was sought in the interim report.  Deputy Joe <Col N="874" /> Higgins, by his intervention, summed up the dilemma of trying to get the right balance.  What this Bill is asking the Comptroller and Auditor General to do is a once-off measure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reports to Dáil Éireann, but this Bill, and the pursuant resolution that will be put through on Thursday, is a special hybrid, to use Deputy McDowell's description. The purpose of lines 34, 35 and 36 is to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General, at his discretion, to furnish a copy of the report to the clerk of the committee.  The clerk of the committee may give an advance copy to the committee if the Comptroller and Auditor General gives it to him in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is teased out, it does not address the situation.  What specifically do the Minister's notes say about the points raised by Deputy Mitchell?  If this were a tribunal of inquiry set up by this House, the tribunal would report to the Minister who sponsored the resolution in this House, and the Minister would have time, as happened in a very celebrated case that we know of, to formulate a response.  If it was an authorised officer under the Companies Acts, the Minister who appointed the authorised officer gets the report and there is time to consider it before it enters the public domain, if it does. Third, if one goes to the High Court and an inspector is appointed under the Companies Acts, the inspector reports to the Minister who has time to consider it.</P>
      <P>All that is being submitted here is that it is important, given the gravity of these issues, that the Chairman and members of the Committee have an opportunity to look at the report.  It is not the laying of it before this House which causes problems, it is the fact that there is simultaneous publication.  It may be said that it is at the Clerk's discretion.  However, the resolution we will take on Thursday morning is very specific and states &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo;, which means immediately. Our opinion is that the Comptroller and Auditor General would not be minded to give a copy to members of the Committee or even the Chairman in advance.  That has not been his practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take up all of Committee Stage on this amendment.  However, I wish to clarify the purpose of my amendment. This problem arises precisely because the Comptroller is a constitutional officer and because there is a constitutional obligation on the Comptroller to report to Dáil Éireann.  The various possibilities which apply to other bodies do not apply to the Comptroller.  We are grafting additional non-constitutional powers on to the Comptroller's role.  We have to assume the responsibility of the Comptroller to report to this House still applies, even to these additional powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment specifically requires the Clerk to report forthwith to Dáil Éireann.  The Minister <Col N="875" /> is right in saying the members of the Committee are taking a different view to those who are not on the Committee &mdash; perhaps that is in the natural course of things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell anticipated what I was going to say.  I take the practical point made by Deputies Rabbitte and Jim Mitchell. However, the legal point is that there is no analogy between a tribunal of inquiry or an inspector under the Companies Acts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I thank the Minister for his reply to my earlier query.  If the section is to enjoy a presumption of conformity with the Constitution, it has to be interpreted in a light that conforms with it.  One cannot oblige the Comptroller and Auditor General to report to a section of the House &mdash; his obligation is to report to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I find myself, strangely, in agreement with Deputy Higgins on this point.  News being what it is, it is inevitable this matter will emerge in any event.  I find it hard to see why the point is being pressed so much by the Committee, although I understand the practical point raised.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Governments, this one as much as previous ones, have an extraordinary obsession that when questions are raised relating to bank accounts, particularly those held by wealthy individuals, secrecy is always insisted upon.  I want to know why.  Where tax evasion has been found to be the reason for accounts being structured in such a way, why should secrecy be enshrined in law to protect those people?</P>
      <P>The Government went to extraordinary lengths to prevent the establishment of facilities for the investigation on the Ansbacher accounts and the publication of the names of those involved.  The chairman of the tribunal said accounts were established for not very honourable purposes, to put it mildly.  We have had the extraordinary situation of Allied Irish Banks where in one town &mdash; Tralee, I believe &mdash; about 14,000 accounts were bogus offshore accounts.  Irish residents conspired with the bank to most likely evade taxes, using false identities.  Why does the Minister say these people should not be named once it has been established by the Comptroller and Auditor General?</P>
      <P>Similarly if accounts are found in the course of an investigation to be the result of criminal activity or the proceeds of heroin dealing or other nefarious activities, why should they not be named?  An unfortunate heroin addict was sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing a handbag. She was named in every newspaper in the land and on radio and television.  Her sentence was reduced to six years on appeal and she was named again.  She was vulnerable, defenceless and in trouble.  Why should the rich be protected in this way?</P>

However, if it is established that an <Col N="877" /> account has been opened for the purposes of evading tax or to hold the proceeds of criminal activity, I do not see why it ought to be maintained as a secret.  As I understand it, under later sections of the Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General can pass this information on to the Revenue Commissioners.  As a result, can I presume the Revenue Commissioners, in its report for that year will publish the names?</P>

      <P>As regards the points made by Deputy Higgins, my knowledge of Kerry people is confined mainly to footballers.  Coming from County Kerry, he would know why there were 14,000 such accounts in that branch in Tralee.  He probably knows the vagaries of Kerry people better than I do.  I bow to his superior knowledge on that matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding secrecy and people being secretive about their bank accounts, I read in one of today's newspapers about a survey done by the Data Protection Commissioner which found that people were more secretive about their financial affairs and records than about their health records.  This may be a uniquely Irish phenomenon, but is not confined to people who have loads of money stacked away in bank accounts of which the Revenue Commissioners are unaware. People are secretive about their financial affairs even if they have no money and have a big liability to the banks, as most people have.</P>
      <P>I have covered the substance of Deputy Higgins's amendment in amendment No. 5 in my name.  This also answers the point raised by Deputy Rabbitte.  Amendment No. 5 deletes the words &ldquo;an auditor appointed under subsection (1)&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;by an auditor appointed under subsection (1) (otherwise than for the purposes of subsection (7))&rdquo;.  Subsection (7) says &ldquo;the Comptroller may furnish to the Revenue Commissioners.  .. particulars of the persons concerned, including their names, addresses and occupations, trades or professions&rdquo;.  The reason I inserted amendment No. 5 was to ensure there is no ambiguity and that the provisions in subsection (7) could not be frustrated, something the alternative form of words achieves.  My advice was that there was no need for amendment No. 5 and that subsection (7) was correct.</P>
      <P>There is no need for Deputy Higgins's amendment. The only difference in substance between amendments Nos. 5 and 6 is that my amendment does not refer to criminal activity.  However, criminal activity would be picked up if detected by the banks or the Comptroller and Auditor General and is a totally separate matter.  I have dealt with the question raised by Deputy Higgins in amendment No. 6 through amendment No. 5.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 9, lines 14 to 20, to delete subsection (8).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a probing amendment.  It seeks to delete section 2(8) which confers absolute privilege on the utterances of the auditor and any employee or agent of the auditor or any document or report <Col N="879" /> produced by the auditor.  I wonder whether it is necessary to confer absolute privilege on any report produced by the auditor.  Absolute privilege is an extraordinary privilege and allows one to say anything about anybody and not be called to account, whether there is malice involved or not and whether one is completely negligent in the discharge of one's duties or not.  Clearly, if the auditors discharge their duty with due diligence and set out facts which they believe in good faith to be true, without malice, then it is right that such material be privileged and that they should not be called to account for it.  However, I am not convinced it is necessary to go a step further and confer on the auditors or the Comptroller and Auditor General absolute privilege which is impregnable.  My understanding is that the Comptroller and Auditor General in the discharge of his normal duties does not enjoy absolute privilege &mdash; perhaps the Minister will clarify this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section gives privilege to utterances or reports of an auditor appointed under section 2(1).  This is necessary to enable the auditor to operate without fear of litigation in the course of an investigation.  I have some sympathy with the point made by Deputy McDowell but can see no way out of it other than to give absolute privilege to the auditor and to assume the auditors will be professionally qualified and will act ethically.  I often see barristers and solicitors in court making allegations and proceeding in a way I think is very poor.  However, on balance the system works pretty well.  I cannot see how I can remove this provision.  I have some sympathy for Deputy McDowell's point of view and I see the point he is making about the committee or the Comptroller and Auditor General going too far.  However, I cannot see how I can do other than give the auditor absolute privilege in the performance of his duties.  We will have to assume the professional auditor appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General will act ethically. I think this is a reasonable assumption.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most significant section in the Bill.  It will not worry us much if we do not discuss other sections as they are borrowed from other legislation.  It is the most extraordinary section I have ever seen.  It starts off by giving powers to the House, by way of resolution, to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate matters where there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of substantial risk to the revenues of the State and it is couched in general terms.  It goes <Col N="880" /> on, in effect, to make this a once-off provision in respect of the DIRT scandal.  One would have thought at that stage that the resolution could have been incorporated here rather than going through this mechanism of having an empowering section which will be triggered by a resolution of the House.  It looks as if it started off in one direction at the conception level but got pulled back.</P>
      <P>The other area which is extraordinary is that the Comptroller and Audit General and his staff will not carry out the investigation and examination of documents in the financial institutions. He and his staff have all the skills but the mechanism here means that an auditor will be sent in. The only justification the Minister gave on Second Stage for sending in an auditor was that some type of legal buffer can be established so that the Comptroller and Auditor General will operate at a remove because there seems to be legal advice that there will be a challenge and that this would be a defence in such an event.  That is what the Minister said on Second Stage, that is, that an auditor will be sent in to provide a defence in the event of a court challenge.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary legislation.  I have never seen anything like section 2, and I have been here for a long time.  I wonder what is going on, it is couched in such absolute terms, and that arises from something Deputy Joe Higgins said about secrecy.  The activities of the auditor under this section are so ringfenced from the man who appoints him, the Comptroller and Auditor General, that it reaches the point of absurdity where the Comptroller and Auditor General could be inhibited from carrying out the functions ascribed to him by Dáil Éireann under section 2(1) because of the way the powers of the auditor are ringfenced from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>If an amendment was accepted at the end of the section and words such as &ldquo;for the purpose of this paragraph the auditor shall produce to the Comptroller such supporting documents as the Comptroller requires&rdquo;, at least we would be providing a loop back from the auditor to the Comptroller.  It seems the Comptroller will appoint the auditor who will be statute barred from providing documents to the Comptroller and Auditor General even if he believes he needs them.  There must be a type of loop back if we are to go this way.  I find the way section 2 is constructed an extraordinary mechanism.  I fear it will not work in practice.</P>

      <P>The main reason for this Bill is to examine Revenue, the banks and the procedures adopted by Revenue in relation to banks and the way they calculated interest on DIRT.  That individuals are involved is secondary in this case as regards the requirements of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This also is a protection to the banking system.  This investigation is about how Revenue proceeded with the various banking institutions in relation to DIRT.  It does not relate to individual taxpayers' problems.  Section 2 effectively <Col N="881" /> means that if something comes to light, it will be fully reported to the Revenue Commissioners together with the particulars of the item involved along with the names and addresses of those involved.</P>

My understanding at all stages was that the Comptroller and Auditor General would have direct access to all the general files of the institutions but that when it came to individual accounts, he had discretion and that if he felt access was necessary, he would go through an auditor.  It has now been presented that as the Bill is drafted, that is not the case and that in practice, the Comptroller and Auditor General will have to get all reports on financial institutions from the auditor.  He will not be able to access reports such as the auditors reports, the board minutes or any such general documents.  Will the Minister clarify that?  Will he accept an amendment along the lines indicated by Deputy Noonan?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mitchell and other Deputies raised this point on Second Stage.  The Deputy suggested section 2(1)(c) prevents the Comptroller and Auditor General from looking at any papers in the banks because they might refer to individual accounts.  Our legal advice is <Col N="882" /> that this does not preclude it as references to individuals can be blocked out.  The possibility that he might stumble on them is not a barrier to him looking at audit reports, etc.  Our legal advice is that Deputy Mitchell's amendment is too wide and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>A Deputy raised the point that the auditor would be working independently of everyone else.  Section 2(1)(c) states:</P>
      <P>if the Comptroller considers it necessary to do so for the purpose of the performance of his or her functions under this Act, appoint an auditor to carry out on his or her behalf and subject to his or her control and supervision and upon and subject to such other terms and conditions (if any) as the Comptroller may determine or the High Court may specify.</P>
      <P>I highlighted this fact this evening.  The auditor will work under the control and supervision of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
      <P>The fundamental point is that the purpose of this legislation is not for the Comptroller and Auditor General or the auditor on his behalf to go about assessing the tax liability of those people whom Deputy Joe Higgins may want him to assess.  Deputy Jim Mitchell has made that quite clear on a number of occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Member is aware of the growing use of non-conventional methods of medicine in society.  The growth in use of acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine in Ireland in the past ten to 15 years has been astonishing. While we all recognise the existence of alternative forms of medicine, the State has flatly refused to recognise the phenomena and to implement standards for professionals working in the area.  The Minister for Health and Children should establish a national register of practitioners so that the public and professionals are aware of their rights and responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Under current law, any member of the public is entitled to establish as a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine without qualifications.  I understand there are currently 200 trained practitioners of acupuncture and Chinese medicine in Ireland, the majority of whom are self-regulated, carry insurance cover and are governed by a voluntary code of conduct.  While there is no doubt about the commitment and professionalism of these people, there is widespread concern within the profession about the absence of agreed national standards in training and qualifications. Any member of the public can legitimately establish a training course in alternative medicine or establish a practice.  This cannot be allowed to continue and the Department of Health and Children has a direct responsibility to introduce national standards for the training of people in acupuncture and Chinese medicine.  I cannot think of another profession in which this would be allowed.</P>
      <P>Non-conventional medicine is here to stay and it is self-evident that increasing numbers of people will turn to acupuncture or other forms of traditional Chinese medicine to seek medical cures.  I understand it is now 20 years since the World Health Organisation drew up a list of diseases it considered responsive to acupuncture treatment.  The majority of western countries have established official bodies for the regulation and recognition of Chinese medicine.  In Britain, acupuncture is available on the National Health Service, and many private health insurance providers reimburse clients for acupuncture and Chinese medical services.  It is wrong that people are charged VAT when they obtain acupuncture therapy.  Taxing people as they attempt to alleviate their pain and suffering through non-conventional medicine does not seem equitable or just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most worrying aspect of the debate is that the State has implicitly and explicitly failed to recognise the existence of non-conventional medicine.  This is against a background of international research which shows the positive effects of such medicine.  Given the number of people involved in the area, it seems ridiculous to ignore it.  I am aware of many medical practitioners who <Col N="884" /> view acupuncture and Chinese medicine as complementary to the work of their profession. Patients should have a right to the broadest type of therapy but, more importantly, they have a right to be protected in law by standards and regulations governing the performance of alternative medicine.  This issue cannot be dodged any longer and the Government has a responsibility to respond to the many voices calling for a register and a code of practice in the area.  Ignoring the existence of non-conventional medicine will simply allow a rogue element to fester and grow within the profession.  Recognising the existence of acupuncture and Chinese medicine would greatly assist in establishing long-term confidence in this growing area of medicine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas of acupuncture and Chinese medicine can be included under the umbrella title of complementary or alternative medicine.  The position of such medicine in Ireland is that it is not regulated by statute, and there are no proposals at present to do so.</P>
      <P>I recognise it is desirable to afford some protection to the public who wish to use such medicines. The legal position of practitioners of complementary or alternative medicines is that their dealings with clients are regulated by civil law.  Regarding control of standards and codes of practice in the area, my Department's policy has been to encourage the various therapies to establish their own regulatory structures and to develop mechanisms to inform the general public about the availability of services from reputable therapists.  Many of the therapies have adopted this system of self-regulation. Officials of my Department meet representatives of various alternative medicine practitioners, the last such meeting took place in May 1998.  Practitioners of complementary medicines are free to provide services to the public as long as they do not represent themselves as being registered medical practitioners.  Practitioners of such treatments are not employed within the public health services and regulation to date has been introduced only in areas where employment has been within the public health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware proposals are before the European Commission at present to consider conducting a research study into the area of complementary or alternative medicines.  Any such study will undoubtedly investigate the subjects of safety, effectiveness and area of application.  It is anticipated that, on completion, the research project will result in state registration of some type in each member state.  The question of such registration would pose many problems in that the nature of the services undertaken by complementary or alternative medicine practitioners is not easily defined and ranges from chiropractice to acupuncture to homeopathy to even herbal remedies. It would be difficult to devise a practical system of registration that would encompass such a maze of unrelated activities.  For example, it is suggested that there are at least 30 main branches <Col N="885" /> of alternative therapies in the UK.  With the exception of those who are already qualified doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, etc., many practitioners in this area would hold non-standard qualifications from unrecognised bodies which do not enjoy external validation or chartered status. The matter is further complicated by the fact that many of the complementary or alternative therapies are riven by factional disputes, which have produced rival groupings within a therapy, each one opposed to the training and methodologies of the other.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at present to regulate standards of practice and training for alternative or complementary medicine, including acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of grave concern to thousands of women.  The emotional and physical trauma that lies behind this issue is heart-breaking. I have no intention of making a political point from the revelations of recent days. However, the revelations regarding the number of caesarean hysterectomies carried out by a certain obstetrician needs a political response.</P>
      <P>It is important that people, and especially women, see that the Minister for Health and Children, his Department, the health board concerned and this House are treating the matter with the urgency and the sensitivity it requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that the matter is in the public domain I ask the Minister for Health and Children to inform the House when the matter first came to his attention and the precise action he has taken since then?  In regard to the review group established to examine these cases, will the Minister answer the following questions.  Is he satisfied with the adequacy of the review group, its composition and its terms of reference?  What is the legal standing of the review group?  Why is the review group examining only nine of the 27 cases?  Are there not serious questions to ask about the other 18 operations?  Have all 27 people who had a caesarean hysterectomy been contacted by the Department or by the hospital or has the number been limited to those identified in the report produced by Dr. Maresh?  There are question marks over the numbers.  From media reports we have been led to believe there were 27 such operations in this hospital but tonight on <i>Prime Time</i> I note that the figure of 40 was mentioned.  What is the exact number of people involved?  What procedures has the Minister put in place for the health board to keep them informed of developments on this matter?  What is the proposed timescale for the review and will the Minister undertake to publish its findings?  A number of other issues need to be clarified at an early date. Were the women who had the caesarean hysterectomies contacted before the story reached the national newspapers or did they learn about this controversy through the media?  Were the women and their families informed an outside review of <Col N="886" /> their cases was being carried out by a professor from Manchester University?</P>
    <P>It is important to receive answers to all these questions.  At all times during the course of this controversy we must ensure the women and their families are fully informed of developments as events unfold.  Has a counselling and support service been established for women who had a caesarean hysterectomy who were treated by this obstetrician?  The consequences of this operation stay with the family and a mother for the rest of their lives.  Given the circumstances that have recently emerged, it is vital that these women receive every support available.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to one other specific point. Doubts about the number of operations carried out by this obstetrician were first raised by midwives in the hospital concerned.  However it has emerged that even a cursory examination of case statistics would have shown the incredible increase in the number of caesarean hysterectomies carried out by this obstetrician in this hospital. Between 1994-5 an average of one operation per year was performed.  However, between 1996-8 an average of nine of these operations were performed in the hospital each year.  It is incredible that a major increase in this type of procedure seemingly went unnoticed and did not provoke a review by the hospital management.</P>
    <P>In light of this, has the Minister given serious consideration to instituting a clinical audit system which would bring a degree of transparency and accountability to the work of senior consultants and surgeons?  Surely it is important that a monitoring system be put in place that could have picked up on a significant increase, such as occurred in this hospital.  Otherwise we seem to rely on the courage and determination of other staff to raise questions about a colleague's performance. The weakness of this system is obvious and could have devastating results for patients.</P>
    <P>We may be confronting an appalling health care controversy here.  It is important the Minister, his Department and the health board concerned ensure that patient care and the welfare of the women at the centre of this controversy are paramount at all times.  That is why I sought this adjournment debate and I urge the Minister to ensure this principle informs his actions and those of the health board in the coming weeks and months.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The matter raised by the Deputy is an important and sensitive one which must be handled very carefully by all concerned.  I do not wish to comment on the case, which is under independent investigation by an expert group nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on the initiative of the chief executive officer of the local health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All cases involving individual consultants are a matter for the relevant employer &mdash; in this case a health board &mdash; and it would not be appropriate <Col N="887" /> for the Minister, or the Department to become involved in an ongoing investigation of this nature. The health board involved in this case notified the Department immediately when the issue came to light and the Minister has been kept fully informed of developments since then.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware the matter arises from concerns raised by health board management regarding the clinical practices of an individual consultant obstetrician.  The chief executive officer of the health board concerned took immediate steps to deal with the situation as soon as he became aware of it.  The board has now initiated a review which is being carried out by three experts nominated by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  At the board's request, the consultant has taken administrative leave while the review proceeds.</P>
    <P>It would be inappropriate for me to comment on any aspect of the investigation or on any other aspect of these matters.  I am satisfied the health board concerned has taken all necessary and reasonable steps to deal with this and they will continue to keep the Minister informed of developments.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the health board has arranged for a small number of patients of the consultant in question to be contacted through their general practitioner.  The board has also established a help line for anyone who is worried about this matter.  There is access to a social worker and to a psychologist for those who have any reason to be concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything that would prejudice the review now proceeding.  The report of the expert review group will be completed in due course and the health board will take whatever steps are appropriate at that time.  The health board has acted quickly and the Minister is satisfied it will continue to deal with the matter with the best interests of patients and their families in mind, having due regard to the rights of the consultant concerned.</P>

      <P>A tragic accident took place in the Ballyphehane area of Cork city, early on Sunday morning last, in which the mother of three children was hit by a stolen car driven in a dangerous and reckless fashion.  After a night out in the city, a couple were walking home crossing the road, when a car struck Mrs. June Atkins and dragged her 200 yards.  She died as a result of the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appalling crime has left a deep sense of <Col N="888" /> sympathy but also anger in the community at the horrific consequences of this high speed driving addiction which has caused so much death and destruction on our streets.  There was much anger in Ballyphehane in Cork city and in the community at large after the initial shock of the tragedy.  There was anger as the facts began to emerge regarding the perpetrators of this crime.</P>
    <P>It appears the person involved in this incident has had a previous history of such a crime.  Is this true?  He had been in prison for jumping bail and was on temporary release for the past three weeks.  How would someone with such a history qualify for temporary release?  There are many questions being asked on the streets of Cork about the revolving door system in our prisons. This is a senseless system whereby an individual can be imprisoned for a crime by the courts and can be out on the streets in a short time, free to carry out his reckless hobby of dangerous driving, leading to possible fatal injury.</P>
    <P>When will the State get tough on those who commit this appalling crime?  Joyriding does not merely involve stealing, it is a murderous crime. The full rigours of the law must be used to protect innocent people on our streets and criminals from themselves.  How many more deaths will occur as a result of &ldquo;deathriding&rdquo; before the Minister acknowledges the need to act on the issue?  He must address the fact that this crime does not merely involve the theft of cars, it can and will lead to death.  Anyone stealing a car and driving in such a dangerous fashion should be charged with manslaughter if they kill someone, nothing less will keep our streets safe.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that three of the five stolen car fatalities in Cork this year involved offenders on early or temporary release or convicted car thieves?  This horrific hobby of &ldquo;deathriding&rdquo; is addictive, but a person who apparently has a less than satisfactory relationship with our prison regime was considered suitable for temporary release.  Was this a so-called Christmas release?  If so, why did it come so early?  Why do others in the State begin their Christmas holidays on 23 December while criminals of this sort are given long holidays to inflict terror and tragedy on the community?  What will the members of the Atkins family, who tomorrow bury their wife and mother, do for Christmas?</P>
    <P>Did the Minister not consider it was highly likely the individual who committed this crime would carry out his &ldquo;deathriding&rdquo; hobby while on temporary release from prison?  As far as I am aware there are no programmes in Cork prison to confront convicted joyriders with the reality and dangers of their lethal habit.  Many would argue that prison affords these young men an opportunity to boast and brag about their feats behind the wheels of stolen cars.  Prison and our system of early release do not appear to be a deterrent to these &ldquo;deathriders&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In Cork yesterday, a Garda inspector confirmed that the incidence of car theft there is again on the increase.  He appealed to the courts <Col N="889" /> to help to stamp out this problem by imposing stiff sentences.  Is the Minister listening to the Garda Síochána and will he respond to its calls for assistance with the problem of &ldquo;deathriding&rdquo; which has claimed five lives this year in Cork.  It must be frustrating for gardaí to see persistent offenders convicted, sentenced, imprisoned and then returned to the community on early release. Why was the individual in question, who has jumped bail, considered for early release and granted same?  What does the Minister intend to do to tackle this lethal crime which is ravaging our streets?</P>

      <P>I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for permitting me to contribute and I thank Deputy Clune for sharing time.  My sympathy goes to the Atkins family on the tragic loss of a wife and mother at the weekend.  I know the family well and two of Mrs. Atkins's nieces worked with me during the 1997 election campaign.</P>
      <P>Another innocent person has been mown down by a reckless driver.  On 17 March 1997 two innocent young men, Trevor O'Connell and Stephen Kirby, tragically lost their lives as a result of a joyriding incident.  However, the person who is alleged to have carried out this crime has still not gone to trial because he has frustrated the legal system for the past 18 months.  We must reconsider and review our policy on early releases.  Sentences must be served, stiffer sentences imposed and, if necessary, the law must be changed and strengthened.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I extend my deepest sympathy to Mr. Atkins and his family on their tragic loss.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that Mrs. June Atkins sustained fatal injuries in a traffic accident involving a stolen vehicle on Sunday last, 13 December 1998, at the junction of Pearse Road, Pouladuff Road, Ballyphehane, Cork.  I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that a suspect was arrested and detained under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  The House will appreciate that I am precluded from commenting further on this accident as the Garda is preparing a file for submission to the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The offence commonly referred to as &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; is a criminal offence under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended, which prohibits the taking of a vehicle without the owner's consent.  The problem of joyriding is not a new one and has diminished significantly from the high figures of the 1980's when Deputies will recall it reached its peak.  There has been a steady decrease in the number of vehicles stolen &mdash; in 1997, a total of 13,500 vehicles were stolen as against a total of 21,000 in 1980.  However, notwithstanding the overall picture, there appeared <Col N="890" /> to be an increase in this activity last year in the Cork area.  I assure the House that the Garda is pursuing a policy to curtail this activity.</P>
    <P>This policy includes the following enforcement initiatives.  The stinger vehicle stopping device has been used three times in Cork city since its introduction in 1997.  There are 17 such devices assigned to the various Cork divisions.  However, this device is used only when it is safe to do so. Stinger is a vehicle stopping device which is placed across the road which punctures the tyres of the vehicle with spikes in a controlled manner. The device is kept in a special case in the boot of a patrol car.  The Garda Síochána has 172 stinger vehicle stopping devices and they have been issued to selected stations throughout all divisions and specialised units.  Higher visibility patrols using four wheel drive vehicles and regular check-points have been put in place.  The Garda air support unit has also been used successfully on a number of occasions in dealing with stolen car offences.  The Garda also has power under section 41 of the Road Traffic Acts, 1994, to stop and detain vehicles driven by under-age drivers.</P>
    <P>In addition to these measures, the Garda is working closely with local communities in youth diversion programmes.  I support and fund these programmes which are community-based with the support of the Garda Síochána, which are designed to divert young people away from crime, including joyriding.  These 14 such schemes are in existence throughout the country.  Three are in the Cork area, where there is also the Cork auto diversion project which comes under the auspices of my Department.  These programmes are predominantly aimed at young people and involve various activities, sporting or otherwise, counselling, informal group work, education, group family and after-care support programmes, antivandalism pro-environment programmes and other activities appropriate in each of the specific catchment areas.</P>
    <P>The aim of these programmes is to prevent crime, to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal or anti-social activity, to improve the quality of life of young people, to provide activities aimed at improving life and communicating skills and personal development and to promote Garda-community relations. These programmes are managed by members of the Garda Síochána, the probation and welfare service and various voluntary and statutory groups.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Garda Síochána community relations section runs ongoing schools programmes throughout the country.  The objective of these programmes is to make young people aware of the danger of involving themselves in crime generally.  The Garda liaises with local authorities with a view to introducing more traffic calming measures in trouble spots.  The Garda authorities keep the situation with regard to unauthorised taking of vehicles under review and are ready to introduce any measure which will combat this activity, including the purchase of <Col N="891" /> necessary equipment and reviewing policing on the ground.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána will continue to work closely with local communities, local authorities and State services to deter young people from getting involved in this activity.  I have asked the Garda authorities to maximise their efforts to deal with this problem.  I have also requested them to report to me specifically in respect of the incidence of this activity in the Cork area.  I have asked them to identify any additional measures needed to tackle and curtail this problem in Cork. The House may be assured that I will support and finance any necessary measures which the Garda suggests should be taken.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of temporary release, this is a feature of prison systems internationally and has been operated under statute in this country since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  Prisoners are granted temporary release for a variety of reasons ranging from a few hours, for example, to visit a seriously ill relative, early release which may be renewed weekly or full temporary release in the last weeks of their sentences.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>All temporary releases are subject to certain conditions and, in most cases, the prisoner must report on a daily basis to a local Garda station.  In a substantial number of cases the granting of temporary releases may be affected by pressure on prison accommodation, in other words, prisoners may be released earlier than planned due to overcrowding.  This has been the case for several years.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions when in Opposition &mdash; I accept that this does not relate specifically to this case &mdash; I stated that the problems surrounding temporary releases had to be resolved.  That is why on taking office I approved the largest increase in the number of prison spaces in the history of the State.  Although I have been criticised by politicians and others, this is the correct stance.  The provision of additional prison spaces is of crucial importance to the proper administration of the criminal justice system.  Even if adequate accommodation was available, prisoners have to be prepared for release and in many instances temporary release is an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of factors are taken into account when granting temporary release.  These include <Col N="892" /> the nature of the offence committed, the length of the sentence imposed and served to date, compassionate grounds which might warrant special consideration, the behaviour of the prisoner in custody and the need to protect the community.</P>
    <P>I have done my level best and made strenuous efforts to reduce the number of offenders on temporary release.  Since taking office 70 spaces have been provided in Limerick Prison and 152 at the new prison in Castlerea.  The prison building programme is on target to make available 995 additional prison places by the end of 1999.  These will help to eliminate the problem of overcrowding and thereby tackle the need to grant related temporary release.  The number of offenders on temporary release taken as a proportion of the total number serving sentences has dropped significantly from 19 per cent in early December 1997 to 13 per cent at the start of this month.</P>

      <P>It is my firm intention to oversee continuation of this trend as the Government's ambitious prison building programme progresses. In general terms, not in relation to the specific case, for as long as prisoners are released on the criterion that there is a shortage of space, confidence in the criminal justice system will be undermined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms Fitzgerald Ms Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been reported in the media in recent days that an urgent Garda warning has been issued to parents on attempted child abductions, primarily in the Dublin area.  This raises the most serious questions.  Will the Minister outline the scale of the problem?  How many reports have the Garda Síochána received of attempted abductions of children in the Dublin area?  How many have there been outside it? Where have they happened?  Has there been a dramatic increase in recent weeks as reported and, if so, what is the explanation for it?  What progress has been made by the Garda Síochána in investigating these attempted abductions and has anybody been charged?</P>
      <P>These warnings strike terror into the heart of every parent.  While it is important not to raise undue alarm, the fact that the Garda Síochána has seen fit to issue a warning is alarming in itself. It has the most serious implications for children. What advice is there for parents and have schools been approached and given information?  We all want our children to enjoy the freedom to travel to and from school, to play with their friends and to take part in recreational activities without undue fear.  If there is a serious escalation in attempted abductions, extra precautions will have to be taken by all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is, as reported, the lack of a register of known child sex offenders impacting on the situation? <Col N="893" /> One newspaper went so far as to report that paedophiles from other countries were settling here to prey on Irish children.  Is there evidence of paedophile rings operating in Dublin or other parts of the country?  The Minister should make a clear and comprehensive statement on this serious issue so that all concerned can deal with it in the best possible way and take whatever steps are necessary to protect children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of reports have recently been made to the Garda Síochána concerning approaches to children while out alone, either playing or on their way home from school.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are taking each of these reports seriously and that each of the incidents is being thoroughly investigated.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of speculation in the media concerning the reports, I understand the Garda investigations are at too early a stage for concrete conclusions to be drawn as to the identity of the persons responsible.  Nothing should be said or done at this early stage which may have the effect of prejudicing the outcome of an ongoing Garda inquiry.</P>
      <P>On 11 December the Garda press office issued a press release on these incidents.  It reminded parents that with the long dark evenings and the approach of the school holidays they should talk to their children about personal safety.  Parents should know the whereabouts of their children at all times and try to avoid putting their children in a position where they have to wait alone outside school for collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána also recommends that children should be reminded about their personal safety and told not to approach strangers in cars while travelling to and from school or while out playing; not to play alone or become isolated <Col N="894" /> from other friends; to wear bright reflective clothing during the hours of darkness, and not to take sweets, lifts or talk to strangers without their parents' consent.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has developed a range of programmes dealing with aspects of social and personal safety which are part of the ordinary curriculum in primary and post-primary schools.  One such programme is the Stay Safe programme which is taught in a number of primary schools.  Every community should keep an eye on its children's safety and neighbourhood schemes such as neighbourhood watch and community alert could play an important role in the sightings of persons acting suspiciously.</P>
    <P>In the case of serious assaults of a sexual nature against children I published a discussion paper earlier this year on the law of sexual offences which includes a chapter on the sexual abuse of children.  I am considering submissions on this document.  This is an issue which the Government treats most seriously.  It is my intention to introduce a set of comprehensive criminal law reform proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>I have indicated my intention to establish a register of sex offenders to complement the existing recording arrangements in place by the Garda Síochána.  I have received a considerable number of submissions as to what the nature of this register should be.  For example, some would favour a register containing details of all sex offenders while others believe that it should be confined to details of those convicted of paedophile type offences.  I will carefully consider all the options in this respect before coming to a decision on the final shape of the register.  In the meantime reports of attempted abductions are taken seriously by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 December 1998.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to maintaining an effective official development assistance (ODA) policy and programme.  That commitment has been backed up by the largest-ever budgetary allocations for ODA.  Budgetary growth has in turn facilitated effective policy development and programme planning.</P>
      <P>The factual situation is that ODA has grown from £40 million (0.16 per cent of GNP) in 1992 to an estimated £137 million this year.  The allocation for the present year, when originally made, was expected to be equivalent to 0.32 per cent of GNP. Because of exceptional GNP growth in the interim, however, the outcome is now expected to be 0.29 per cent in GNP terms.  In financial terms, of course, the level of expenditure will nevertheless be significantly greater than ever before.</P>
      <P>The expansionary trend is set to continue in 1999.  The total allocation for 1999 is expected to amount to £153 million &mdash; an 11 per cent increase over the level for this year.  This is expected to be equivalent to 0.31 per cent of GNP, even allowing for continuing strong growth of GNP.</P>
      <P>In my view, these figures indicate significant progress in a short number of years.  At the same time, I recognise that much remains to be done in terms of making further progress towards our interim target of 0.45 per cent and the ultimate United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as ODA.</P>
      <P>A valuable recent innovation is the adoption, in addition to the GNP targets, of specific commitments to guaranteed minimum amounts for three years in advance for certain core elements of the programme, including emergency humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation assistance, co-financing of projects implemented by non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), bilateral aid of priority countries, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas and voluntary contributions to UN agencies.  On this basis, there is a guarantee of substantial additional resources for the programmes concerned over the period to 2001, thereby facilitating more effective planning of aid activities.  These elements of the budget will be increased by 66 per cent or £62.2 million over the next three years, amounting to a total of £400 million.  This is an important and worthwhile development as the programmes concerned have been particularly prone to budgetary uncertainty in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the details of the expenditure plans for 1999 and subsequent years have not yet been fully <Col N="896" /> worked out, I am confident that there will be steady growth in both financial and GNP terms. By 2001, we will be significantly closer to our GNP targets than we are at present.  Within that overall expansion, there will have been particularly strong growth in the core elements of the programme.</P>
    <P>In relation to the budgetary provisions for 1999 in particular, I am satisfied that the final Book of Estimates, when published, will show that all elements of the programme, including the provision for emergency humanitarian assistance, will be adequately funded.</P>
    <P>Against that background, there can be no question about the strength of the Government's commitment to ODA.  The House can be assured that the position in relation to ODA will continue to be positive for so long as the present Government is in office.  That is something that we take as given.  We do not contemplate any weakening of that position.</P>
    <P>Those of us with ministerial responsibilities in relation to ODA face an exciting and challenging time in terms of policy and programme development in the context of the commitment to continuing budgetary expansion.  We look forward with enthusiasm to confronting that challenge in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware the resolution, Towards a Nuclear Weapon Free World: The Need for a New Agenda, was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on Friday, 4 December with 114 votes in favour, 38 abstentions and 18 negative votes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution was the first step in the follow up process to the Nuclear Disarmament Declaration of the same name which I launched on 9 June last year in Dublin as a joint initiative with my colleagues, the Foreign Ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa and Sweden.  I indicated at that time that it was my intention to table a resolution jointly with these same countries at the General Assembly. <Col N="897" /> I met with my seven ministerial colleagues in New York in September to finalise the preparations for the tabling of the draft resolution.</P>
    <P>The positive reaction of the international community expressed at the General Assembly confirms that the June declaration was a timely call for the re-invigoration of the nuclear disarmament agenda.  The need for such an initiative was, as I have already informed the House on an earlier occasion, the failure of the international community, the nuclear weapon states in particular, to take advantage of the possibilities provided by the end of the Cold War to eliminate nuclear weapons for once and for all.</P>
    <P>There can be no excuse for the retention of these horrific weapons.  It cannot be excluded even after the Cold War that nuclear weapons, if retained in perpetuity, will be used either intentionally or by accident.  The detonation of even one nuclear weapon would unleash the destruction of a thousand Chernobyls.  The consequences of a larger nuclear exchange of even some of the more than 12,000 deployed weapons currently deployed does not bear thinking.</P>
    <P>The first step in our initiative has been to call upon all states, in particular the nuclear weapon states, to act now with a view to the speedy eradication of their weapons.  We are at a unique moment in history when co-operation between the nuclear weapon states provides an opening for such decisive action.  Were we to miss this window of opportunity, successive generations would not forgive us.</P>
    <P>In moving this initiative, I am deeply conscious of the international respect for Ireland and its role in the field of nuclear non-proliferation.  I recall the tireless efforts of my predecessor, Frank Aiken, in bringing the Irish NPT resolution to the General Assembly and I am equally aware of the benefits for humanity of his initiative which led ultimately to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  The NPT was designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to countries other than the five permanent members of the Security Council.  It was premised on those same five nuclear weapon states eliminating their nuclear weapons, of which, sadly, there is little prospect at the moment.</P>
    <P>In consequence, the NPT itself is in jeopardy, India and Pakistan having now demonstrated their intention to join the ranks of the nuclear weapons states.  There is a risk that other states in that region, parties to the NPT, may now reconsider their NPT commitments.  Equally, the nuclear capability of Israel represents a real threat to peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The international community has recognised the value of this Irish initiative by the overwhelming support it has given to our resolution.  It is significant also that the non-nuclear weapons states of NATO abstained on the text in recognition of the value which they attach to the initiative.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to sustain the momentum which we have set in motion at the next session <Col N="898" /> of the General Assembly, at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, at the IAEA in Vienna and at the 2000 Review and Implementation Conference of the Parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 40, 46, 109, 113, 115 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 13 and 16.  As I have already outlined, the Government continues to attach the highest priority to the speedy implementation of the British-Irish Agreement in all its aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the considerable progress we have made on the implementation of the Agreement, there is, as yet, no agreement on areas for North-South <Col N="899" /> implementation bodies, while the issue of decommissioning and the establishment of the shadow executive remains unresolved.  The Government will continue to work constructively in whatever way it can to seek to conclude agreement in these areas so as to move the process forward.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Government will continue to work constructively with the British Government and the parties to secure progress on implementation of the Agreement. Prime Minister Blair's visit to Ireland last month was part of the continuing close co-operation between the two Governments to ensure the earliest possible implementation of the Agreement.  I had a most useful meeting with the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, in London last Thursday evening on ways to move the process forward, while the Taoiseach had significant discussions with the British Prime Minister at the European Council in Vienna last weekend.</P>
    <P>Despite the substantial progress we have made since April, difficulties remain to be resolved as we move to implement the Agreement.  The people of this island have spoken on this Agreement and have given it their endorsement.  We, as political representatives, have a solemn duty to ensure that their will is delivered in full.</P>
    <P>I should mention that as we speak there are serious ongoing discussions taking place in Belfast on the North/South implementation bodies.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answer today to Priority Question No. 14 on the issue of Partnership for Peace, in which I set out my approach in a comprehensive manner.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of a referendum, raised in Deputy Gormley's question, I refer the Deputy to the detailed reply which I gave to him one week ago.  In my answer, I recalled that the Government gave a commitment at the time of the debate on ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty that, if the issue of a departure from Ireland's military neutrality were to arise in the future, the issue would be put to the people for their decision in a referendum.  I reiterate that commitment.  I am committed to our policy of military neutrality, and I wish to make it quite clear that no departure from this policy is envisaged. I am quite satisfied that there is no conflict between participation in Partnership for Peace and our policy of military neutrality.  Nonetheless, the opportunity of referring to the people, should the Government decide after listening to the debate that participation would be desirable, will arise in the course of the European Parliament election campaign next June, in which no doubt parties, including my own party, as well as our partners in Government, will have the opportunity to set out their approaches.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 69 and 112 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not have been appropriate for me to seek to intervene in the proceedings arising from the request for the extradation of General Pinochet, as the matter was entirely within the sole <Col N="901" /> competence of the British Home Secretary, Mr. Straw.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated also that, for similar reasons, the matter has not been raised at the General Affairs Council.  I understand that the approach followed by the United States Government has been broadly similar.</P>
    <P>Following Mr. Straw's decision, the question of General Pinochet's extradition is now once again in the domain of the British courts.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to a question on this issue on 5 November, abuses of human rights in any country are of concern to the entire international community.  Throughout the years of the Pinochet dictatorship, Ireland strongly condemned the violations of human rights carried out by the regime.  We expressed sympathy with the victims of those violations and we accepted Chilean refugees into Ireland.  While I believe that the perpetrators of all human rights abuses should be brought to justice, this can only be done in accordance with the jurisdiction and laws of the countries concerned, or within the framework of specific international legal instruments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world.  A steady flow of information is available from many sources, including local embassies, United Nations rapporteurs and working groups, the Commission on Human Rights and non-governmental organisations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, progress comes slowly in human rights.  Improvements are achieved usually over a long period of time.  I have provided detailed information to the House in my replies to other questions on specific cases of human rights violations, and I do not propose therefore to address all these cases on this occasion.  There are signs of some progress in certain areas, although it must be stressed that such progress is relative.  For example, dialogue is ongoing between the EU and China on human rights issues, which included contacts between the Chinese administration and NGOs, and we are in the process of extending technical co-operation to the Chinese authorities in a number of areas.  In addition, China has now signed two important international human rights instruments, namely the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and we look forward to their early ratification.</P>
      <P>Cambodia is now involved in the process of democratisation and Indonesia, which still faces massive problems, especially in relation to East Timor, is planning to hold democratic elections next summer.  The EU has welcomed the efforts of the Government of Colombia to find a solution to the long-lasting internal conflict there.  We also note continuing progress is being made in Guatemala. Positive developments have taken place recently in Nigeria, in particular the steps towards free and fair elections and the release of a number of political prisoners.  There has also been progress in relation to universal abolition of the death penalty.  Earlier this year Azerbaijan abolished the death penalty, and the Bulgarian Parliament has stated its intention to do the same, I hope before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have referred to a small number of countries, and there are many other instances I could mention. However, I would sound a note of caution. All efforts are to be welcomed, but in each of the cases I mentioned developments are in early stages and, while we welcome indications of progress, we remain concerned about the human <Col N="903" /> rights in each of the countries mentioned and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House that a European Union commemoration was held in Vienna on 10 December last to make the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Ireland was represented at that ceremony by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen.</P>
    <P>A solemn declaration of the European Union on human rights was issued during the event, which noted the attachment of the Union to human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The declaration set out EU achievements in the field of human rights and it also outlined how human rights might be strengthened, both internally and externally.</P>
    <P>In particular, the declaration stated that &ldquo;the universality and indivisibility of human rights and the responsibility for their protection and promotion, together with the promotion of pluralistic democracy and effective guarantees for the rule of law, constitute essential objectives for the Euorpean Union as a union of shared values and serve as a fundamental basis for our action&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland is seeking election to one of the two non-permanent seats on the Security Council which are designated for the &ldquo;Western Europe and Others&rdquo; group.  The election will take place in September-October 2000.  Successful candidates will require the support of two-thirds of the voting membership of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Elections to the Security Council have become increasingly competitive in recent years.  Ireland will be competing against Norway and Turkey for one of the two seats available in 2000.  The pace of our campaign has increased in recent months. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I have used all appropriate contacts with colleagues from other countries to seek support.  While it would not be appropriate to disclose commitments made by <Col N="904" /> other Governments, I can confirm that our candidature has received a very positive response.</P>
    <P>I will continue to use every opportunity to advance Ireland's candidacy both in contacts with other administrations in multilateral fora and in the course of bilateral visits abroad as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>As regards UN reform, in line with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium, Ireland has actively supported efforts to modernise and reform the United Nations system so that it can be more effective in responding to the complex and difficult challenges in the coming millennium.  Our priority is to secure agreement on the measures necessary to revitalise the organisation and to ensure more vigorous action in fulfilling its mandate under the UN Charter of maintaining international peace and security and promoting the economic and social development of all member states.  With our EU partners, we have given strong support to measures aimed at securing a better co-ordinated and more streamlined UN, which makes more effective use of personnel and financial resources, and at improving the setting of priorities for action by the UN.</P>
    <P>Ireland supports a reform of the composition of the Security Council which would make it more representative of the general membership of the UN.  We favour a balanced increase in the size of the council from the present 15 to between 20 and 25 members.  In this context, Ireland supports a small increase in the permanent membership, United States, China, Russia, France and the UK, selected on the basis of global influence and contribution to the work of the UN as well as considerations of equitable geographical distribution. We also favour an increase in the non-permanent membership with these new seats being allocated to the various regional groups.  In addition to the enlargement issue, Ireland favours improved and more transparent working methods of the council involving more frequent consultation between it and the General Assembly, the Secretary-General and other major organs of the UN system. We also see a need for more restrictive use of the veto power of the permanent members of the Security Council and we believe that the veto power should not be extended to new permanent members.</P>
    <P>Ireland has taken an active role in the discussions in New York on Security Council reform.  As a member of an informal group of ten small and medium-sized States, Ireland has played a significant bridge-building role in the debate.</P>

      <P>In June 1993, the Commission produced a positive opinion of Malta's application for EU membership. <Col N="905" /> It was subsequently decided that negotiations with Malta could begin six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Following elections in October 1996, however, the new Labour Government in Malta decided not to pursue its EU membership application.  Malta was, therefore, not included in the comprehensive and historic enlargement process which was launched by the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997.</P>
      <P>Early parliamentary elections held in Malta on 5 September 1998 resulted in victory for a Nationalist Party Government which favours EU membership.  The new Foreign Minister, Dr. de Marco, handed a letter to the Austrian Presidency on 14 September requesting that Malta's application for EU membership be reactivated.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council on 5-6 October the Commission was asked to review its own positive Opinion of June 1993.  In preparation of this document the Commission has addressed a series of detailed questions to the Maltese authorities, including in areas not covered in its original opinion such as common foreign security policy and justice and home affairs.  The Commission intends to present this updated report on Malta to the Council in time for the February General Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>At Vienna, 11-12 December, the European Council welcomed Malta's decision to reactivate its application for European Union membership and took note of the Commission's intention on the updating of its favourable opinion of 1993.</P>

      <P>As of 10 December 1998, the amount owing to Ireland by the UN arising from our participation in peacekeeping operations was £7.2 millon.  Most of these arrears are owed in respect of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, a peacekeeping operation to which Ireland provides a troop battalion of some 620 personnel as our most significant commitment to the maintenance of internatonal peace and security under the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>In the past six months, the UN repaid arrears to Ireland totalling some £5.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the significant repayment of arrears by the UN over the past six months, and the consistent downward trend in the level of arrears outstanding, the issue of arrears owing to Ireland is of considerable concern and this issue is pursued on an ongoing basis by the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations in New York.  We have consistently reiterated our view <Col N="906" /> that every effort should be made by the UN to reduce the amount of arrears owing to troop-contribution countries such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that the problem of subtantial arrears owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries is a direct result of the unprecedented financial crisis which the UN is currently experiencing and not due to any unwillingness on the part of the UN Secretariat to clear them.  This crisis has been caused by the failure of many member states, and in particular the US, to pay their assessed contributions to the UN regular and peace-keeping budgets in full and on time.  I welcome the recent reductions in US arrears to the UN.  However, the overall arrears problem has led to a situation in which the Secretary-General has been forced to delay normal reimbursements to troop contributors in order to deal with the serious cash flow situation facing the UN system.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, is firm in the demand that all member states of the UN should honour promptly and in full their financial obligations to the organisation under the UN Charter.</P>
    <P>We hope that efforts to resolve the UN financial crisis will lead to a reduction and eventual clearance of debts owing to Ireland and other troop-contributing countries.  I can assure the House that our Permanent Mission at New York will continue to make regular representations in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 114 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my reply of 2 July last, the Government wish to see an end to the US embargo imposed against Cuba.  We are working to that end in concert with our European Union partners.  In the UN General Assembly on 13 October, Ireland voted with our EU partners in favour of Resolution 53/4 which called for an end to the embargo.  The resolution was adopted with a significantly increased majority over its predecessor <Col N="907" /> last year &mdash; 153 votes in favour, two against, with 12 abstentions.</P>
    <P>The Helms-Burton Act allows the US to take extraterritorial measures against companies or individuals trafficking in expropriated property from Cuba.  Although the Act has little effect on Irish economic interests, we have shared partners' objections to it from the beginning and have played our full role in formulating the EU response to this measure.  We along with our EU partners have never accepted the US claim that the measure is justified by national security concerns and the US Administration has throughout the discussions, been made fully aware of this.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made towards reviewing the US embargo.  I have already welcomed President Clinton's announcement on 20 March on the opening of a number of contacts with Cuba.  Recently, a bipartisan group of US Senators wrote to the President to suggest the establishment of a national commission to undertake a comprehensive review of US policy towards Cuba.  This proposal is under positive consideration by the Administration, according to remarks attributed to a State Department spokesman.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the EU has defined a common position on Cuba and that this was achieved under Ireland's EU Presidency in 1996. The common position defines the EU's objective in its relations with Cuba as the facilitation of &ldquo;a peaceful transition to democracy and a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people&rdquo;.  The common position also makes clear that the EU's &ldquo;aim is to encourage a process of change, not to precipitate a collapse of authority which could bring about conflict, bloodshed and mass emigration&rdquo;. However, the common position also makes clear that &ldquo;wholehearted co-operation with Cuba is unavoidably inhibited by the persisent absence of fundamental human and political rights&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That, unfortunately, remains the case.  On 7 December last, the General Affairs Council reiterated the provisions of the common position. Havana must also play its part if Cuba wishes its international relations to be more significantly improved.</P>
    <P>For its part, the EU in line with its policy of encouragement rather than isolation, has acceded to Cuba's request for observer status, as of 30 September last, at the negotiations for a new Lomé Convention.  Full membership of the convention, and other full co-operation, must depend on real, substantial progress in respecting human rights and democracy.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile it is good to note that, as a result of the Pope's visit to the island, Cubans are to be permitted, for a second successive year, to celebrate Christmas.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations with Cuba, because of the modest size of our diplomatic service we are not in a position to establish such relations at the present <Col N="908" /> time, even on a non-resident basis.  This does not prevent the maintenance of appropriate contacts between our two governments.</P>

      <P>The Anglo-Irish Secretariat, which was established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement will cease to exist on the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement and the transfer of powers to the new institutions, including the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and its standing joint Secretariat.

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 39 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The EU has played a very active role in addressing the question of Kosovo since the onset of the crisis.  The meetings of the General Affairs Council, the most recent on 7 December, have concentrated in particular on the Union's operational input and how it could be enhanced through further initiatives.</P>
      <P>I remain very concerned about the plight of refugees and displaced persons in Kosovo.  This concern is shared fully by my EU colleagues and we have addressed this question in detail at all of our recent meetings.  The combined contribution of EU member states and the Commission to humanitarian assistance already this year has amounted to 44 million ECUS.  Ireland has already contributed £200,000 bilaterally and further assistance on the basis of actual need will be considered.</P>
      <P>As the crisis intensified in Kosovo over the summer it was the European Community Monitoring Mission, ECMM, which initially had the sole international presence on the ground.</P>
      <P>ECMM provided the core and most of the personnel and material resources for the Kosovo Diplomatic Monitor Mission, KDOM, which was subsequently established, with the addition of US and Russian personnel, to enable wider monitoring. The KDOM is still fully operational.</P>
      <P>Now that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, has been entrusted with the task of establishing its Kosovo Verification Mission, on foot of the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreements and a UN Security Council Resolution, it will subsume the KDOM into its work as soon as it becomes fully operational.  This is expected to happen in the next week or so.</P>
      <P>The Kosovo Verification Missison will entail the deployment of two thousand persons on the ground to verify that the demands of UN Security Council Resolutions are being complied with. One such demand is to allow the safe return of refugees and displaced persons, and to put in place the necessary conditions for this to happen. The large-scale presence of the mission will endeavour to provide the local population with the necessary reassurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At last week's meeting of the General Affairs Council, it was established that combined contribution to the Kosovo Verification Mission will be <Col N="910" /> 1,100 out of the overall total of 2,000 verifiers, and that our combined national contributions to the OSCE's common budget will amount to 66 per cent of the total.  Ireland will be contributing up to 30 verifiers, as well as paying its assessed share of the common budget.</P>
    <P>The General Affairs Council reviewed the situation and welcomed the fact that the considerable and flexible humanitarian assistance from the EU and its member states had already allowed refugees and displaced persons to begin returning to their homes; encouraged the Commission to continue responding flexibily and rapidly to emergency needs; noted that the EU would play a special role on reconstruction issues; noted the Commission's intention to organize an expert level meeting on overall damage assessment in early 1999; requested its competent bodies to ensure that the overall amount for reconstruction assistance in particular with regard to Kosovo meets the needs, and EU political priorities and urged the OSCE to present a detailed request for EU funding for demining to enable the competent bodies to examine it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Demining will be necessary in several areas to provide a safe and secure environment for returnees.</P>
    <P>Actual conditions on the ground in Kosovo will be crucial in order for these plans to be put fully into effect.  It is therefore vital that progress be made towards a political solution, as required also by the Security Council Resolutions.  As part of the effort to achieve this objective the EU appointed early in October a Special Envoy to work with the US Special Envoy on brokering an agreement between the Serb and Albanian sides. Such an agreement would then allow the sides to enter into direct negotiations.  These intensive diplomatic efforts are continuing.</P>
    <P>If progress is to be made which would lead to peace and reconciliation among the sides in Kosovo, then atrocities must be investigated and those responsible brought to justice.  The UN Security Council in its Resolutions makes this quite clear and it expects co-operation with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as well as with other international investigators. The EU has established a forensic mission to carry out such investigations, and has prevailed with difficulty on the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to allow it to operate in Kosovo.  The work of this mission will have the full support of the EU.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 140, 146 and 147 together.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with our EU partners and other concerned states, the Government continually monitors the human rights situation in many countries throughout the world.  A steady flow of information is available from many sources including local embassies, United Nations rapporteurs and working groups, the Commission on Human Rights, NGOs and so forth.  Through these various channels, many instances of human rights abuses are constantly brought to my attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> On many occasions I have commented publicly on those situations which give rise to grave concern, in a national capacity and as a member of the European Union.  These concerns have also been raised on a consistent basis by this country's representatives at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights.  The recent EU statement delivered at the Third Committee of the General Assembly expressed our common disquiet at human rights violations in certain areas of the world which are of particular concern at present, including Afghanistan, Burma, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Kosovo.</P>
    <P>Applying concentrated international pressure through multilateral organisations, such as the EU, UN and the Council of Europe, is one of the most effective means of combating human rights abuses and, moreover, has resulted in an improvement of the situation in some countries, for example, the commitment of the Nigerian Government to move into a programme of democratisation and the release of a number of political prisoners; the steps being taken in Indonesia to hold democratic elections next summer and Cambodia working through a process of democratisation. There has also been progress in relation to universal abolition of the death penalty. Earlier this year Azerbaijan abolished the death penalty and the Bulgarian Parliament has stated its intention to do the same, hopefully before the end of this month.  We will continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in all of these countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to fulfil our obligation to promote the observance of universal human rights standards.  We will also continue to voice our concerns, wherever possible in partnership with other like-minded countries, in international fora, such as the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Humanh Rights, the Council of Europe and the OSCE.</P>

    <P>The Government has frequently expressed to the British authorities its concerns regarding the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

      <P>The Statute of the International Criminal Court will enter into force on the first day of the month after the 60th day following the date of deposit of the 60th instrument of ratification.  In other words, 60 states must ratify the statute before it can come into effect.  To date, over 60 states have signed the statute but none has yet ratified. Ireland signed the Statute of the International Criminal Court, subject to ratification, on 7 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a permanent international criminal court is something which Ireland has advocated for many years and the Government took an active part in the development of the court's founding statute at the Rome conference.  The adoption of the court's statute at the Rome conference was a major achievement which brings the establishment of an independent and effective international criminal court much closer to realisation.  As the Deputy points out in his question the court will have jurisdiction over the most heinous crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</P>
      <P>The successful establishment of the international criminal court is therefore of major significance for the international community and Ireland will continue to support this endeavour by taking appropriate action to ratify the Rome statute as soon as possible, and by participating in the work of the preparatory commission which will meet in New York next year to elaborate the court's rules of evidence, procedure and other matters necessary for its effective operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the ratification process, the Statute is a long and complex document which includes 13 parts and 128 articles.  As a first step these will require careful and detailed consideration in order to determine the nature and scope of the legal and administrative measures which may need to be adopted in order for the State to be in a position to meet is obligations under the statute.  The State may proceed to ratify the statute <Col N="914" /> only when all the necessary legal and administrative measures have been put in place.  I am not in a position at this point to say how long this process might take, but I assure the Deputy that it will be given a high priority.</P>

      <P>The accession process was launched by the 15 member states, the ten central and eastern European countries and Cyprus on 30 March 1998. Intergovernmental conferences to begin accession negotiations were inaugurated the following day with Hungary, Poland, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Cyprus, the &ldquo;<i>five plus one</i>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<i>ins</i>&rdquo;.  At the same time, the preparation of negotiations with Slovakia, Lithuania, Romania, Latvia, and Bulgaria, the &ldquo;<i>preins</i>&rdquo;, is being expedited, in particular through an analytical examination of their national legislation against the requirements of the Union's <i>acquis.</i></P>
      <P>Intergovernmental accession conferences at ministerial level were held between the European Union and five plus one candidate countries <i>en marge</i> of the General Affairs Council on 10 November last.  Position papers on the seven chapters of the <i>acquis</i> where screening is complete &mdash; science and research; telecommunications; education and training; culture; audio-visual and media; industrial policy; small and medium sized companies &mdash; were exchanged between the Union and each of the candidates.  While these chapters were not expected to cause major difficulties, in any event, the member states and the candidate countries are highly satisfied with progress made to date.</P>
      <P>Intensive work on the accession process will continue under the incoming German Presidency. They hope to open substantive negotiations on at least another seven chapters of the <i>acquis</i> and possibly more.  Both Germany and Finland, which takes over the Presidency in the second half of 1999, have indicated their determination to keep up the momentum in the accession negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners remain deeply concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Angola and the danger of a return to widespread conflict and further suffering for the Angolan people.  The last occasion upon which <Col N="915" /> the situation in Angola was considered at ministerial level by the Union was at the EU Council of Development Ministers in Brussels on 30 November at which Ireland was represented by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>The discussion of the council focused on the ongoing efforts ro reinvigorate the peace process in Angola through full compliance with the Lusaka protocol and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.  In particular, we wish to see the UNITA leadership comply immediately with its obligations as agreed under the Lusaka protocol, including the complete demilitarisation of its forces and full co-operation in the immediate and unconditional extension of state administration throughout the national territory. At the same time we stongly support the efforts being made by the special representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Issa Diallo, to resolve the current impasse.  We call on both the Government and UNITA to assist him in fulfilling his urgent task.</P>
      <P>It is important that there should be full compliance with UN sanctions in support of the peace process.  This will be assisted by implementation of the relevant EU common position and council regulations.  Our concerns have also been addressed in recent Union declarations and troika <i>démarches</i> and in discussions with African states at the ministerial meeting of the EU and the Southern African Development Community in Vienna on 3-4 November.  We support and welcome the adoption of Resolution 1313 by the UN Security Council on 3 December, extending the mandate of the UN observer mission in Angola. Every effort is being made by the Government, including in conjunction with our EU and UN partners, to reinstate a meaningful political dialogue in Angola as an alternative to the resumption of civil war.</P>

      <P>The General Affairs Council considered the situation in Russia at its meeting on 6-7 December 1998.  The council agreed on a progress report developing a comprehensive EU policy towards Russia which covers economic, trade, and political issues.  The report also identifies a number of priority areas for EU assistance to Russia, including food and humanitarian assistance, banking reform, tax collection, WTO accession, agriculture, nuclear safety and nuclear waste management. The report was welcomed by the Vienna European Council which reaffirmed Russia's importance as strategic partner as demonstrated by the EU-Russia summit in Vienna on 27 <Col N="916" /> October.  The European Council also decided that Russia should be one of the first subjects for a common strategy of the European Union, under Article J3 of the Amsterdam Treaty, when that Treaty enters into effect.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council looked forward to receiving the proposal on EU food aid for Russia which the Commission subsequently delivered to the council on 9 December.  It welcomed the intention of the Commission to submit the draft Memorandum of Understanding, MoU, on the modalities and conditions for such aid negotiated with the Russian authorities on the basis of the mandate provided by the council of 24 November. The council underlined the importance of adequate control mechanisms for the delivery of aid and the subsequent use of revenues accruing from the sale of such aid, including detailed monthly reports by the Russian authorities on implementation of the MoU; transparency of Russian operations; independent third party monitoring; possible checks at any stage by the Court of Auditors; and delivery of the aid in tranches with a possibility of suspension of the aid in case of irregularities.</P>
      <P>The General Affairs Council also stressed the need for close co-ordination with the United States on the issue.  It decided to review the implementation of food aid at forthcoming sessions on the basis of reports by the Commission. The council noted the Commission's intention to put aside some 20 MECUs from TACIS 1999 to alleviate consequences of the Russian crisis on neighbouring countries, on the basis that this would be consistent with the long-term priorities of EU assistance programmes for Russia.  It invited the Commission to provide further information on this issue.  The European Council urged the General Affairs Council to decide as soon as possible on food aid to Russia, accompanied by adequate control mechanisms.</P>

      <P>The Government is following with concern the current developments in the Middle East peace process arising from the problems which emerged in the context of the implementation of the Wye River Memorandum signed on 23 October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware the Wye agreement provided for a redeployment of Israeli troops from 13 per cent of the occupied territories over a 12 week period.  This redeployment was to be accompanied by actions on the Palestinian side relating to the removal of anti-Israeli clauses in the Palestinian Charter and by the taking of certain specific measures in the security field.  A committee was to be set up to oversee the negiotiatons <Col N="917" /> on the final status issues involving the status of Jerusalem, refugees, water, settlements and borders.  Israel also undertook to release 750 Palestinian prisoners over a 12 week period.</P>
    <P>The Wye agreement also provided for a meeting of a donor conference to provide funds for the next five years for the latest stage of the process. This took place at Washington on 30 November. A total of $3 billion for the next five years was pledged by the international community. Ireland pledged $10m on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the agreement has been hindered by numerous difficulties and differences of interpretation which have arisen.  The Joint Israeli-Palestinian Committee set up under Wye to discuss final status issues has met only once. Israel has indicated that it will release only prisoners who have not been convicted on charges of violence.  For its part Israel has complained that the Palestinian side have not delivered on their commitments.  There has been renewed rioting in the streets and unfortunately several deaths have occurred.</P>
    <P>Tension was heightened when, on 2 December, it was reported that the Israeli cabinet had stipulated three new conditions to be met before further redeployments could take place, providing that the Palestinians abandon publicly plans to proclaim an independent state on 4 May 1999, cease demanding the release of Palestinian political prisoners, and halt incitement to anti-Israeli violence.</P>
    <P>The Palestinian cabinet categorically rejected these demands which they viewed as additional conditions for the implementation of the Wye agreement.</P>
    <P>Against this background, political tensions have continued to arise.  Some of the Palestinian political detainees held in Israeli jails are on hunger strike and the Israeli Government has suspended the next stage of the Israeli troop redeployment, which was scheduled to take place on 18 December.</P>
    <P>I hope that the recent visit by President Clinton to the region will have helped to restore confidence on both sides in the Peace Process.</P>
    <P>The European Union, which has supported the entire peace process, particularly the part played by the US, is following developments closely.  The General Affairs Council meeting on 7 December, which I attended, issued a statement which strongly urged both sides to exercise restraint and to continue to implement the Wye agreement. The council also noted with satisfaction the outcome of the Washington donor conference of 30 November.  I and my fellow EU Foreign Ministers also discussed the situation in some detail when we met last week during the European Council at Vienna.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that I will continue to monitor the situation in the Middle East and ensure that we and our EU partners will do everything we can to promote the peace process.</P>

      <P>I have read with a deep sense of shock the latest media reports which indicate that 52 people were recently masssacred and over a dozen women abducted from a village 200 kilometres west of Algiers.  I call on the Algerian Government to do all in its power to have the abducted women returned and the perpetrators of this horrible massacre brought to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This latest atrocity unfortunately appears to be only one of a series.  Given the pattern of violence of previous years &mdash; when such killings have risen to a peak during the holy month of Ramadan &mdash;<Col N="920" /> there is a clear danger that the Algerian people may be heading into a period of intense violence.</P>
    <P>This tragedy takes place against a situation where severe restrictions have been imposed on the media and where the political system is engaged in preparations for a presidential election which has recently been postponed from February to April next.  The economic situation facing Algeria has also recently severely deteriorated, due to a sharp fall in oil prices, leading to a rise in social tensions.  The resulting situation means that some of the basic causes of the current appalling situation, such as the lack of democratisation and accountability, cannot be addressed adequately.</P>
    <P>I have already informed the Dáil on the outcome of the most recent EU troika meeting with the Algerian Foreign Minister.  Together with our EU partners we continue to monitor the ongoing situation and will take whatever steps are necessary to bring home to the Algerian authorities our very deep feelings of repugnance at the current situation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that Ireland, in the initial aftermath of hurricane Mitch, responded swiftly and generously to the humanitarian crisis in central America by approving a total of £550,000 from the emergency humanitarian assistance fund administered by my Department.  Ireland's assistance is being disbursed through Trócaire, APSO, the International Federation of the Red Cross, the World Health Organisation and the World Food Programme.  The amount of assistance received by each agency and its purpose is as follows: grants totaling £100,000 to Trócaire for immediate relief, which includes meeting the needs in nine severely affected municipalities in Honduras; grants totaling £80,000 to ASPO for humanitarian assistance in Honduras and Nicaragua; a grant of £120,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross.  The federation, along with its national societies, is able to disburse these funds to where they are most needed, including other countries such as Guatemala and El Salvador; a grant of £100,000 to the World Health Organisation for emergency medical supplies on behalf of all countries affected within the region; and a grant of £150,000 to the World Food Programme towards its emergency feeding operation for the most vulnerable victims of the hurricane in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trócaire and APSO have spent many years carrying out excellent development projects <Col N="922" /> throughout the region.  Years of painstaking development were destroyed in one blow as many of these projects were literally swept away.  Staff have now been redeployed in the short-term in order to maintain some level of essential services to the people.</P>
    <P>In Honduras and Nicaragua, APSO are organising the supply of food, medicine and clothing for the communities with which they work.  APSO has reported the urgent need for fast growing rice and bean seed in the hope of producing some food within the next three months.  Part of the moneys allocated to APSO is being used to supply emergency medical kits in some of the most affected areas of Honduras.  To avoid duplication, APSO is co-ordinating closely with other international agencies and particularly with Trócaire to whom it has provided a number of personnel. Trócaire is focusing on emergency assistance in the form of family food packages.</P>
    <P>The Government intends to remain engaged with the reconstruction effort and we are open to providing further aid, especially for rehabilitation. Following intial discussion at the General Affairs Council on 23 November, EU Development Ministers met on 30 November and agreed that, given the scale of the disaster, the international community as a whole must show solidarity with these countries both through the provision of emergency and rehabilitation assistance and in tackling the long-term social, economic and environmental issues invovled.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of the international effort has already started.  In Washington on 10-11 December the Inter-American Development Bank hosted a consultative group meeting of donors, international organisations and affected countries.  The need to co-ordinate ongoing reconstruction assistance, and to include civil society, NGOs and the private sector in this co-ordination process was recognised.  A further meeting of the consultative group will be held from 25-28 May 1999 in Stockholm.</P>

With regard to the question of Ireland's imminent participation in EMU, the Deputy will also be aware that the Minister for Finance established the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland on 5 May 1998.  The board has two basic tasks: to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover to the euro and to provide public and consumer information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>In May of this year, prior to the Omagh outrage, the Government gave approval for a review of the services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, accepted the invitation of my collegue, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, to carry out this important task on behalf of the Government.  As the Taoiseach said in his statement on the Omagh bombing in the Dáil on 2 September, &ldquo;the Government is always conscious of all the victims of violence. All our energies, and all our efforts are focused on trying to ensure that there are no more victims, no more tragedies&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Mr. Wilson, on an ongoing basis, is meeting with the victims and their relatives, with a view to assessing the services and arrangements available to meet their needs.  It is expected that Mr. Wilson will report back to Government in early 1999.</P>
      <P>It is intended that this report will then form the basis of a comprehensive and inclusive response to the needs of victims.</P>
      <P>The Government would prefer to await the outcome of the proposals of the Victims Commission before deciding on any specific measures in support of victims of violence, either in Omagh or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>As the issue of duty free sales is a taxation matter, <Col N="924" /> it falls, in the first instance, within the remit of the ECOFIN Council and therefore of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Government has supported a re-examination of the duty free issue in the ECOFIN Council and in other fora as appropriate.</P>
      <P>When the matter arose at a discussion over lunch at the General Affairs Council on 7 December Ireland was again one of the member states to press for the issue to be re-examined.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that, at its meeting in Vienna on 11 and 12 December, the European Council considered the 1991 decision to abolish duty free and asked the Commission and the ECOFIN Council to examine by March 1999 the problems which could arise with regard to employment and to address, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, possible means of tackling these problems, including the possibilty of a limited extension of transitional arrangements.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was written by Mr. R. Langendries, President of the Belgian Chamber of Representatives.  It was presented to an informal conference of presidents of parliaments of EU member states and the European Parliament, which was held in Vienna on 1 December 1998, and the report formed the basis for debate at that conference.  Ireland was represented at the conference by the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>The report deals with the role that the European and national parliaments can play in the ongoing debate on democratic legitimacy and institutional reform in the European Union, particularly in the context of the enhanced role for national parliaments set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  I understand the report has now been brought to the attention of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  While my Department has seen the reports, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any review of the report being carried out by the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government's views on democratic legitimacy and institutional reform have been made known to the committee, at its request, from time to time.  With regard to democratic legitimacy, the Government fully supports the provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam for better provision of information to national parliaments; for an enhanced role for COSAC, the Conference of European Affairs Committees of <Col N="925" /> the National Parliaments of the European Union, the European Parliament and the Applicant States, and for a strengthened legislative role for the European Parliament.  With regard to institutional reform, the Government's view firmly stated on previous occasions is that every member state must retain the right to nominate a full member of the Commission college.</P>

      <P>Four telecommunications workers employed by a British company who were kidnapped in Chechnya on 3 October were murdered last week.  One of those killed was Darren Hickey whose parents are from Ireland and who was therefore an Irish citizen but who was travelling on a British passport.

      <P>At my direction, our Ambassador to Russia has met the Chechen President's Acting Representative in Moscow and conveyed the Irish Government's strong condemnation of the killings.  The Ambassador informed the Chechen authorities that the killing of Mr. Hickey and his companions has caused revulsion in Ireland and he expressed the Government's hope that every effort will be made to track down those responsible.  Our Ambassador has also communicated these messages to the Russian Foreign and Interior Ministries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken note of Earthaction's concerns with regard to an effective international response to genocide, aggression and mass murder, and particularly regarding the strengthening of the UN's reaction capacity, and will study the proposals put forward.  In this 50th anniversary year of the adoption of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, it is an appropriate moment to assess the overall effectiveness of international efforts and mechanisms aimed at preventing acts of genocide and punishing the perpetrators of such crimes.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the EU member states at a UN debate to mark this anniversary on 2 December last, the Austrian Presidency stated that the adoption of the Genocide Convention was an important first step towards the effective prevention and punishment of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  However, it was also noted that, despite this basic framework of human rights and humanitarian law, &ldquo;the world continues to witness massive violations of human rights, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  From Cambodia to the Balkans and the Great Lakes region in Africa, the international community has often failed to prevent and stop such acts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this context, recent efforts to prosecute and try perpetrators of such crimes are encouraging &mdash; in this regard, I might mention the <i>ad-hoc</i> tribunals set up to deal with the outrageous crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, as well as the agreement reached earlier this year on the establishment of an International Criminal Court.  However, we must also examine ways in which the international community can respond more rapidly to developing crises in order to prevent such acts occurring.</P>
      <P>In relation to the request to governments to offer troops in a stand-by capacity, I confirm to the House that Ireland signed the UN Standby Arrangements System Memorandum of Understanding on 15 October 1998.  This commits 850 Irish troops to the UNSAS; the UN may request deployment of Irish troops as and when a suitable mission arises.  While the bulk of the personnel Ireland has committed to UNSAS are already deployed with UN peacekeeping missions, signature of the UNSAS Memorandum underlines Ireland's continued readiness to participate in UN peacekeeping missions.</P>
      <P>Ireland strongly believes in an enhanced reaction capacity for the UN to deal with crisis situations and our commitment to UNSAS is a concrete demonstration of our belief.  Ireland contributed US$25,000 in 1997 to the trust fund for the establishment of a Rapidly Deployable Mission Headquarters (RDMHQ) at the UN in</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> New York, which would be responsible for the planning of rapid deployment missions.  The RDMHQ will be established as part of the reorganisation of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, beginning in March 1999, and it is hoped that the RDMHQ will become fully operational during the course of 1999.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The labour inspectorate of my Department is responsible for the enforcement of worker rights set down in a variety of labour legislation and of statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment of workers employed in sectors covered by Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) and registered employment agreements (REAs).  The inspectorate is comprised of 11 inspectors, two of whom are job-sharing, who are provided with administrative back-up support by a staff of five officials.  The legislation in respect of which the inspectorate has an enforcement function comprises: Employment Agency Act, 1971, Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-1991, Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, Payment of Wages Act, 1991, Worker Protection (Regular Part-Time Employees) Act, 1991, Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act, 1984-1991, European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations, 1980, Protection of Employment Act, 1997, Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, Parental Leave Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>They have no enforcement function, however, in respect of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977-1993, the Terms of Employment Information Act, 1994, or the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1991, as legal remedy to aggrieved parties in these cases is available <i>via</i> the Employment Appeals Tribunal and-or the Rights Commissioner Service.</P>
      <P>Labour law enforcement activity is driven by three factors: by complaints and allegations made against individual employers or sectors of employment by unions or aggrieved employees; by random or spot-check investigation, and by officially-determined policy with resepet to enforcement.</P>
      <P>In conducting their work, the inspectors generally operate within normal office hours. Appended to this reply are tables detailing the number of inspections carried out under the above-named worker protection legislation in 1997, totalling 1,671 and in the period January-October 1998, totalling 1,022: approximately 5 per cent of these inspections were generated by complaints received.  During the same period the number of inspections carried out under ERO's and REA's was 3,990 in 1997 and 2,802 in 1998 (to 31-10-98).</P>
      <P>From time to time and resulting from on-going official reveiw of enforcement policy, and consistent with the resources available to me, individual sectors are identified as appropriate for sustained and intensified investigation by the inspectorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> The factors which give rise to selection for such investigation are varied but typically include such considerations as: the volume of complaints-representations made about worker rights infringe-ments in a particular sector; seasonality factors which, in a particular sector, might lead to surges of production-output and to consequential increase in time worked by the employee or the hiring of additional temporary labour and the scale of workspace abuse of employee rights and entitlements brought to light in the course of inspection work or through media reporting.</P>
    <P>In the course of summer 1998, for example, a concentration of inspection-enforcement work was focused for two weeks on the co-operative sector in response to allegations made in the media concerning possible abuse of the rights-entitlements of staff temporarily employed for summer work in that sector.  The catering sector nationwide will be subjected, in the course of 1999, to a prolonged period of intensified investigation-enforcement activity by the labour inspectorate, such activity to be conducted in parallel with an information-advertising campaign designed to heighten awareness of the responsibilities of employers and of the rights and entitlements of employees who operate in the catering business.  In turn other sectors will &mdash; where the indications point to a widespread abuse of worker rights-entitlements &mdash; to be selected for a similar enforcement approach.</P>
    <P>As regards the statistical likelihood of any particular firm being the subject of an inspection, overall policy is aimed at ensuring an inspection of each employer featured on my Department's register of employment premises takes place approximately once every three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In July 1997, our Department developed a year 2000 plan which identified all of the IT systems and applications in operation within our Department and the action necessary in relation to each to ensure they are year 2000 compliant.  An internal year 2000 monitoring committee was set up with the remit of overseeing progress on the implementation of the year 2000 compliance plan for the Department and for the agencies which come within our Department's remit.  This committee meets fortnightly to ensure continuous and scheduled progress on the project.</P>
      <P>Each of the agencies is in the course of implementing its year 2000 plan.  The agencies are required to report to the Department on a quarterly basis updating on progress in implementing their year 2000 plan.  The agency reports are reviewed by the Department's internal year 2000 monitoring committee and my follow-up action is identified and acted upon.</P>
      <P>In September 1997, the Government set up an independent monitoring committee to oversee progress in relation to year 2000 compliance throughout the entire civil and public service. This committee reports regularly to Government on progress being made within each Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 2000 project for our Department is progressing well and this is borne out in the reports prepared for Government by the monitoring committee.  We are confident that the schedule <Col N="933" /> set for implementation of the year 2000 projects in our Department are realistic and will be met.</P>
    <P>The expenditure for the Department's Year 2000 plan for 1998 will amount to £45,000.  In 1999, an amount of £95,000 is specifically committed in the Estimates for this project.</P>
    <P>Two staff members have been assigned fulltime to the year 2000 project and others are assigned as the need arises.  Our Department has also contracted the services of a firm of outside consultants to provide support with the overall year 2000 plan.  Consultants are being retained to provide support in respect of a number of specific systems which require remedial action.</P>

      <P>The preventative strategy of early intervention with all young unemployed persons before six months of unemployment which is a key element of the Employment Action Plan, commenced on 1 September last.  From that date all such young persons are being referred to a FÁS vocational guidance interview with a view to offering them a job or other employability support i.e. a place on a training or education course or a place on an employment scheme.</P>
      <P>Some of the key findings, at this early stage in the process are that, of the 884 young persons referred in September, 51 per cent had been interviewed by FÁS, by end October 1998, a further 1 per cent were scheduled for interview and 4 per cent were already engaged with the local employment service.  The remaining 44 per cent had failed to attend for interview.  Taking interviewees and those who did not attend as a group, 41 per cent of such persons for whom an interview was scheduled in September had left the live register by end October 1998.</P>
      <P>I have recently published full results of the outcomes of the first month of implementation of the preventive strategy for young persons.  I have arranged to have a copy of the report forwarded to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996, came into operation on 2 January 1997.</P>
      <P>Breaches of the Act may come to the attention of my Department either by way of complaint by an individual employee or other concerned person or by routine inspections carried out by my Department's labour inspectorate.  Inspectors have powers to enter places of work, question employers and employees and examine records.</P>
      <P>Where it appears an employer has failed to comply with the legislation, the matter is referred to my legal advisers to consider whether legal proceedings may be instituted against the employer concerned in respect of the alleged breach of the Act.  Certain offences may be prosecuted by the trade union of which the employee is a member.  A person found guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £1,500 and a further £250 a day for a continuing offence.</P>
      <P>It is also open to the parent or guardian of a child or a young person to present a complaint to a Rights Commissioner that an employer has contravened section 13 &mdash; preservation of existing rates of pay and conditions &mdash; or section 17 &mdash; refusal to co-operate with an employer in breaching the Act.  An employer or employee may appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal from a recommendation of a rights commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the increased use by individuals and private companies of information technology as a preferred means of conducting business.  As Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I consider it very much my role to actively encourage and facilitiate the use of IT as a means of doing business.</P>
      <P>For some considerable time now, it has been possible to communicate with staff at all levels within my Department by Internet mail.  In common with other Government Departments, my Deparment has populated a website on the worldwide web which is used to advertise the services provided by the Department together with relevant contact points.  The website is used extensively to publish reports and other up to date information about my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department does not run any schemes either to grant-aid or assist education in Information Technology.</P>
      <P>In the matter of e-commerce, my Department is at the forefront in bringing forward a number of initiatives to facilitate the conduct of business through the use of information technology.  One example of e-commerce in action in my Department relates to the facility to file applications for import licences over the Internet.  There are a number of other initiatives in the pipeline although some are as yet in the early stages of development.  During the course of 1999, I intend to bring a number of e-commerce projects to fruition within my Department.  One such project relates to the facility to enable insurance companies to submit their annual financial returns to my Department over the Internet.  A similar project in the companies registration office would enable companies to file their returns to the office electronically. These initiatives are broadly welcomed by the business community as they enable a more efficient method of doing business.  I anticipate that these type of initiatives will pave the way forward and that e-commerce will, in the future become the way to do business.</P>

      <P>Funds for the training by employers of their staff are included in Subhead K2 of my Departments Vote.  The sum provided in the 1999 Estimate under this subhead is £24.530 million.  The corresponding figure for 1998 is £15.987 million.  The main components of the subhead are apprenticeship and the training support scheme.</P>
      <P>Additional funds are provided from the European Social Fund (ESF) for these activities.  The combined Exchequer-ESF expenditure to end November 1998 on these activities was £23.763 million.</P>
      <P>As regards the bodies involved, FÁS is the delivery agent for the funds referred to above.  In 1999, both FÁS and Enterprise Ireland will administer training support scheme funds to their respective client companies.</P>
      <P>A provision of £3 million was also included in the 1998 Estimates under Subhead K8 for the introduction of an enterprise-led pilot training networks programme.  However, as the commencement of the programme has been delayed, it is expected that only a small amount of the 1998 funding, covering initial setup costs, will be drawn down this year.  An allocation of £3 million is being made available to the programme for 1999. This will be supplemented by a further £2.4 million, approximately, from the European Social Fund.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy is to develop forestry to a scale and in a manner which maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis and which is compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>The target for annual broadleaf afforestation is and will continue to be 20 per cent of total annual afforestation.  A recent survey has shown that broadleaf trees account for 21 per cent of Ireland's forests.</P>
      <P>In the years 1995 to 1997 the level of broadleaf afforestation averaged 19.6 per cent of total afforestation. Native broadleaf afforestation, of which the main species planted are oak and ash, represented 11.6 per cent of total afforestation for the same period.</P>

      <P>I have tasked my Department and the agencies to put in place action programmes to address the year 2000 issue for IT systems, office equipment and other plant.  The Department is progressing a year 2000 compliance programme with the aim of achieving compliance by mid-1999. Similar programmes are being progressed by our agencies.  My overriding priority is to ensure that the key business functions of the Department and its agencies will continue without disruption of service to our key customers.</P>
      <P>The Department's programme includes finalising its inventory of IT systems and plant and equipment, assessment of compliance of identified systems, project scheduling and work prioritisation to achieve compliance.  Timetables for the assessment and testing of the most critical systems to avoid any interruption to the Department's business have been drawn up.</P>
      <P>The Department has advertised for the supply of operating systems, hardware and backup solutions with a view to having the remedies achieved my mid-January.  The following is the schedule of programme compliance currently being progressed:</P>
      <P>31 December 1998 &mdash; commence testing of systems critical to business; advertise for outside expertise to test and modify PCs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>31 January 1999 &mdash; installation of upgrades to <Col N="944" /> systems; replacement of non-compliant hardware.</P>
    <P>February-March 1969, advertise for upgrading of software packages.</P>
    <P>My Department has written to all bodies under its aegis, both in November 1997 and again September 1998, requesting information on the level of work required in order to ensure year 2000 compliance.  The responses received indicate a high level of awareness of the issues concerned and show that appropriate action is being taken to ensure timely compliance of relevant IT systems.</P>
    <P>During 1998 all costs involved in preparing for the year 2000 problem are being met from within the existing budget for IT expenditure.  An additional budget of £300,000 is being provided during 1999 specifically to address expected additional expenses related to the issue.</P>
    <P>Four additional staff, including one specialist employed on a consultancy basis, have been assigned to the Department's IT unit to upgrade the Department's IT capability generally including year 2000 compliance requirements.</P>

      <P>I have received a copy of the study referred to by the Deputy.  I am advised that Kennedy Pier is the property of the Port of Cork Company and falls within that company's jurisdictional area.  Under the Harbours Act, 1996, the port company is statutorily mandated to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour and to provide such facilities, services, accommodation and land for ships, goods and passengers as it considers necessary.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the Port of Cork Company has indicated to the Cobh Fishermen's Association that it could make no commitment to the funding of any future development of Kennedy Pier.  Port development plans are subject to ongoing review and any development of port property or facilities, irrespective of the funding mechanism, remains a matter for the port company to determine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for the renewal of the whitefish fleet which I launched in June involves a package of measures to provide for the renewal and modernisation of the whitefish fleet. I recently announced successful applications for grant and for the introduction of 31 new vessels, 16 of these vessels will be based in Donegal.  I will be announcing grant approvals for the introduction of modern second hand vessels into the fleet and for vessel modernisation shortly.  I have also <Col N="946" /> announced three rounds of approvals for support for safety equipment to date.  I consider this vessel safety equipment scheme of vital importance. The aim of this scheme is to encourage vessel owners to fit out vessels with specific on-board safety equipment.  Improved safety equipment on board vessels can play a vital part in the ongoing battle to protect life at sea.  The closing date for applications for safety grants is the last day of each month and I will ensure that decisions are taken quickly.</P>
      <P>The programme, which already supports investment of £67 million is the biggest ever single financial initiative in the whitefish sector. The objective of the programme is to increase competitiveness, safeguard jobs in our coastal regions and preserve sustainable fishing as an economic way of life in these communities.  I am confident the programme will deliver on these objectives.</P>

      <Quest>if he will give details of a recent decision to settle 350 Bosnian and 200 Vietnamese immigrants in the State in order to facilitate family reunification; the reasons for this decision; Ireland's obligations in this regard; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government has responded from time to time to appeals from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to accept groups of refugees in response to specific international crisis situations.  Refugees who come to Ireland in this way do so under specific Government decisions and are known as programme refugees.  The main groups of programme refugees in Ireland are Vietnamese and Bosnians.</P>
      <P>The Government recently agreed a further and final round of visas for family reunification for relatives of Bosnian and Vietnamese refugees already in Ireland.  Under this Government decision, up to 200 Vietnamese and 350 Bosnians will be admitted.  The decision was taken to satisfy the genuine need for family reunification felt in both communities and as part of the process of resettlement and integration.</P>

      <P>The General Affairs Council of 9 November considered the situation arising from Iraq's refusal to allow the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) <Col N="949" /> to carry out its mandate as laid down by the UN Security Council.</P>
      <P>The Council condemned as totally unacceptable Iraq's decision of 31 October to cease all co-operation with UNSCOM.  It supported the Security Council's response to that decision and urged Iraq to resume full co-operation with UNSCOM and the IAEA immediately. The EU welcomed the fact that the Security Council had again expressed its readiness to hold a comprehensive review of Iraq's obligations once Iraq had resumed co-operation.  The EU confirmed its full support for the Secretary General in his efforts to seek full implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding of 23 February 1998.</P>
      <P>The Council made clear the EU's intention to work to ensure more effective implementation of the oil for food programme and full Iraqi co-operation in preventing any unnecessary suffering for the Iraqi people.</P>
      <P>This latest crisis was resolved by undertakings given by Iraq, on 14 and 15 November, to permit UNSCOM inspectors to resume their normal duties.</P>
      <P>I have since noted with concern recent reports that not all the requests which the UNSCOM inspectors have made for documents and access to various buildings are being met as satisfactorily as they would wish.  Following protests by the UN office in Baghdad some of the difficulties have been resolved.  I understand that the Chairman of UNSCOM will be reporting shortly on the overall situation to the Security Council and I await his report with interest.</P>

      <P>Within the Department two committees have been set up to monitor and oversee progress on achieving year 2000 compliance.  One relates to the Department itself and the other to the agencies under the aegis of the Department i.e. National Committee for Development Education, Refugee Agency, Agency for Personal Service Overseas and Irish Aid Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department, in common with other Government Departments, has established a plan to ensure that it is year 2000 compliant by the end of 1999.  This plan covers all IT hardware and software along with other office equipment and plant.  The plan includes the following: an inventory of all hardware and software in the Department, <Col N="950" /> close contact with suppliers, on-site testing and replacement upgrading of any non-compliant hardware or software.  The plan was submitted to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee in December 1997 and updated status reports are submitted to this committee every two months.</P>
    <P>Work to date includes the completion of inventories and the certification of certain systems as year 2000 compliant.  In the context of the Department's quality customer care strategy, the remedial work required for the Passport Office is well under way.  Work to ensure the continuity of internal services such as word processing, e-mail, financial and personnel management systems etc., is progressing.</P>
    <P>Progress on the implementation of the plan is being closely monitored in conjunction with the year 2000 monitoring committee to ensure that the necessary work will be completed in good time.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,325,000 has been included in this year's Departmental estimates for year 2000 related work in 1999.</P>
    <P>To date no additional staff have been assigned and no consultants have been engaged to assist this Department's year 2000 project.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 139, 141, 143, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the information currently available, official development assistance (ODA) in 1999 is expected to be in the region of £153 million.</P>
      <P>This will be the largest ever allocation for Irish ODA.  The figure for 1998 was £137 million.  As recently as 1992, the comparable figure was only £40 million.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, the increase in the period 1992-9 is expected to be from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent.</P>
      <P>These figures indicate significant progress in a short number of years.  At the same time, I recognise that much remains to be done in terms of making further progress towards our interim target of 0.45 per cent and the ultimate United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as ODA.</P>
      <P>A valuable recent innovation is the adoption, in addition to the GNP targets, of specific commitments to guaranteed minimum amounts for three years in advance for certain core elements of the programme, including emergency humanitarian assistance, rehabilitation assistance, cofinancing of projects implemented by non governmental organisations (NGOs), bilateral aid to priority countries, the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) and voluntary contributions to UN agencies.  On this basis, there is a guarantee of substantial additional resources for the programmes concerned over the period to 2001, thereby facilitating more effective planning of aid activities.</P>
      <P>The principal beneficiary countries arising from the Irish Aid programme are the priority countries for Irish bilateral assistance: Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia. Full details of expenditure are published in the Irish Aid annual report.</P>
      <P>In relation to the volume of multilateral and bilateral ODA, the allocations in 1998 were £88.6 million for bilateral aid and £46.0 million for multilateral aid, including mandatory assessments as well as voluntary contributions.  The corresponding figures for 1997 were £78.9 million and £39.1 million respectively.  The details in respect of 1999 are not yet available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The key position of foreign policy issues within the European Union is underlined by the status which the common foreign and security policy, <Col N="952" /> CFSP, enjoys as a distinct and separate pillar of the Union's activities.  As set out in Article J.1.1. of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the objectives of the CFSP, <i>inter alia</i>, are to safeguard the common values and interests of the Union; to strengthen the security of the Union; to preserve peace and strengthen international security; to promote international co-operation; and to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Ireland's input into the development of the common foreign and security policy is considerable. In addition to our day to day input into a wide variety of issues, our attention is in particular focused on those aspects of the CFSP which arise in the context of the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam which is expected to come into force next year.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty provides for a revision and systemisation of decision-making under the CFSP.  The role of the European Council in defining principles and general guidelines, which was already provided for in the Treaty of Maastricht, will be highlighted to a greater extent.</P>
      <P>Under the new Treaty of Amsterdam provisions, the European Council will decide on &ldquo;Common Strategies&rdquo; in selected areas where the member states have important interests in common and the General Affairs Council will recommend and implement such strategies.  Treaty provisions allow for decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy to be adopted by majority vote, subject to safeguards, the so-called &ldquo;emergency brake&rdquo;.  It is envisaged that a Common Strategy will be adopted by the European Council by unanimity in the customary way, and that it will provide a more or less detailed outline of policy objectives on the basis of which subsequent implementing decisions could be adopted.</P>
      <P>Discussions have taken place recently at senior official level among partners regarding a list of topics for the first common strategies.  Arising from these discussions, the General Affairs Council, on 7 December, approved a list of topics to be submitted to the Vienna European Council, for the first Common Strategies to be adopted under the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Work on these topics will commence under the forthcoming German Presidency.  Ireland has participated in and contributed to these discussions, both at official level and at the General Affairs Council and European Council.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty also provides for two related institutional changes to the operation of the CFSP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Representative-Secretary General of the Council, Mr. -Ms CFSP, will have responsibility for assisting the Presidency in representing the Union on CFSP issues and contributing to policy formulation.  The Cardiff European Council in June decided to appoint the High Representative at the Vienna European Council in December.  The consensus is that the High Representative will have a political rather than civil service background.  However, as several partners <Col N="953" /> felt that the matter was not yet ripe for agreement, the decision regarding the appointment has been postponed, probably until the Cologne European Council.  Ireland has participated fully in the discussions to date regarding this important appointment and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty provides for the establishement of the Policy Planning and Early Warning Unit &mdash; PPEWU.  The purpose of the new unit will be to provide the Presidency and the Council with timely assessments of situations and to produce argued policy option papers to be presented by the Presidency to the Council as a contribution to policy formulation.  The Western European Union Secretariat will have a presence in this unit.  Ireland has been involved in the discussions on the preparations for the establishment of the unit.</P>

      <P>I believe the various refugee support projects referred to by the Deputy have been generally successful.  Of course, some projects, such as the English language training for the Vietnamese community, have been in operation for some years and, naturally, have been reviewed.</P>
      <P>In 1996, with the significant growth in numbers of refugees, the Refugee Agency and the Department of Education and Science commissioned a report into English language training for refugees generally by the Centre for Language and Communications Studies in Trinity College.  The report recommended greater co-ordination and the development of more formal systems including, for adults, the development of teaching materials, measurement of progress and a systematic process for progression from English language into vocational training and employment.</P>
      <P>Following on these recommendations, a refugee language support unit is being established to oversee and further develop all aspects of educational support and English language training for all refugees.  The unit will be funded by the Department of Education and Science and will be managed by Trinity College.  It will subsume the Interact Ireland Project mentioned in my earlier reply of 5 November.  That project, which has been providing special bridging courses for refugees, combining English language training, training in basic computer skills and job search skills, has been very successful.  In operation as a pilot project since 1996, it has assisted over 100 refugees, with 87 per cent of participants progressing to employment or mainstream FÁS courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The Bosnian community development project was established in 1995.  It was funded by FÁS as a community employment scheme providing employment and training for 15 Bosnians to provide social, cultural and community services for the wider Bosnian community in the greater Dublin area.  The Bosnian community development project succeeded in obtaining EU funding, under the Integra programme, from March 1996 to March 1998.  While EU funding has now ended, the project is now very well established and plays a critical role in helping the Bosnian community adjust to life in Ireland.  This role is recognised by ongoing FÁS funding and by funding from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs under their Community Development Programme.</P>
    <P>The Vietnamese Irish Association was established by the Vietnamese community in 1990 and operates a FÁS community employment scheme and also acts as a useful social and cultural support for members of that community.</P>

      <P>When Ireland and China established diplomatic relations in 1979, it was agreed that the Government of the People's Republic of China would be recognised as the sole legal Government of China.  This position, which has been adopted by the great majority of countries, is known as the &lsquo;one China&rsquo; policy.  In keeping with this policy, we do not recognise the claims of the Taiwanese authorities to be the legal Government of China nor do we recognise Taiwan as a separate independent State.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Government does not support the application of Taiwan to be a member of the United Nations nor of any other organisation made up of sovereign independent states.  The Government is nevertheless favourably disposed to the participation of representatives of the people of Taiwan in economic, technical, social, sporting and cultural activities and organisations where non-state entities are eligible to participate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> Assembly of the United Nations in New York last September, I drew attention to this issue and urged the need for international action.  Of particular concern in this regard is the deplorable treatment by the military regime in Rangoon of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in relation to Burma is based on the Common Position adopted by the European Union in October 1996.  This Common Position stressed the Union's profound concern at the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Burma including the restrictions imposed on fundamental rights of freedom such as speech, movement and assembly.  It put in place an arms embargo together with a suspension of non-humanitarian aid or development programmes, imposed various restrictions on the military in Burma and urged the regime to restore democracy without delay and to respect human rights.</P>
    <P>The EU Common Position was renewed for a further six months at the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg on 26 October this year.  It was strengthened by a widening of the visa ban to include transit visas explicitly under the current ban and by an extension of the ban to cover Burmese authorities in the tourism sector.  I have made it clear to our EU partners that Ireland supports a further strengthening and broadening of the sanctions against the Burmese regime by extending the present measures to include restrictions on trade and investment.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to avail of every opportunity to work for an improvement of the human rights situation in Burma and to do all it can to assist the democratic movement in that country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 118, 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement provided for the establishment of an Independent Commission on Policing to make recommendations for future policing arrangements in Northern Ireland, including means of encouraging widespread community support for these arrangements.  In accordance with this commitment, the British Government established a commission under the chairmanship of the former Governor of Hong Kong, Mr. Chris Patten.  What the recommendations of that commission must achieve are clearly set out in the British-Irish Agreement.  As the Agreement states, the commission's proposals should be designed to ensure that policing arrangements, including composition, recruitment, training, culture, ethos and symbols, are such that in a new approach, Northern Ireland has a police service that can enjoy widespread support from, and is seen as an integral part of, the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>In formulating its recommendations, the commission is charged with inquiring into policing in Northern Ireland.  It is currently undertaking a process of wide consultation amongst all interested groups and individuals in Northern Ireland.  I understand that the commission has received a large number of submissions offering a variety of approaches and proposals. Regionalisation and community-style policing are issues which are favoured by some parties.  All the proposals will, I am confident, be reviewed and considered by the commission and its members. They have all added to the debate on policing. However, it would not be appropriate for me to seek to pre-empt the deliberations or the recommendations of the commission.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent statement by the chairman of the commission that he will have access to the reports of the Stalker and Stevens inquiries into the RUC.  It is vitally important that the public has confidence that the commission has fully discharged its obligation to ensure that its recommendations will be based on a full and complete knowledge of policing in Northern Ireland.  The Government continues to monitor the relations between the security forces and the community in Northern Ireland, including the operation of the RUC, and to make representations as appropriate to the British authorities through the frame-work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government set out its views on the need for fundamental changes in policing in Northern Ireland at a meeting between Government <Col N="957" /> officials and the Patten Commission in September. Further meetings between Government officials and commission members are envisaged. If, in addition, we feel that we could further assist the commission in formulating recommendations consistent with the objectives set out in the Agreement, we would be prepared to provide supplementary clarification at the appropriate time.  The real source of detailed proposals remains the views of those who are to be policed under the new structures and arrangements &mdash; the people of Northern Ireland and their political and community leaders.  Their views will greatly help the commission to fulfil its mandate of making recommendations which, in the words of the Agreement, will provide the opportunity for a new beginning to policing in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the IRA have requested help in locating the bodies of the disappeared. There are missing persons on both sides of the community and I again call on all those who have any information which might lead to the identification of their whereabouts to come forward at the earliest possible opportunity.  Over the years, the grief of the relatives has been compounded by the anguish of not knowing the whereabouts of their loved ones.  It is essential that this matter should be resolved at the earliest opportunity.  I believe a resolution of this question would promote healing and reconciliation throughout the island and would have a genuine confidence building effect.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While not setting down decommissioning as a precondition for participation in the Executive, the British-Irish Agreement contains specific and very important provisions on decommissioning. Recalling their agreement that &ldquo;the resolution of the decommissioning issue is an indispensable part of the process of negotiation&rdquo; the participants <Col N="958" /> in the multi-party talks reaffirmed their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.  They also confirmed their intention to work constructively with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, and to use any influence they may have to achieve decommissioning within two years, following endorsement in referendums, North and South, of the Agreement and in the context of the implementation of the overall settlement.  What is above all essential, in the view of the Government, is that all aspects of the Agreement, including its decommissioning section, are implemented in full.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the decision by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to despecify the Loyalist Volunteer Force for the purposes of the programme of early releases provided for in the British-Irish Agreement.  Under the British-Irish Agreement, both Governments are committed to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of qualifying prisoners. This commitment is given effect to in Northern Ireland by the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act which came into force on 28 July 1998.  The Act stipulates that, to qualify for early release, a prisoner must be neither a supporter of a specified organisation nor likely, if released, to become a supporter of such an organisation.</P>
      <P>In announcing her decision in relation to the Loyalist Volunteer Force, the Secretary of State said that she had taken into account all of the factors set out in the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act, 1998, and the security information available to her.  She said that she was satisfied that the Loyalist Volunteer Force had established a complete and unequivocal ceasefire and had demonstrated that the ceasefire was being maintained over a significant period of time.  The Government were advised by the British side of the intentions of the Secretary of State in this matter.</P>

      <P>I have not had any direct contact with the Libyan Government regarding the handover of the suspects in the Lockerbie bombing.  However, the issue of the handover of the suspects arose, in general terms, in discussions which senior officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs had last July with Libyan officials, in the context of the continued application of UN sanctions against Libya.  The Libyan side provided some information about the efforts which were being made <Col N="960" /> to resolve the impasse.  The subject also arose in discussion when the Irish Ambassador to Libya called on the Libyan Foreign Minister on 11 October when the Minister explained the position of his Government in the matter.  I am aware that, since then, there have been a number of developments involving the UN Secretary General, and I underline my support for the efforts which he is making and my hope that these will lead to a satisfactory outcome.</P>

        <i>Facts About Ireland</i> was last published in book form in 1995.  The first CD-ROM version was published in 1996.  A limited revision of the CD-ROM edition was undertaken earlier this year and published at the time of President and Mrs. Clinton's visit to Ireland.  My Department sought and has been allocated additional funds in the 1999 Estimates for the preparation and publication of new editions of <i>Facts About Ireland</i> in CD-ROM and book formats.  The planning for the publication of these has started, but no publication date has yet been fixed.  It is my intention however that both will be published by the end of 1999.  I will ensure that complimentary copies of both book and CD-ROM will be distributed to Members of the Oireachtas when they are published.</P>

      <P>From 12 to 17 August, I visited Kenya and Sudan in connection with the humanitarian emergency in southern Sudan.  The purpose of that visit was to secure access to the hardest hit areas for relief operations and to urge the relevant parties to search for solutions to the underlying political and military causes of the conflict.  It was also an opportunity to see first-hand the worst effects of this devastating famine.  On 11 to 12 February, I attended a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers with their counterparts from the Rio Group of South and Central American countries in Panama City. Discussions focussed on co-operation across a range of fields, including the promotion of enhanced trade and investment between the EU States and Latin America.</P>
      <P>I also, of course, take advantage of other engagements and meetings abroad to discuss development co-operation issues.  As part of my visit to the United Nations last September, for example, I attended a meeting between the Secretary General and Ministers for Foreign Affairs from developed countries to discuss conflict prevention issues in Africa and the role development co-operation can play in this area.</P>

      <P>My Department has had in place for the last two years a programme to deal systematically with this problem.  This is well advanced with the bulk of the remedial work and testing being due for completion by the end of this year and the remainder by early to mid next year.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for my Department contain a provision of £15,000 to deal with the problem in 1999.  This figure reflects the fact that the programme is now almost complete.  In addition, much of the remaining work is being carried out as an integral part of maintenance and project work which would have been undertaken in any event.  There were no additional staff taken on specifically to deal with the year 2000 issue.</P>
      <P>I am monitoring on a regular basis the progress of the State agencies under my aegis in preparing for the year 2000.  I am informed by these agencies that they are satisfied that all their critical systems will be operational in time for 1 January 2000.  The cost of necessary compliance work in the State agencies and the additional staff engaged is an operational matter for the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>There are formal regular reporting procedures on progress in respect of my Department and the State agencies to Government.  I am, therefore, confident in the ability of my Department and the State agencies for which I am responsible to cope adequately with the year 2000 problem.  However, as a matter of prudence, I will be ensuring that appropriate contingency plans are in place.</P>

    <P>I understand that the question of reopening this line was recently examined by CIE.  The conclusion reached was that the necessary investment <Col N="965" /> could not be justified in the short to medium term but that the option should be kept under review in the longer term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative process on aircraft noise in the European Union is based on the noise certification standards laid down in annex 16 to the convention of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, 1944.  An EU directive adopted in 1992 provides for the gradual phaseout between 1 April 1995 and 1 April 2002 of all aircraft which do not meet the noise standards specified in chapter 3 of annex 16.</P>
      <P>The 1992 directive allowed for chapter 2 aircraft to be acoustically modified through the fitting of hushkits to enable these aircraft to meet chapter 3 standards.  The proposed EU regulation refered to by the Deputy aims at limiting the use of hushkitted aircraft which have been recertified as meeting chapter 3 standards principally by providing that from 1 April 1999 hushkitted aircraft cannot be added to the registers of member states.  Hushkitted aircraft are marginal chapter 3 aircraft and with the phasing out of chapter 2 aircraft will be the noisest aircraft types flying.  The proposed regulation is a response to extensive studies carried out by the European Commission on the problem of nuisance caused by aircraft noise.</P>
      <P>I am aware that, at the recent ICAO assembly there were differing views in relation to the proposed EU regulation.  However, it was agreed at the assembly that work in relation to improved noise standards at ICAO level, including the development of standards more stringent than those contained in chapter 3, would be accelerated.</P>
      <P>In regard to the implementation of the proposed EU regulation in Ireland, I am advised by the Irish Aviation Authority that the proposed regulation should not pose difficulties for existing Irish licensed air carriers.</P>
      <P>A common position on the proposed regulation was agreed by Council on 16 November 1998. The co-decision procedure with the European Parliament is being finalised.</P>

A full contact list is provided, including e-mail addresses.  It is, therefore, both possible and easy for any member of the public to directly e-mail the officer who is responsible for the particular issue in which he or she is interested.  It is also easy to make freedom of information requests through the e-mail facility at the site.</P>
      <P>Staff familiarisation and training in the use of information technology is an integral part of the significant training initiative which has been under way in my Department since the commencement of the SMI process.  In addition, staff members from time to time pursue IT related courses under the scheme for refund of third level fees.  I have no plans to grant aid education of third parties in the use of information technology in their day-to-day dealing with my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if references to the condition of the railway track between Athlone and Claremorris contained in the original reports on rail safety in Ireland were brought to her attention; if she discussed safety on this line with representatives from Iarnród Éireann since this report was given to her Department; the specific safety measures, if any, introduced to improve safety on this line; and if she has satisfied herself that all possible measures have been taken on this line to ensure that accidents arising from metal fatigue of the track do not occur.</Quest>

      <P>My primary concern has been to ensure the strategic issues in relation to rail safety are adequately addressed.  It was with that in mind that I commissioned independent consultants to undertake a strategic review of all aspects of rail safety.  Immediately I received the report from the independent consultants, I brought it to Government for consideration.  I then arranged to have it published.  On the day it was published I met the CIE board to discuss the content of the report, to brief it on the Government decisions in relation to it and to seek its support in implementing its recommendations.  A high level task force has been established which will report by end January with prioritised recommendations to address the issues identified in the independent consultants' report.</P>
      <P>It is the responsibility of CIE and Iarnród Éireann to take whatever action they consider necessary to deal with specific safety issues on the rail system.  I have no statutory function in relation to rail safety and it would not be appropriate for me to become involved in the detailed technical findings that the safety consultants made during their sample inspections of individual sections of the rail network.  Consequently details of such findings were not brought to my attention and I have not discussed them with Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>The safety issues identified by the consultants during their inspections were brought to the attention of Iarnród Éireann personnel accompanying the consultants at the time they were discovered.  Subsequently my Department gave copies of each of the consultants' working papers to Iarnród Éireann and, consequently, the company has a record of the issues identified in those documents.  I have already placed a copy of these working papers in the Oireachtas Library. It is a matter for the company to determine what action needs to be taken to deal with the specific safety issues identified by the consultants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, to 156 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>When I became aware that my Department has made comments on, and suggested textual changes to, a draft of the consultants' report, I immediately discussed the matter with senior officials in my Department.  The assistant secretary responsible for public transport, who made the comments and suggested the changes, assured me that the purpose of those comments and suggested changes was to ensure that the report was clear and unambiguous and that it was easily read and accessible.  He also drew my attention to the fact that it has been made clear in writing to the consultants that they were free to accept or reject the suggestions in accordance with their professional judgment.  I accepted those assurances and consequently did not seek a full list of the comments and suggestions made.</P>
      <P>The assistant secretary responsible for public transport subsequently wrote to Deputy Yates on 2 December to confirm that no attempt was made by the Department of Public Enterprise to minimise or dilute any of the findings, conclusions or recommendations of the consultants who carried out the strategic review of rail safety.  I also accept those assurances.  Any changes which the consultants made in relation to sections of the railway were solely based on their own independent professional judgment.</P>
      <P>The consultants identified the need for immediate works costing about £23 million and Iarnród Éireann is dealing with these issues as a matter of urgency.  The immediate works relate to items at particular locations identified by the consultants in the course of their inspections and to generic items that arose throughout the railway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The documents which I have placed in the Oireachtas Library include the draft of the consultants' report containing my Department's comments and suggested amendments, copies of the consultants' working documents which were <Col N="969" /> given to Iarnród Éireann and correspondence with Iarnród Éireann.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd first contacted my Department about this matter on 19 November 1998.  My officials recognised that the Senator would be entitled to the documentation relating to the study under the Freedom of Information Act and immediately set about making them available without requiring the Senator to use the procedures under the Act.  The documents were given to the Senator on 25 November 1998 and I was informed of the matter at that time.</P>
    <P>Later that day Senator O'Dowd raised the matter in the Seanad.  In the course of the Seanad debate I offered to arrange a meeting between Senator O'Dowd and the Secretary General and officials of my Department.  That meeting took place on 2 December, the first convenient date for both parties.  Senator O'Dowd was accompanied by Deputy Ivan Yates and Mr. Mark Kennelly from Deputy John Bruton's office.  The Secretary General was accompanied by the assistant secretary and the principal officer with responsibility for the stuty.  I also asked the Secretary General to arrange a meeting with the consultants.  Senator O'Dowd, Deputy Yates and Mr. Kennelly also met the consultants privately on 2 December.</P>

      <P>In recent years, the Department of Defence and the Defence forces have invested significant resources in upgrading computer systems in the main business areas such as payroll, financial management, inventory management and procurement. While this investment was largely driven by business needs, the opportunity was taken to identify and plan the replacement or upgrading of systems which were not year 2000 compliant.  As a result many of the systems in use are now compliant and the ongoing investment programme will help to ensuer all remaining systems will be compliant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates do not distinguish between the costs of meeting business needs in the broad sense and the costs of achieving year 2000 compliance. It might be of some assistance, however, to mention that out of a total 1999 Estimate of some £6.5 million for IT and telecommunications expenditure for the Department and the Defence Forces, the proportion of this which might be <Col N="970" /> attributed to meeting year 2000 needs solely is about 16 per cent or £1.06 million.</P>
    <P>No additional staff have been taken on and only one small outside consultancy project has been undertaken.</P>

    <P>The society is an autonomous body with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council.

Council meetings are normally held twice a year and I understand a satisfactory <Col N="971" /> and productive meeting was held on Saturday, 5 December 1998.</P>
    <P>The executive committee of the Irish Red Cross Soceity is elected by the members of the central council.

      <P>Defensive equipment is acquired for the Defence Forces in accordance with national procedures relating to public procurement.  Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders which are assessed on the basis of obtaining best value for money by the Department. Invitations to tender provide that the Minister is not bound to accept the lowest or any tender. United Nations and European Union trade embargoes which may be in force from time to time are observed.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the Centre for Management and Organisation Development of the Department of Finance, my Department completed a year 2000 assessment and compliance plan last year.  In August 1997 my Department set up a year 2000 project board, to oversee the work on year 2000 compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the preliminary impact assessment, some 50 departmental systems were identified as being non-compliant.  Remedial work is being carried out on all of these and some tasks have been completed.  The year 2000 project board meets on <Col N="979" /> a monthly basis to review and monitor progress. In addition, a bi-monthly status report is forwarded to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee.  It is expected that work on the non-compliant systems will be completed by mid-1999.</P>
    <P>The headage-premia and export refunds systems are the main payment systems accounting for approximately £1.3 billion of my Department's total annual spend.  Work on the headage and premium systems is at an advanced stage and should be completed by mid-1999.  Year 2000 work has been completed on the export refunds application code.  Systems dealing with REPS and structural improvement measures are also year 2000 compliant.  The estimated cost for my Department's year 2000 compliance work is £1.8 million, of which £820,000 will be spent in 1998.</P>
    <P>With regard to staff assigned to year 2000 work, nine computer staff have been allocated full-time to the year 2000 project since June 1998. Where software applications were developed in-house staff maintaining these systems are carrying out the year 2000 remedial work.  where systems were developed externally consultants have been engaged to make the necessary amendments.</P>
    <P>With regard to State agencies under the aegis of my Department, a separate monitoring group was established to oversee year 2000 compliance in these organisations.  The monitoring group includes representatives of all State agencies. Each agency report to the group on a bi-monthly basis and work is progressing well.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on 37 cows under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme and on 30 cows under the 1998 beef cow headage scheme.  The 1998 area aid shows the person named to have a total of 50.80 hectares; 30.57 hectares in a less severely handicapped area and 20.23 hectares in a non-disadvantaged area.  The calculation of the beef cow grant was based on the 30.57 hectares in the less severely handicapped area which entitled the person named to payment on 18.05 beef cows.</P>
      <P>My Department is prepared to include the other seven animals in the calculation for payment of beef cow headage entitling the person named to an overall payment on 22.26 beef cows. An examination of the payment made to the person named under the 1997 beef cow scheme shows that it was based on 50.8 hectares of less severely handicapped land rather than on the 28.71 hectares of less severely handicapped land which is now shown on his 1997 area aid which was amended on 25 June 1998.  Following a recalculation of his entitlement under the scheme, the person named was overpaid by £724.50 under the 1997 scheme.  Consequently, the balance due of £315.52 under the 1998 beef cow scheme will be offset against this overpayment.</P>
      <P>Payment of the 1996 beef cow grant amounting to £2,250 was based on 43.98 hectares in a less severely handicapped area and my Department is currently checking the position regarding the classification of these lands at that time and will contact the person named directly on the outcome of these enquiries.</P>
      <P>His 1998 area aid application confirms that there is insufficient forage area within the disadvantaged area to justify payment on 30 beef cows, which is the maximum payable under the beef cow headage scheme.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 21 suckler cows under the 1997 small scale suckler cow premium scheme.  He had a total of 27 cows and held a milk quota on 1 April 1997 for 10,544 gallons. Based on the fact that the applicant applied as a small scale milk supplier it required 11.75 livestock units (10,544 gallons divided by the average national yield of 897 gallons per cow) cows to fill the milk quota.  He was paid suckler cow premium on the remaining 15.25 suckler cows.</P>
      <P>Subsequently it was brought to the attention of my Department that the person named applied for the small scale milk suppliers scheme in error and should have applied for the main suckler cow premium scheme.  On checking it was confirmed that the person named is not a milk supplier and is therefore eligible for payment on a total of 21 cows as he has 21 quota rights.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are now being made to have payment issued on 5.75 suckler cows as soon as possible (5.75 being the balance on 21 animals less the 15.25 already paid).</P>
      <P>The forage area credited to this herdowner for 1997 is 18.25 hectares.  The total livestock units (LUs) for 1997 was 32.75 (21 LUs for cows paid + 11.75 LUs required for milk quota held by the herdowner on 1 April 1997 as all milk quota held at this date must be taken into account in calculating stocking density).  To arrive at stocking density figures the total livestock units credited to herdowner is divided by the area of land held .&mdash; in this case this translates as 32.75 ÷ 18.25 = 1.79. Extensification premium is only paid to qualifying producers who have a stocking density of less than 1.4 LU per hectare therefore in this case as the stocking density of the person named is not less than 1.4 LUs per hectare he has no entitlement to extensification premium for 1997.</P>
      <P>This herdowner received an 80 per cent advance payment under the 1998 suckler cow premium scheme on 21 suckler cows amounting to £2,355.86 on 3 November 1998.</P>

      <P>The problem with commonage claims is due to the shareholders cumulatively claiming an area in excess of the gross area of the commonage. Where it is clear that the overclaim is attributable to one or two shareholders they are queried and the area aid applications of the remaining shareholders are cleared.  However, where the shareholders causing the overclaim are not readily identifiable, it is necessary to take the matter up with all the applicant shareholders.</P>

      <P>I recognise the importance of this developing area and the massive potential for improved service delivery that it offers to my Department, which has some 200,000 clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department actively supports the use of the Internet.  The Irish Government's website was established in co-ordination with the Department of Finance.  My Department was one of the first presences on this central site.  Our site has existed since 1996 and has gone through a process of constant development.  The information available on <Col N="991" /> this site ranges from press releases, detailed information on my Department's schemes and services through to the farmers charter and agricultural statistics.  The Net has proved to be an invaluable resource for example, in my Department's response to the BSE crisis we have been able to broadcast our position to key export markets in their own languages.  My Department monitors access to our site and the figures indicate a high degree of usage.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to build on this foundation.</P>
    <P>This presence on the Net has allowed for e-mail access to my Department.  To date, contacts have broadly related to the retrieval of general information. For 1999, it is my intention to intensify this contact by inviting applicants for our headage and premium schemes to supply an e-mail address.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department strongly supports the work of the Information Society Commission and is actively participating in the implementation of its findings.  Indeed, my Department intends to develop a pilot project to allow farmers submit application forms for headage and premium schemes by e-mail.  In the medium term, it should be possible to allow clients to track progress of their individual grant applications from receipt to payment.</P>
    <P>Another area where progress is being made relates to the question of electronic funds transfer, EFT.  My Department's accounting system is in the process of redevelopment and a key aspect of this on completion, will be the availability to each client of EFT.  This will have obvious benefits, not least of which will be the speedier and more secure availability of funds.</P>

In addition it should be noted that all sheep farmers with mountain grazings as per the sheep headage scheme will benefit under the scheme.  A sum of £10 million is being provided for this purpose with a ceiling of £300 per farmer.

      <P>The report of the review group on the national lottery, which was commissioned by the previous Government and published last year, recommended that the surplus revenues of the national lottery, other than those in the reserve fund, should in future be devoted entirely to the support of community and voluntary activity in the <Col N="997" /> area of youth services, sports, the arts, the Irish language, welfare, health and social services, community development, etc.</P>
      <P>The report envisaged that this change would be carried out, initially, on a budget-neutral basis. This change meant transferring to Exchequer funding items, heretofore funded by the lottery, which did not fall under the heading of community and voluntary activity, with an equivalent amount of spending on community and voluntary activity, funded by the Exchequer, being transferred to lottery funding.</P>
      <P>The changes were made in the 1999 Abridged Estimates Volume and are explained in the footnotes to appropriate Votes.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that no change in financial provisions has resulted.  The only change has been the source of funding in a particular Vote for a particular service &mdash; either from lottery funding to Exchequer funding or <i>vice versa.</i></P>

      <Quest>the level of gross income at which a PAYE taxpayer will become liable for the higher rate of income tax in the 1999-2000 tax year for a single person and a married person with one spouse working; the equivalent 1998-9 figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A single taxpayer will become liable for the higher rate of income tax at £14,000 in the 1999-2000 tax year, compared with £13,950 in the 1998-99 tax year. A married couple with one spouse working will become liable to the higher rate of income tax at £28,000 in the 1999-2000 tax year, compared with £27,100 in the 1998-99 tax year.</P>
      <P>In my recent Budget Statement, I announced the standard rating of the basic single and married personal and PAYE allowances and a significant widening of the standard income tax band to offset the effect of standard rating these allowances for higher rate taxpayers.  In addition, I announced a significant increase in the standard rate of personal allowance and PAYE allowance which effectively gives the same cash gain to all taxpayers regardless of their marginal rate of tax. A single PAYE worker will have standard rated personal and PAYE allowances of £5,200 per annum in the 1999-2000 tax year while a married couple with one spouse working will have standard rated allowances totalling £9,400 in the 1999-2000 tax year.</P>
      <P>Deputies should note that, because the main personal allowances and the PAYE allowance are now standard rated, they will no longer count towards the threshold at which taxpayers become liable to the higher rate of tax.  In future, the standard rated personal allowances and PAYE allowances will be deducted after tax is calculated rather than before the tax calculation as was the case up to now.</P>

      <P>The Government is taking an active leadership role in managing the year 2000 problem.  Through directives to the civil and public service and a major business awareness campaign for the private sector, the Government has ensured that the year 2000 problem is being treated with top priority and the utmost urgency.</P>
      <P>Given the diversity of systems and equipment and associated issues across the various sectors, the Government has adopted the approach of focusing on the year 2000 problem at a sectoral level.</P>
      <P>The Government has made each Department and office individually responsible for ensuring it achieves year 2000 compliance in good time.  The Government also made each Department individually responsible for ensuring the achievement of year 2000 compliance in all agencies operating under its aegis.  The Government co-ordinates six reporting streams covering the civil and public service, based on the following monitoring and reporting structures.</P>
      <P>Based on a detailed circular and advice note provided by my Department, all Departments and offices have put comprehensive year 2000 programmes in place.  Remedial work has been ongoing since 1996.  The Government has instructed senior management to take a personal interest in overseeing this year 2000 compliance work, and each Department and office has established an internal monitoring committee, chaired by a senior manager, which reports to its senior management and Minister regularly on the progress it is making.</P>
      <P>The Government also established an Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committee &mdash; with private sector representation &mdash; in 1997, to oversee the achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment across the Civil Service.  My Department provides the chair and secretariat for this committee.  The committee levies status updates on each Department and office; seeks self-assessments of year 2000 programmes from chairpersons of Departmental Y2K monitoring committees; and interviews Y2K programme managers on their work programmes. Based on this process, the committee reports every two months to me and the Government on the progress being achieved.  The committee has reported on five occasions to date.  While a lot of work remains to be done, reasonable progress is being made and all Departments and offices are satisifed that they will achieve full compliance in good time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Department which has public bodies operating under its ageis has, on the instructions of the Government, set up a monitoring committee, <Col N="999" /> again chaired by a senior manager, to oversee the implementation of year 2000 compliance programmes in these bodies.  These committees report to their senior management and Minister regularly on the progress being made by the public bodies.</P>
    <P>Five Departments, Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Public Enterprise, report, through their Minister, on progress in these sectors to Government every two months.</P>
    <P>The Government has made it clear that private sector companies are also individually responsible for ensuring that they achieve compliance in good time.  To this end, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on the approval of Government, set up a comprehensive business awareness campaign to raise awareness of the problem and provide guidance on solving it to the private sector.  In that regard, it established a year 2000 campaign committee, chaired by the Minister for Science, Technology and Commerce, Deputy Treacy, and enlisted representatives from a wide range of businesses and business development agencies.  To date, this committee has produced a comprehensive guidance brochure, covering planning, remedial work, testing, contingency, director liability, insurance exclusion clauses, audit disclosure requirements and credit requirements, which was issued to approximately 150,000 businesses through various channels; held seven regional information seminars and a national conference addressed by year 2000 experts; contributed to the production of a TV programme and video on the subject; sponsored an ongoing data-gathering project conducted by the Irish Computer Society on the state of readiness of Irish business for the year 2000; and instructed the national enterprise development agencies, Forbairt Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta, to ensure that all their clients, both indigenous and international, are year 2000 compliant. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is currently considering a number of other awareness and guidance initiatives.</P>

      <P>For well over a year now my Department and the offices under its remit have been preparing for the year 2000, in line with formal plans drawn up in 1997. Those plans quantified the effort involved in <Col N="1000" /> achieving year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other affected areas and recent reports show that reasonable progress is being made on their implementation, ensuring that these systems will continue to function properly in the lead up to and after 1 January 2000.  This work is being monitored closely in my own Department by a year 2000 committee, which reports to me.  Similar committees, reporting to senior management, monitor progress in the offices under my remit and these offices report in turn to the Interdepartmental Year 2000 Monitoring Committe, which was established last year to oversee achievement of year 2000 compliance in the Civil Service.  This committee, which is chaired by my Department, reports to Government every two months.</P>
      <P>With regard to costs, it is not possible to say what money is contained in this year's departmental Estimates for dealing with year 2000 problem, because of the element of compliance which is being achieved through the Departments' and offices' ongoing programmes of hardware and software upgrades.  No additional staff have been taken on to assist with this work.  In 1996 the Revenue Commissioners engaged external consultants to work on a short-term joint project with Revenue personnel to assess the impact of year 2000 on Revenue's computer systems and to establish the direction the organisation should take in addressing the problem.  Apart from this no outside consultants have been retained to handle year 2000 remedial work exclusively, but on a number of IT projects on which consultants have been retained, year 2000 compliance is being acheived as part of the overall design objectives. These include the redesign of the Paymaster General Office's payable order reconciliation system in my own Department, the redesign of the recruitment management system in the Civil Service Commission and the introduction of the consolidated tax project and stamp duty administration system in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>A separate committee, which also reports to me, monitors progress on achievement of year 2000 compliance in the State sponsored bodies under tha aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>The recent report of this committee showed that all the bodies have remedial programmes in hand which will achieve compliance on schedule.</P>

      <P>In my Budget Statement I said that I propose to cut the 10 per cent off-course betting tax to 5 per cent with effect from 1 July 1999 and that the Minister for Agriculture and Food will arrange with the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon to eliminate the present on-course levy of 5 per cent to zero with effect from the same date.</P>
      <P>Both proposals are absolutely conditional on satisfactory alternative arrangements being found to secure independent sources of funding for the Irish Horseracing Authority and Bord na gCon from the various elements of both industries, namely, bookmakers, racecourse owners, the Turf Club and others.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, to appoint an independent facilitator to bring the matter of the funding of these two bodies, including amending legislation, if necessary, to a satisfactory conclusion by 1 July 1999.</P>
      <P>This reduction in betting tax will cost the Exchequer approximately £12 million in 1999 and £24 million in a full year.  In 1997, the betting levy income for the Irish Horseracing Authority amounted to £4.4 million; in the same year, the betting levy income for Bord na gCon amounted to £1 million.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that they have copies of the publications referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In my reply to a number of parliamentary questions asked on the topic of charities on 17th November 1998, I explained in some detail the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners operate controls and monitor bodies granted charitable exemption. These include the requirement that bodies granted tax exemption as a charity keep annual accounts which must be made available on request. In all cases, accounts are required to be submitted in respect of the first year of activity of an entity granted exemption.  Bodies with income in excess of £20,000 must submit audited accounts.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the existing arrangements provide a proper balance in meeting Revenue's needs and ensuring that the requirements do not cause undue difficulty for charitably exempt bodies and they do not see a need to make publications of the kind referred to by the Deputy available.</P>

    <P>In addition, local authorities spend a considerable amount from their own resources on house construction. In 1999, this will amount to £67.5 million, bringing total capital spending on housing next year to £227.246 million.</P>
    <P>I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the &ldquo;Summary of 1999 Budget Measures&rdquo;, page 27 of which sets out details of housing initiatives in the coming year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the coming year, the capital allocation for local authority and social housing will increase by £28 million to £237 million.  This increase will finance an additional 600 &ldquo;starts&rdquo; bringing the total to 4,500; a continuation of the redevelopment of Ballymun; the first year of a five year programme to redevelop deprived areas in inner city Dublin; a £2 million increase in the allocation for hostels for the homeless.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In a recent article in IMPACT News the Taoiseach spoke about the need for a new approach to public service pay in the period beyond Partnership 2000.  Public service pay is an area of concern to the entire Government and to myself in particular. There are two basic issues behind the desire for a new system of public service pay determination. First, the need to get away from the old approach of leap-frogging pay claims and, second, the need for pay to more closely reflect performance.</P>
      <P>We have seen the effects of the old approach over the last year.  Pay increases achieved by one group of public service workers became the target increase for other groups on the basis of past relativities or perceived relativities.  The pursuit of comparable increases by certain groups was in disregard of the agreed terms of national pay agreements.  The use of industrial action was a regrettable feature in a number of cases.</P>
      <P>The effect of this system has been a major contributory factor to the substantial increases in the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill in recent years. The Pay and Pensions Bill increased by over 10 per cent in 1997 and will increase by 9 per cent in 1998.  As public service pay and pensions account for around half of current supply expenditure, such increases put pressure on current public expenditure targets.  Any new system of pay determination must recognise the limits on public spending within which the Government must operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any new pay determination system must also support the culture of service to the public and <Col N="1006" /> the focus on improving service and performance which is part of the strategic management initiative across the public service.  We wish to explore how new public service pay arrangements can meet the aspirations of staff while maintaining the unavoidable limits on public spending as well as delivering the level of service and performance which public service management and public service customers demand.</P>
    <P>I expect discussions with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on a new approach to public service pay in the period beyond Partnership 2000 to begin shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 271 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry in relation to the new vehicle registration tax rates and effective date. Representatives of the society met with senior officials of my Department on Thursday, 10 December 1998 and I was briefed on the discussions which took place.  It has been made clear to SIMI that it is not proposed to make any changes to the budget day announcement.</P>
      <P>As I said in the House on budget day, the restructuring of the VRT and the increase in the rates will bring in an estimated £43 million in extra revenue in a full year.</P>
      <P>I believe that the overall package of measures announced in my budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the motor industry, which has been experiencing considerable growth in car sales.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the VRT figures for 1998 to date show that 57 per cent of new car sales are in the up to 1,400cc bracket.  These sales are not affected by the budget announcement.  A further 30 per cent of new car sales are in the 1,401 to 2,000cc bracket. These face a price rise of 3.3 per cent.  Only 4 per cent are in the 2,001 + cc bracket which face a price rise up to 10.7 per cent.  Most manufacturers have models below 1,600ccs, exceptions being manufacturers of luxury and sports car marques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the administration of the vehicle registration tax, that the average increase in VRT in respect of 1,600cc <Col N="1007" /> motor cars is in the region of £468 which, given the lower rates of interest for borrowers, could not be deemed excessive in the context of the overall price of a new motor car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 269, 270, 272, and 273 together.</P>
      <P>The changes which I announced in vehicle registration tax rates on motor cars will yield £43 million in extra revenue and will apply with effect from 1 January 1999.  The changes will affect only those motor cars which are in excess of 1,400 ccs.  The new structure will favour smaller cars by raising the VRT rate on larger cars.  Cars of over 2,000 ccs, the market share of which to date in 1998 is in the region of 4 per cent, will pay the new highest rate of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>As I also said, it is appropriate to recoup revenue in this way from a sector experiencing record sales, which are being underpinned by the rapid economic growth that the country is experiencing. The increases in VRT will also yield a contribution from the motoring sector to meet the additional road-use and environmental damage arising from the unprecedented growth in private car numbers and usage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that in moving the resolution on VRT on budget night the Taoiseach stated that the changes proposed were not solely intended as a revenue raising measure.  He stated that they were a first response to the undoubted environmental impact of motoring in terms of air pollution, congestion and fuel consumption.</P>
      <P>The overall package of measures announced in my budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax, will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the motor industry, which has been experiencing considerable growth in car sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> I inform the Deputy that the VRT figures for 1998 to date show that 57 per cent of new car sales are in the up to 1,400 cc bracket.  These sales are not affected by the budget announcement.  A further 39 per cent of new car sales are in the 1,401 to 2,000 cc bracket.  These face a price rise of 3.3 per cent.  Only 4 per cent are in the 2,001 plus cc bracket which face a price rise up to 10.7 per cent.  Most manufacturers have models below 1,600 ccs, exceptions being manufacturers of luxury and sports car marques.</P>

      <Quest>the revenue from stamp duty raised from house sales in Dublin city and county for each of the years 1997 and 1998; and the projected revenue in this regard for 1999.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the data is not broken down so as to distinguish between house sales and sales of other property and between sales in Dublin city and county and sales in other local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> However, data on the amount of stamp duty collected in respect of transfers and leases of all property is available.  In 1997 the yield was £254.4 million.  The projected outturn for 1998 is £300 million and the projected yield for 1999 is £355 million.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have estimated in the past that approximately 60 per cent of the yield came from transfers and leases of residential property.  However, as sufficient data is not yet available it is not possible to say whether the same percentage would apply to the projected outturn for 1998.</P>

      <P>I have not yet received approval from the EU Commission for the new urban renewal scheme.  The latest position is that the Commission has written to us with several queries arising from our initial application.  The reply to them is currently being prepared.  I stress that this is part of the normal process associated with obtaining EU approval and that the procedure may take some time to complete.</P>
      <P>Any final decision made by the Commission in this context will be announced at the appropriate time.</P>

      <Quest>the proportion of the £40 million in the budget for the year 2000 problem to be utilised by Government Departments; the purpose for which these moneys will be used; and if private companies will be able to apply to his Department for assistance to deal with modification of equipment to cope with the problem.</Quest>

      <P>The Government has been actively addressing the year 2000 problem which can arise with computers and other equipment, and receives regular reports on the progress being made in achieving compliance.  However, there is no precedent for the year 2000 problem and it is widely recognised that it is difficult to anticipate exactly what remedial action will be necessary and the total costs involved.  The approach being taken is to provide a contingency sum of £40 million which has not yet been allocated to individual Departments or offices.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the contingency sum is to provide for necessary expenditure by Departments or offices, to the extent that it cannot be met from normal allocations to modify or replace any computer or other electronic equipment which would malfunction because it could not cope with dates after the end of 1999.  The contingency provision is entirely for use by the public service and is not available to private companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my Budget Statement on 2 December 1998, the Government is conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system. The question of child care tax relief raises important and complex issues.  There is the question of equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional childcare expenses when they go out to work.  There is also a need for a balanced treatment of those who are in the tax system and those who rely on social welfare benefits and for finding the right balance between measures to help towards the cost of child care and measures to improve the supply and quality of child care facilities to meet the growing demand.</P>
      <P>The Government has discussed this area in some detail and proposes to examine the matter further.  In doing so, it will take into consideration the recommendations of the partnership 2000 working group on child care which has not yet finalised its report.</P>
      <P>As a means of facilitating and encouraging the supply of child care facilities, the Government has decided that the provision of cre che facilities by employers will not be subject to a charge to income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind. Furthermore, the Finance Bill will also provide for capital allowances to allow for the write off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.  This capital allowances regime will also extend to providers of child care services generally in the community.</P>
      <P>Those with children will also be helped by increases in child benefit which I also announced in my Budget Statement.</P>
      <P>This is a complex and sensitive area which, as I have already stated, the Government wishes to examine further, taking into account the results of the various major studies already completed and still ongoing.  I do not expect to be introducing any major new initiatives in the Finance Bill over and above those announced in my Budget Statement.</P>

      <P>I believe that the overall package of measures announced in my budget, particularly in relation to income tax and corporation tax will help to stimulate growth in employment in all sectors, including that of the motor industry, which has been experiencing considerable growth in car sales.</P>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the VRT figures for 1998 to date show that 57 per cent of new car sales are in the up to 1,400 cc bracket.  These sales are not affected by the budget announcement.  A further 39 per cent of new car sales are in the 1,401 to 2,000 cc bracket.  These face a price rise of 3.3 per cent. Only 4 per cent are in the 2,001 plus cc bracket which face a price rise up to 10.7 per cent.  Most manufacturers have models below 1,600 ccs, exceptions being manufacturers of luxury and sports car marques.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for the administration of the vehicle registration tax, that the average increase in VRT in respect of 1,600 cc motor cars is in the region of £468 which, given the low rates of interest for borrowers, could not be deemed excessive in the context of the overall price of a new motor car.</P>
      <P>I do not see the changes to VRT having the effect on employment which the Deputy seems to fear.</P>

      <P>The provision of health care units in County Cavan is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the North-Eastern Health Board that its pre-tender procedure for the Cootehill development will commence in mid-January 1999 and should be completed in approximately six weeks.  On its completion tender documentation will issue to short-listed contractors. The tender process normally takes about four weeks with a further two weeks to assess tenders and yet a further two weeks for the completion of bonds, etc.  Based on the foregoing contractual arrangements should be completed by the end of April 1999.  The board further informs me that it is not possible, at this time, to estimate the actual starting date for constuction.</P>
      <P>The issuing of the tender documentation is contingent on funding arrangements being in place.  I have recently made a grant of £65,000 available for the initial costs of this development.  Further financial support from my Department for this development will be considered in 1999 in the context of priority which the North-Eastern Health Board attaches to it, the available capital resources and the competing demands on those resources.</P>

      <P>My Department has been working on the year 2000 aspects of its internal systems in parallel with normal developments since early 1997 and current indications are that compliance will be achieved in good time.  My Department has a year monitoring committee in place, chaired by an assistant secretary, to oversee the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> I have a major programme in place to ensure year 2000 readiness in the agencies under my aegis.  The main elements of this programme are creation of awareness, facilitating co-ordination and sharing of resources and information, provision of limited on the ground assistance to agencies and monitoring progress.  Year 2000 guidelines have been issued setting out a recommended approach to dealing with the problem and a number of seminars have been organised for managers and technical specialists.  Six special interest groups have been set up covering different aspects of the year 2000 problem where remedial action may be required.  My Department is monitoring progress on a monthly basis for larger agencies and two monthly for smaller agencies. This programme is being directed and monitored by a committee chaired by an assistant secretary and I am reporting progress to Government every two months.</P>
    <P>My Department has been allocated £14 million for IT projects in 1999 and it is anticipated that a large proportion of this will be spent resolving potential year 2000 problems.  In addition, a total of £10 million for replacement equipment has recently been allocated to health agencies in the letters of determination and the Minister for Finance has set aside a contingency fund of £40 million for dealing with the year 2000 problem which it will be possible to call upon, if it proves necessary.</P>
    <P>Year 2000 remediation work for the systems within my Department is being undertaken as part of the normal work with a small input from IT companies specialising in year 2000 remediation. I have reassigned two officers within my Department on a full-time basis to co-ordinate the year 2000 programme for the agencies under my aegis.  Assistance has also been provided to my Department by a major Dublin hospital and other health agencies, mainly in the area of medical equipment.</P>

      <P>The funding of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, such as the day resource centre mentioned by the Deputies, is a matter for the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996 sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including day care/resource services.  As recommended in the report, regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services, on which the voluntary agencies and people with disabilities are represented, have been put in place in each of the health boards.  One of the primary functions of the co-ordinating committees is to advise health boards on priorities for the allocation of funds available for the development of the services.  The Southern Health Board is aware of the proposal to build a new premises for the day resource service at Mayfield in Cork.  A capital grant for this project is one of the items which will be discussed by the Southern Health Board co-ordinating committee in the context of the allocation of capital funding in 1999.</P>

    <P>In 1998 a total of £12.4 million was provided for the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities of which £3 million was for the development of services.  In 1999 a total of £9.4 million revenue &mdash; £12.4 million in a full year in the year 2000 &mdash; and £4 million capital is being provided for these services of which £3 million is for development. <Col N="1026" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 295, 296 and 298 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Government's policy in relation to services for people with disabilities is to provide the supports necessary to enable <Col N="1027" /> them to live in the community with the maximum degree of independence possible for each individual. In line with the recommendations of the report, Towards an Independent Future, this involves the provision of a range of services, including respite care, day care, therapy services and home supports, including personal assistance services.  I am aware that all these services are in need of further development.  The objective of policy is to develop the range of services as a whole in accordance with the availability of funding.</P>
    <P>In 1998 additional funding totalling £12.4 million was provided for services specifically for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  Of this, £3 million was for the development of the services.  In 1999 a total of £13.4 million is being provided of which £3 million is for development. As recommended in the report, it is a matter for each health board to decide, in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services, on priorities for the allocation of this funding in its functional area. The development of personal assistance services is one of the priority areas to be considered in this process.</P>
    <P>Personal assistance services are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, funded by the Eastern Health Board and by the Centre for Independent Living through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some difficulties are being experienced in the operation of the personal assistance scheme run by the Irish Wheelchair Association in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board.  One of the difficulties is in recruiting and retaining persons to act as personal assistants.  It has been represented to me that this is due, in part, to the relatively low level of remuneration being paid to personal assistants by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Following discussion with officials of my Department with the Eastern Health Board, I have decided to allocate additional funding to the board in 1999 to enable this issue to be addressed.</P>

Proposals to increase <Col N="1028" /> funding to such organisations should be discussed with the relevant health board.  I understand that the Eastern Health Board allocated funding in 1998 to the IASBH and Muscular Dystrophy Ireland for a joint family support worker pilot project.  The project will be evaluated by the board early next year.</P>

      <P>The Dublin EUROCAT register of congenital anomalies has been collecting data on children born with Spina Bifida/Hydrocephalus and related neural tube defects in the Eastern Health Board area since 1980.  During the 18 year period 1980-1997, there has been a downward trend in the number of NTD births to teenage single mothers, this corresponds to the overall downward trend among mothers of all ages during the same period.  Data from the EUROCAT register shows that 12 children with NTD were born to teenage single mothers during the ten-year period 1988-97.  Only one of these cases occurred after 1993.</P>

      <P>I have allocated a total of £20 million in 1999 to reduce waiting lists and waiting times significantly. The figure allocated in 1998 for this purpose was £12 million, to which I added a further £8 million for waiting list work in 1999.  This total figure of £20 million for 1999 represents a 66 per cent increase over the funding available in 1998, and is 2.5 times higher than the amount allocated in 1997 by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have allocated a total of £11 million to developments in sectors of the health services outside of the acute hospital sector which are of particular importance to implementing the <Col N="1030" /> recommendations of the Review Group on the Waiting List Initiative.  The report recommended a range of steps to free up acute hospital facilities for more elective work.  It pointed out that a significant proportion of acute hospital beds were being inappropriately used by patients who did not need, or who no longer needed, acute hospital care.  This problem arises due to a shortage of places in the areas of &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; or convalescent care, rehabilitation facilities and community-based services which reduce the need to use acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>The £11 million that I have allocated with these issues in mind comprises £9 million for services for older people and £2 million for accident and emergency services.  It will be allocated to such areas as community nursing units, community supports, home help services and the subvention of nursing homes, all of which have a part to play in reducing pressures on acute hospital facilities.</P>

      <P>Since July 1996, the Western Health Board has provided funding on an ongoing basis to the resident general practitioner on the Aran Islands to meet the cost of employing an assistent GP.  That funding will continue into 1999.  Both the GP and the assistant, who was recruited, live on the islands.  The employment of the assistant allows a <Col N="1031" /> one-day weekly service to be provided to Inis Oírr.  However, I should add that for reasons other than funding the assistant was not employed in the period July 18-November 1998 and during that period the service to Inis Oírr was one-day each fortnight alternating with Inis Meáin.</P>
      <P>The board has stated that it is satisfied that an excellent service is being provided by the resident GP and her assistant, particularly having regard to the difficulties and demands associated with the operation of a medical practice in an island environment.</P>
      <P>The board has no plans at present to provide a day care centre on Inis Oírr.  It understands, however, that local groups may be considering making a proposal in that regard.  Should such a proposal be received, the board will give it due consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 306, 307 and 308 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to homelessness as it affects children and young people. The nature and extent of the problem of homeless young people varies between health boards and between community care areas.  Because of the transient nature of the problem and the transient lifestyle of some young people it is difficult to estimate the number of homeless young people throughout Ireland and in particular on a county by county basis.  However, it is recognised that the problem is most acute in the Eastern Health Board region.  On average 12 young people per night present to the social work service operating outside normal office hours and the Eastern <Col N="1032" /> Health Board estimates that 400 young people are out of home in the region each year.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, and up to the end of 1997, and additional allocation of £43.5 million revenue on an annualised basis has been invested in the development of child care and family support services including services for the young homeless. A further £8 million has been made available for this purpose in 1998 and £13 million will be made available in 1999.</P>
    <P>A special allocation of £2 million was made available to the Eastern Health Board in late 1997 for the provision of emergency accommodation, a crisis intervention centre and a reception centre where young people can go for assistance, food and shelter.  These facilities will be opening shortly.</P>
    <P>Young people who find themselves out of home have often experienced a long process of social exclusion.  Many have experienced personal and family problems, alcohol or drug problems, behavioural problems or a combination of these factors.  Often they will have dropped out of the school system.</P>
    <P>In general when homeless young people come to the attention of a health board, every effort is made to reunite them with their family or to arrange to have them placed in foster care or residential care as appropriate.  Social work support, advice, information and counselling to include counselling for families and individuals is offered.</P>
    <P>Because homelessness is a process, the best intervention is early intervention.  At health board level an integrated range of measures is being developed to prevent problems such as homelessness arising in the first place.  These include: early intervention to prevent children and young people at risk from becoming homeless, including family support work and 12 pilot family support projects which are approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Exclusion and funded by the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund; greater provision of services for families and young people in the community, including neighbourhood youth projects and family centres; provision of suitable and varied accommodation and back up services for the young homeless; and accommodation and support services for children leaving care.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to addressing social exclusion in the context of Partnership 2000 and the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The establishement of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, which is chaired by the Taoiseach, reflects the Government's commitment to this issue and provides the opportunity to deal with the relevant issues in a holistic manner by co-ordinating the actions of the relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>A Forum on Youth Homelessness has been established in the Eastern Health Board region with representation from the key voluntary organisations, Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board.  Its purpose is to agree the parameters <Col N="1033" /> of the problem and to agree a way forward.</P>

      <P>The provision of renal dialysis at Waterford Regional Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  A new dialysis unit was opened there in March 1997, catering for 32 patients per week as part of the major capital development at the hospital. Additional funding of £200,000 was subsequently provided in 1998 to enable the hospital to provide a service to further patients that required dialysis as demand for the service grew.  As a result, a total of 42 patients are now attending the unit each week.</P>
      <P>I am aware that further demand for access to this service exists and my Department will continue to work with the South-Eastern Health Board in identifying and addressing the board's overall service development needs.  In this regard, expansion of dialysis services will continue to be considered in the context of the board's competing priorities.</P>

      <P>My Department, through the health promotion unit, has been involved in a number of initiatives in order to improve the incidence of breastfeeding in Ireland including the production of materials encouraging breastfeeding.  The National University of Ireland, Galway, with funding from the health promotion unit, has produced a training pack for health professionals which includes a breastfeeding video and information booklets.  This pack has been developed by the Centre for Health Promotion Studies, National University of Ireland, Galway, in conjunction with the health promotion unit and An Bord Altranais and is designed to equip health professionals with the necessary skills and knowledge to assist mothers in breastfeeding.  It is recognised that the support of health professionals is critical to the success of the national breastfeeding policy as they are the first point of contact for the mother during pregnancy and after childbirth and are ideally placed to ensure that the mother receives information about the benefits of breastfeeding in order that she can make an informed choice.  I have asked that a copy of the materials be made available to all maternity hospitals in the country.</P>
      <P>The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which is a global campaign lead by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF to encourage hospitals and health workers to support mothers to breastfeed, has been recently established in</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have received the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and I gave copies to representatives of the board of management of the hospital on 9 December 1998.  The Deputy will also be aware that I am today placing copies of the report in the Library and have arranged for a copy to be given directly to him.</P>
      <P>The report refers to many criticisms of financial management at the hospital including the absence of audited accounts for 1997.  The criticisms include &ldquo;a lack of awareness throughout the organisation of the financial implications of spending decisions.  Furthermore, no formal process exists to make managers accountable for the financial implications of decisions they are making&rdquo;&mdash; page 33.  The report does point out that the budgetary control systems in place in the new hospital essentially derive from the base hospitals where a system of centralised budgetary control &ldquo;commonly found in other hospitals of their size, was used&rdquo;.  Deloitte &amp; Touche specify in the report the requirements for the development of a comprehensive budgetary control system.</P>
      <P>The report also states that the new financial system needs to be implemented.  It is noted in the report that the hospital plans to introduce this system fully by January 1999.  The report states that &ldquo;It is absolutely essential that the new financial system is implemented in the new hospital as soon as possible to provide reliable, meaningful information to managers on a timely basis.&rdquo; It also states that the consolidation of the personnel/payroll systems into one system is urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With reference to controls, the report states that it is important that a review be carried out of internal control procedures in the hospital to assess their adequacy and operation in the new environment; a financial procedures manual be drawn up; the current vacancy in the internal audit function be filled as soon as possible, and a comprehensive programme of internal audit work be drawn up; staff briefings take place on the <Col N="1036" /> manner in which financial control procedures are to apply.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the report confirms a total projected overrun by the hospital for 1998 of <i>circa</i> £17.5 million.  This is made up of £13.2 million revenue overspend and a potential £4.3 million overrun of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I stated in the House last week, the projected net revenue deficit for 1998 is <i>circa</i> £8.5 million following adjustment, in the normal way, in regard to the hospital's claim for additional funding such as for increased pension costs, special pay awards, PRSI and superannuation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the capital expenditure is currently being reviewed to establish if it was of a critical nature and absolutely essential to the opening of the hospital.  I will consider whether any further capital funding is appropriate when I receive this assessment before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Again as I stated in this House on 10 December, I informed the board of management of the hospital that I will not be funding the remaining £8.5 million revenue deficit, the funding of which is a matter for the board.  I am adopting the same policy with this hospital as I have taken throughout the year with all other hospitals.  How the Tallaght board of management propose to fund the deficit will be one of the important issues to be addressed in its formal response to me and the Department, which I have been informed by the chairman I will receive on Thursday next.</P>

The illnesses covered by this scheme are; mental handicap, mental illness of persons under 16 years, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism and acute leukaemia.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I recently announced the merger of the DCSS and DRS schemes into a new drugs payment scheme to come into effect on 1 March 1999.  Under the new scheme, no family or individual will have to pay more than £42 per month for prescribed medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner <Col N="1038" /> fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In determining eligibility, the local health board will have regard to the financial circumstances of the applicant.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to dicide.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of hospital appointments is solely a matter for the relevant hospital personnel to determine, based upon clinical priority.  Therefore, I have asked the chief executive officer at the hospital concerned to reply to the Deputy in this regard as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative was launched in June 1993.  Its purpose is to reduce waiting times in target specialties to no longer than 12 months for adults and six months for children.  To this end, it channels dedicated funding to selected specialties and hospitals.  A total of £70 million was spent on the waiting list initiative between 1993 and 1998 and a further £20 million has been allocated for 1999.  This brings the total allocated for a dedicated stream of waiting list funding to £90 million since 1993.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1997, approximately 85,000 patients had benefited from the waiting list initiative in target specialties, including ear, nose and throat procedures, incorporating tonsillectomies.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that a further 15,000 procedures will be carried out this year across the target specialties, using funding of £12 million from the waiting list initiative, bringing the total number benefiting to some 100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review group on the waiting list initiative has made recommendations to me on the measures required to tackle unduly long waiting <Col N="1041" /> lists and waiting times, in an integrated manner, in the longer term.  I have commenced the implementation of the report of the review group and the tackling of unduly long waiting lists and waiting times will remain a priority during my term of office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 to 329 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the registration system, is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for registrars who operate under his general direction.  The functions of An t-Árd Chláraitheoir include a certification function; an authorisation function; a custodian function in relation to certain records and an overall function as guarantor of the legal adequacy of the registration system.  Registrars of births, deaths and marriages are obliged to register all births, deaths, and Roman Catholic marriages and stillbirths which occur within their districts and, in so doing, have the important function of creating evidence acceptable in court in relation to events which have a major significance in relation to an individual's civil status and to his rights and entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> In addition, Registrars of Marriages appointed under the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844, carry out duties in relation to the taking of notice, the solemnisation and registration of marriages.  All registrars are obliged to furnish An t-Árd Chláraitheoir with copies of entries in their registrars on a quarterly basis to enable him to compile a national record of all such events and construct a national index to his records.</P>
    <P>All certified copies of individual register entries, i.e. certificates, which are issued from the General Register Office are impressed with the seal of An t-Árd Chláraitheoir.  His records are direct copies of local register entries.  An t-Árd Chláraitheoir is obliged to stand over and guarantee the authority of entries in the local registers of births, deaths and marriages, wherever they are effected, and must ensure that registration practices at all levels throughout the State meet the requirements laid down in the Registration Acts.</P>
    <P>There is no provision under the Registration Acts for certificates to be issued other than by registrars of births, deaths and marriages, superintendent registrars, registrars of marriages and An t-Árd Chláraitheoir and it would neither be feasible from a practical or legal viewpoint to transfer registration records to the National Archive.</P>
    <P>The structure of registration was originally based on transport and communication systems of the 19th century and is somewhat fragmented and cumbersome having regard to the needs and technology of the 20th century.  A number of measures have been taken to rationalise the system. The number of districts has been substantially reduced from the initial 1,000 through rationalisation and amalgamation, particularly in recent years, to reduce the burden of administration, improve efficiency and prepare for the eventual computerisation of the registration process. At present there are 303 districts of registrars of births, deaths and marriages and there is potential to further reduce the number of districts to 120 in the medium term, provided local agreement can be achieved.  In addition, there are 29 registrars of marriages appointed under the Act of 1844.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the development of a modern registration structure will also require some change in the law to facilitate the restructuring of the role of the registrar, to permit more flexibility in the appointment of assistant registrars in the busier districts and to avail of the advantages offered by computerisation in relation to certificate production.</P>
    <P>Registrars require an adequate knowledge of registration law, adequate guidance and training and appropriate interpersonal skills.  Recent changes in the law in relation to stillbirths, marriage notifications and birth registration have provided an additional impetus to the training of registrars, which is provided by the General Register Office with the co-operation of the health boards.  Registrars have been provided with easy-to-follow guidelines in relation to birth <Col N="1043" /> registration, stillbirth registration and marriage notification and the public have been provided with basic information in relation to the operation of the new legislation to facilitate effective and informed registration.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the General Register Office archival project in Roscommon is currently engaged in a major project to computerise the records held by An t-Árd Chláraitheorí. The first phase in this operation involves the electronic imaging of the archival records of the office which go back to 1844 and the conversion of the index to these records to an electronic format.  Most of the indexes to the records of births, deaths and marriages held in the General Register Office were in printed format only.  This phase of the work will take between three to four years to complete.</P>
    <P>A later stage of the project will include the development of a sophisticated retrieval system and the Deputy will appreciate that the new technology will provide opportunities for a much more efficient access, not only to the index, but also to the record itself from a number of locations.  The flexibility afforded by computerisation will facilitate the transfer of the General Register Office to Roscommon as planned while retaining research facilities in Dublin.  Matters such as the alternative means of access to indexes to the records through such bodies as the National Library or the National Archive or local bodies will also be considered at that juncture.</P>
    <P>The General Register Office has within the past 12 months purchased seven new microfilm reader printers which has improved the quality of its photocopies and the efficiency of their production. A new file server has been commissioned to facilitate the loading of additional index material produced by the archive conversion project and there are plans to load additional such material in 1999.  In recent weeks space has been made available for the expansion of the research facility in Dublin by the relocation of staff but some renovations and adjustments have to be made before this can be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>However, because a significent proportion of indexes to the records are in paper format and because certificates must be written by hand, the certificate production of the General Register Office is currently highly dependent on human resources in the short term.  Because of this, and because of increased demand for the authorisation function of An t-Árd Chláraitheoir, savings in manpower resources have been difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>The number of civil servants employed by the General Register Office is 67 and, in addition, there are 40 part-time trainees employed on the project in Roscommon.  The annual personnel costs of the General Register Office is £1.1 million and, in addition, there are annual trainee costs, including grants for some materials and training of £267,000.  Non-pay costs are of the order of £365,000, but this figure does not include <Col N="1044" /> some shared costs which could not be isolated, or certain one-off costs for technology.</P>
    <P>The precise level of increase in fees, including fees for searches, certificates and marriages, is still under examination.  Having regard for the need to put the funding of the service on a more structured basis, the length of time since the last increase in 1987, the increase in the costs of inputs in the interim and the requirement to recover a reasonable proportion of the direct costs of the service it will be appreciated that the present fee structure is seriously out of line with the direct costs of the service.</P>

These are intended to assist both planning authorities and An Bord Pleanala as well as operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with applications for planning permission for telecommunications antennae and support structures.

      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 (Article 9(1)(b)) provided that antennae support structures, subject to certain criteria, would be exempted development for a period of six months from the coming into force of the regulations on 16 May 1994.  Eircell was the only licensed mobile phone operator at that time.</P>
      <P>The Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1997, which came into force on 13 February 1997, dealt with the position in relation to the addition of antennae for mobile telephony to existing radio masts by licensed operators.  The regulations amended the existing exempted development regulations by including two new classes of exempted development, viz, the attachment to an existing radio mast of antannae for mobile telephony and the replacement of an existing mast, subject to certain conditions and undertakings.  The regulations apply to all licensed mobile telephone operators.</P>

      <P>A year 2000 impact assessment study was undertaken in my Department between October 1996 and February 1997.

      <P>The main focus in 1998 has been on the critical systems used to support administration of the wide range of payment schemes in the Department. Year 2000 remediation work on these systems is now 95 per cent complete and is on target for finalisation by the end of the first quarter of 1999.</P>

      <P>Consultants were used to assist with the impact assessment study.  A small amount of consultancy has also been used to assist with specialist activities during the project, e.g. database performance testing and to review the overall approach to software testing.  The project was, however, undertaken largely by internal staff, many of whom were diverted from other work for the duration of the project.  Approval was given for 45 additional posts to assist with the necessary remediation work and for 16 additional posts to support roll-out of the new network components.</P>

      <P>EU regulations on social security provide for the protection of the social security rights of workers who are or have been employed or self-employed in more than one member state.  One of the main ways in which the regulations provide for this protection is through the aggregation of periods of insurance completed in the member states where a person has worked for the purposes of meeting the contribution conditions for entitlement to benefit.  All the periods of insurance completed in the other member states are treated as if they were completed in the state where the claim to benefit is made.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the short-term benefits, such as unemployment and disability, a claimant must generally have been lastly insured in the state of claim and have sufficient contributions paid or credited over a relatively short period.  If they qualify for these benefits, even on the basis of aggregation, the full amount due is paid by the state of last insurance.  Many claimants who have previously worked abroad, however, would already have completed sufficient periods of insurance in Ireland after their return to qualify for benefit, without recourse to the periods of insurance completed in the other state(s).</P>
      <P>In the case of long-term benefits such as retirement, old age and widowed persons pensions, entitlement is based on periods of insurance completed over a person's career since entry into insurance.  Where a person has been insured in more that one member state, each state works out the level of pension payable by it on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.</P>
      <P>The nature of the contribution conditions for pensions in Ireland is such that where there is an entitlement under Irish legislation the pension amount is usually higher than the <i>pro rata</i> amount and, therefore, the award of pension can be made without recourse to the periods of insurance in other states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The highest proportion of claimants in Ireland with periods of insurance in other member states have completed them in the United Kingdom. Procedures for the transfer of insurance records <Col N="1054" /> between both states have long been in place and have until recently been working satisfactorily. The UK contribution agency has been developing a new national insurance recording computer system for holding their insurance records, recording new contributions and calculating contributory benefits.  The changeover to the new system was scheduled for July 1998 and my Department was advised by the UK Department of Social Security to expect delays in the transfer of records for up to eight weeks after the new system was introduced until it became fully operational.</P>
    <P>Unexpected difficulties have arisen with the new system.  As a result delays in the transfer of UK records have continued throughout the period since July.  On the basis of the latest information received by my Department from the UK Department of Social Security, the delays are expected to continue until early in the new year, at which stage it is expected the problems with the new system will be resolved.</P>
    <P>For the reasons given above it is possible, in the case of a significant number of persons who have completed periods of insurance in other member states, to deal with their claims and award benefits and pensions without recourse to details of their periods of insurance in the other state(s).  It is estimated, however, that 9,581 contribution records have been requested from the UK to date this year.  Of these a significant proportion were processed before the UK developed its new computerised records system.  No significant delays have been experienced in the case of recent insurance records requested for short-term benefits purposes.  Records prior to 6 April 1975 are also not affected and can still be readily accessed by the UK on the old system.</P>
    <P>There are, however, some 1,300 requests for records outstanding in relation to claims for widow's and widower's contributory pensions, retirement pensions and old age contributory pensions.  The pensioners concerned have insufficient Irish contributions to qualify for a pension under social welfare legislation alone and thus are eligible only for a <i>pro rata</i> pension which requires their UK insurance record.  A high proportion of the claimants, up to 60 per cent, reside in the UK.</P>
    <P>Officials in my Department have been in regular contact with their counterparts in the UK on the matter and special interim arrangements have been made to minimise delays.  Consideration is also being given to ways of speeding up the processing of the backlog of claims which will arise when the difficulties with the UK computerised system are resolved and the outstanding records become available.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, claimants resident in this country who are affected are being advised, if they have insufficient means, to claim the corresponding non-contributory payment under social assistance or the supplementary welfare allowance. When the claims for the social insurance benefits are processed, on receipt of the outstanding insurance records from the UK, the full outstanding arrears due will be paid.</P>

      <P>Voluntary and community groups play an important part in improving the quality of the lives of people by helping them to develop the capacity to change their situation for the better.  However, disadvantaged communities require support to enable them realise this potential to play a real part and have a real say in their own development.  My Department has for a number of years supported local self-help and community development initiatives through a range of programmes which prior to 1998 included the following once-off grant schemes: scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups; scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups; scheme of grants to locally-based lone parent groups; scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and community development education and training grant schemes.</P>
      <P>There was enhanced emphasis in the grants schemes in 1998 on supporting families and parenting and with this in mind the schemes of grants for women's, men's and lone parents' groups were integrated in 1998 in a new scheme of grants for locally-based community and family support groups.</P>
      <P>This scheme continues the existing supports for women's, men's and lone parents' groups, while also giving the Department the flexibility to respond to the needs of local community development groups that comprise both men and women, family support groups that focus on helping individuals and communities in the family context and special interest groups such as travellers' groups, self-help groups of people with disabilities and others that target sectoral disadvantage. The other once-off grants schemes, the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations and the community development education and training grants scheme, also continue to operate in 1998.</P>
      <P>In 1998, under the scheme of grants to locally-based community and family support groups, the facility to commit for periods of two or three years for particularly worthwhile on-going projects was also introduced.  In addition to the main scheme, three-year core funding in the range of £8,000 to £20,000 is also available for more established and developed groups with a specific antipoverty focus who work with a wider group of disadvantaged people and have potential to make a substantial impact in their local communities with enhanced funding.  To date, 32 groups have been approved for inclusion in this programme with core-funding of £375,664 being made available to them to date in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> In total a sum of £2.825 million was allocated to the range of once-off schemes in 1998, representing an increase of £100,000 over the 1997 allocation.  In addition, in the recent budget an additional £13,000 was allocated to these schemes for 1999 bringing the allocation for that year to £2.838 million.</P>
    <P>Details of the grants made under the individual schemes have been made available to the Dáil Library since 1990 and details of the grants paid under the 1998 schemes, including the new integrated scheme of grants to locally-based community and family support groups, will be made available to the Dáil Library early in 1999.</P>
    <P>While it is not possible to indicate at this stage the amount of funding allocated in 1998 specifically to women's groups under the new integrated scheme, my Department expect that the level of funding made available to these groups in 1998 will compare favourably with the level of funding made available to them in recent years under the previous scheme.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 351, 352, 353 and 354 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme is administered by the health boards under the general direction and control of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The basic purpose of the scheme is to ensure that no person faces hardship because <Col N="1057" /> their means are insufficient to meet their needs. Health boards have responded over the years to the extra demands placed on people at Christmas time by making exceptional needs payments, ENPs, under the SWA scheme.</P>
    <P>However, practice has evolved differently in the eight health boards.  In some instances, needs are assessed on a case by case basis taking into account the particular needs of the individuals concerned while in other instances, a standardised payment is issued without assessment of the individual's needs.</P>
    <P>The standard amount paid differed from health board to health board, as did the criteria applied to who would get a payment and who would not. Standardised payments at 100 per cent of the basic weekly payment were made in three health boards.  Standardised payments at 70 per cent of the basic weekly payment were made in three other health boards.  Standardised payments at 100 per cent of the basic weekly payment were made in some areas within one health board and at 70 per cent in other areas within that health board.  No standardised payments were issued in one health board but additional payments were made at Christmas time through the ENP system, in the normal manner.</P>
    <P>These standardised payments gave rise to anomalies and inequitable treatment of people in similar financial circumstances.  For that reason, a circular was issued to health boards on 27 November to ensure that those who receive a standardised payment were treated in a fair, equal and consistent manner.  That circular related solely to standardised payments issued at Christmas time and not to ENPs calculated and issued in the normal manner.</P>
    <P>The fact that different amounts are paid is a normal feature of ENPs where each case is dealt with on an individual basis.  In fact, it is one of the strengths of the SWA system that it allows the State to be responsibe to individuals' needs. The payment of an ENP is an immediate response to an exceptional need and in this context, the question of retrospection does not arise.</P>
    <P>There were over 17,000 people in receipt of a basic weekly SWA payment at the beginning of December 1998 and it is estimated that over a third of these will receive an additional exceptional needs payment in 1998.  Statistics on the numbers of persons in receipt of SWA at the beginning of December for the past five years are not available.</P>
    <P>Standardised ENP payments are not recorded separately from normal ENP expenditure and the figures requested by the Deputy in relation to previous years are not available.</P>

      <P>Where a married couple are involved in a bona fide business partnership, a liability for PRSI exists in respect of each and each can qualify for old age contributory pensions in his or her own right provided that the statutory contribution conditions are satisfied.</P>
      <P>While married couples can operate a business under a partnership arrangement, there are specific requirements under company law regarding partnerships generally.  There are also specific requirements under the Income Tax Acts regarding the returns of income relating to persons, married or otherwise, involved in a partnership. The Revenue Commissioners act as agents for my Department in relation to the assessment and collection of PRSI.  Based on the declarations of income made to them they will collect PRSI due in respect of each insured person.</P>
      <P>The insurability position under the Social Welfare Acts of spouses who consider themselves to be self-employed on a partnership basis is examined on an individual case basis.  Under the Acts the employment of a spouse is an &ldquo;excepted employment&rdquo; and is not insurable.  Similarly, the employment of the spouse of a self-employed contributor who assists but is not a partner in the business is not insurable.

      <P>A central principle of my Department's strategy is to avail of the opportunities for improvement in service delivery offered by developments in technology and telecommunications. In particular it is intended to facilitate our customers by developing, in addition to our local office network, new modes of access to our services through greater use of the telephone and the Internet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised that many people will need assistance to access our services electronically.  In this regard there is an important role for voluntary and local groups and for existing networks of access points such as public libraries and other <Col N="1059" /> public offices.  My Department operates a number of grant schemes for community and voluntary groups and funding is also available within those schemes to meet the costs of necessary equipment and training to use information technology in communications and service delivery.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1998, provided the enabling legislation for the use of a single personal public service number, a public services card and the sharing of information between public bodies for specified purposes.  This will allow greater efficiency across the public service and will facilitate the reorganisation and integration of services around the customer.  It is intended that the public services card will be developed as a platform for the citizen to transact business electronically with the public service.</P>
    <P>In delivering payments to customers my Department's policy is to offer improved customer service and to achieve increased efficiencies in the methods of delivery.  One of the options in this regard is to extend the use of electronic funds transfer as a direct payment method.  The Ennis Information Age Town project, with which my Department is currently involved, will provide further information regarding the practical benefits for citizens to be achieved through the development of e-commerce.</P>
    <P>My Department's Internet site, while still at the development stage, is also already attracting significant interest across a wide range of users. While information dissemination has been the primary focus of the site to date, we are also looking at new and different ways of handling the business through this mode both in respect of transactions with customers and also in business dealings with suppliers.  It is the intention to develop the site to become an interactive access channel for our customers.</P>
    <P>On a broader front, my Department intends to continue to play its full part in developing and implementing the concepts and practices of electronic Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual date of implementation of the new scheme remains to be settled but it is my intention that the scheme will come into operation as soon as is practicable.  The range of operational issues relating to the introduction of the new <Col N="1060" /> scheme are currently being considered by my Department, in consultation with the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, in the interim, it is open to farmers on low incomes to apply for the income support available under the unemployment assistance (smallholders assistance) scheme. Similarly, existing claimants may apply to have their means re-assessed at any time if they consider that their income has deteriorated since they were last subject to a means assessment.</P>

      <P>White Strand, Doonbeg, County Clare, is included in the Carrowmore-Whitestrand proposed candidate SAC (Special Area of Conservation) &mdash; a priority habitat site under the EU Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>All proposed candidate SACs are open to objection, on scientific grounds, and to review by Dúchas, the Heritage Service of my Department, in the light of current scientific knowledge.</P>
      <P>The proposed candidate SAC at Carrowmore-Whitestrand had been given the proposed NHA boundary (drawn from aerial photographs) until such time as the site could receive a visit from a scientific expert.  This boundary was issued to ensure that the extent of the ecologically important area was protected; it was known that the extent of the boundary was larger than could be justified under the criteria listed in the EU Habitats Directive.  The then boundary was a temporary measure put in place until a more detailed review could be carried out by Dúchas. This review was instigated by Dúchas prior to my taking up office and included a site visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Scientific experts from Dúchas (the Competent Authority in Ireland), visited the site in November 1997.  This visit led to the conclusion that the eastern side of the sand dune system at Doonbeg had been significantly damaged due to a long history of sand <Col N="1062" /> extraction.  The remaining intact portion consists of the priority habitat &ldquo;fixed dunes with herbaceous vegetation&rdquo; and the three non-priority habitats &ldquo;dune slack&rdquo;, embryonic shifting dunes&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Ammophilia dunes &mdash; White dunes&rdquo;, which make up the bulk of the site.  It is the habitats present on this intact portion which justifies the proposed designation of the area as an SAC.  As a result of this scientific surveillance, the proposed site boundaries are being modified to reflect the requirements of the Habitats Directive (Annex III) and the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997.  No significant habitat interest has been excluded from the site.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission was informed of the above reasons for the changes made to this site.</P>

      <P>While I am aware that art works of Irish origin can command significant prices on the art investment market, these prices are of course determined by market forces in the art world.

      <P>It is a core function of the National Cultural Institutions under the aegis of my Department to enlarge the national collections with relevant artwork within their own collection policies and within the amount of funding available for this purpose from the Exchequer, having regard to the overall resources available to them for this purpose and to prioritising by them within their resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 tax relief is available in respect of the donation of important national heritage items to the national collections on the basis of certain criteria.  This facility is becoming <Col N="1063" /> an increasingly important factor in the retention within Ireland of art works of Irish origin.

      <P>I am satisfied that both my Department and the offices and agencies under the aegis of my Department have a detailed programme of work in place to prepare for year 2000 compliance and that every effort is being made to ensure that compliance is achieved.</P>
      <P>A Year 2000 Monitoring Committee is in place to monitor and report on progress in this regard. Relevant divisions of my Department and each of the agencies and offices under my Department's aegis are represented on the monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>In relation to critical systems in my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Courts, the Prisons Service and the Land Registry, the Deputy will appreciate that major computerisation programmes are in place in any event for these organisations.  Many systems due for delivery in phase 1 of PULSE ( Police Using Leading Systems Effectively) will replace non-compliant mainframe systems in the Garda Síochána.  Similarly the new courts and prisons systems and the Land Registry Title Registration System will replace non-compliant systems.  These systems will also provide significantly increased functionality in addition to ensuring compliance.  In addition, there are a number of smaller computerisation projects under way in the other agencies associated with my Department.</P>
      <P>Similarly office equipment and plant fall to be replaced over a period and their replacement with equipment and plant which is year 2000 compliant is ongoing for some time now.</P>
      <P>In relation to the costs associated with replacement of the equipment in question, the Deputy will appreciate that, while the computerisation programmes in place will assist my Department and the agencies-offices concerned in ensuring year 2000 compliance, it would be unfair to say that the funding involved has been allocated to these programmes simply to deal with the year 2000 problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No additional staff have been taken on for year 2000 work.  There was a separate short consultancy <Col N="1065" /> project (involving three external consultants) earlier this year to determine the scale of the problem faced by my Department. While there are consultants employed at present by the Department in relation to the major computerisation programmes for the Garda Síochána, the courts, the prisons, the Land Registry and for my Department, these have not been engaged to deal with year 2000 compliance.  However, year 2000 compliance will be a by-product of their work.</P>
    <P>In relation to general policing matters I am informed by the Garda authorities that where a policing function is required, contingency plans form part of the overall plan to police any given situation.</P>

      <P>The operation of the petitions procedure fundamentally changed in April 1995 as a result of a High Court judgment on petitions. The processing of petitions virtually ceased while the implications of the judgment were considered. New guidlines and procedures to give effect to the judgment were subsequently issued.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, I directed that a petitions clearance programme be undertaken with a view to having all outstanding petitions, including applications to have a petition opened, finalised in the shortest possible time.  Substantial progress is being achieved; for example, in the 11 month period to the end of November 1998, 1,768 decisions have issued to petitioners, compared with 671 for the calendar year 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland fully lives up to its international obligations in the asylum area. People entitled under international law to protection are given protection.</P>
      <P>An applicant for refugee status must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear exists, the applicant will be granted refugee status.  Each application is individually examined and it is only after such examination is completed that a decision on its well-foundedness can be taken.  Where it is established that a well-founded fear of persecution does not exist, the applicant will be refused refugee status in the State and s/he must return to his or her country of origin.  The UNHCR recognise this and are on record as stating that such returns are necessary to protect the integrity of the asylum process.</P>
      <P>The fact that officials of the government process an application at the initial stage does not prejudice the applicant's case.  Each application for refugee status is fully and fairly considered and each applicant has access to an independent appeals system and legal representation.  These are the principles by which I am operating and will continue to operate.</P>
      <P>As I have recently announced, agreement has been reached with the Legal Aid Board on arrangements for the provision of a comprehensive legal service for asylum seekers.  The Refugee Legal Service will be independent of the Department and will provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers.  It will assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure.</P>
      <P>Where an appeal is made within the specified time against a decision to refuse refugee status, the applicant is supplied with all the material on which the decision was based.  The appeal is then determined by an independent Appeals Authority, a person independent of myself and the Department with at least ten years practice as a solicitor or barrister appointed by me for this purpose. The Appeals Authority is provided with all of the information provided to the applicant and with such submissions as may be made by or on behalf of the applicant in connection with the appeal.  The Appeals Authority may make a decision based on the papers only or, where the applicant has so requested, following an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the procedures are reasonable, fair, transparent and in accordance with the philosophy of the Refugee Act.  They are also in accordance with our international obligations and humanitarian traditions in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> In May 1997, the UNHCR representative at the time wrote to my officials and stated, <i>inter alia,</i>&ldquo;we recognise that it is imperative that mediumterm procedural arrangements to deal with the backlog in an expeditious manner be set up&rdquo;.  The refugee determination procedures were put in place following extensive consultations with the UNHCR and the UNHCR has stated &ldquo;overall, we believe that the revised document provides for a balanced administrative procedure pending the entry into force of the Refugee Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive training is provided on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the UNHCR for all members of staff of the Asylum Division. A representative of UNHCR has been placed here at the Department's request and at the Department's expense to assist in establishing procedures, in providing training and in quality proofing the assessment procedures.  The UNHCR representative is notified of the making of each application.  The UNHCR representative may attend any interview or hearing in connection with the above proceedings and may have access to the papers relating to any particular case at any stage during the processing of an application. Where the UNHCR representative considers it appropriate, he may make unsolicited representations relating to any case or group of cases; such representations will be taken into account in arriving at a decision.</P>
    <P>Recently, I had a very cordial meeting with two senior officials from UNHCR Headquarters.  At that meeting, the UNHCR officials in question were unstinting in their praise of the efforts of the Irish authorities to manage the processing of asylum applications here in a fair manner.</P>
    <P>The Department undertakes to operate the procedures in a spirit of co-operation with the UNHCR with a view to ensuring that no person deserving of protection in the State is refused it.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to this House on several occasions, I am of the view that the Refugee Act in its present form is unworkable for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>The Act and its procedures were designed to process approximately 300 to 400 applications per year.  However, we have experienced an enormous growth in the number of asylum seekers with over 4,000 applications recorded so far this year &mdash; the Act only provided for the appointment of one refugee applications commissioner and one appeal board with no powers of delegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1071" /> It is intended to review the question of the implementation of the Refugee Act in the light of a comparative study between Irish and EU member states refugee legislation which has been commissioned and is due to be completed by the end of the year and having regard to the experience gained in the Department in the operation of the current refugee determination procedures.</P>
    <P>As I have recently announced, agreement has been reached with the Legal Aid Board on arrangements for the provision of a comprehensive legal service for asylum seekers.  The Refugee Legal Service will be independent of the Department and will provide legal advice and representaton for asylum seekers.  It will assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure.</P>
    <P>There is no requirement in the Refugee Act, 1996 to provide legal advice and representation for asylum seekers.  The Refugee Act section 11, subsection (8) merely provides that an applicant may consult a solicitor.  However, pending the introduction of a comprehensive scheme, my Department currently provides £120 (plus VAT) per case in legal aid for asylum seekers to present their cases to the Appeals Authority.  The amount is paid to the legal representatives, who are engaged independently by asylum seekers, on certification by the Appeals Authority that the representatives have acted in the case.  The fee of £120 is the same as that paid by the Legal Aid Board under its private practitioners' scheme for legal services provided for certain District Court family law cases.</P>

However, in relation to the article cited by the Deputy, I can confirm that my Department's press office briefed the newspaper in question, on its request, in this matter which arises in the wake of a recent very cordial meeting which I had with two senior officials from UNHCR Headquarters.  At that meeting, the UNHCR officials in question were unstinting in their praise of the efforts of the Irish authorities to manage the processing of asylum applications here in a fair manner.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee established by the Garda Commissioner to examine CCTV systems as an aid to policing and to evaluate each application has received in excess of 25 applications for the installation of Garda CCTV systems.  At present six locations have been prioritised for the installation of Garda CCTV systems as an aid to policing.  The prioritised locations are at Bray, Cork, Dublin (south central), Dundalk, Finglas and Limerick.</P>
      <P>The remaining applications are still under consideration by the committee and it is anticipated that further systems will be scheduled in due course as resources permit.  As of yet, no proposal for the Ballyfermot area has been received by the CCTV Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>Each of the applications will be prioritised with regard to the respective levels of crime in the locations in question and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system on same.  Applications are also evaluated from a technical and telecommunications perspective.  It is only fair to say, however, that the commitment to existing schemes, as well as those prioritised by the advisory committee, limits the scope for the extension of Garda CCTV systems to other areas at the present time.</P>
      <P>Funding of Garda CCTV systems is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It has been the experience of the Garda Authorities that the cost of an efficient and effective CCTV system is, on average, £20,000 to £25,000 per camera.  Each application submitted must also be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda District and Divisional Officers and receive their full support.</P>

The press statement issued by my Department on 28 October made explicitly clear that the settlement of Mr. Cooney's case and the associated statement made in court did not imply that any other holder of the Office of the Minister for Justice was guilty of wrongdoing or breach of the law in this case in authorising interception of telecommunication messages.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 390 together.</P>
      <P>I have no power to order the release of Garda investigation files.  The position of the Garda authorities remains that it would be contrary to long-standing practice in this case to make files of this kind available to any parties and that it is not proposed to depart from that practice in this case.  The Deputy will also be aware that the High Court and, subsequently, the Supreme Court on appeal in their judgments of 27 August 1997 and 22 July 1998, respectively, dismissed a claim by a relative of one of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings seeking access to the Garda investigation file for the purposes of his complaint against the United Kingdom to the European Commission of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>However, I am anxious to do anything I can to address the needs of all those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.  I obtained Government approval in May of this year for the establishment of the Victims Commission headed by former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, who was asked to identify what further measures need to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of these persons and, in particular, the needs and concerns of victims and the family of victims of major outrages including those of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Victims Commission that Mr. Wilson's consultations with the victims and relatives of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings are continuing.  I am also informed that <Col N="1076" /> he has not, in fact, made any recommendation in relation to their concerns and does not intend doing so until after his consultations are completed. I wish to assure the House that the Government will, of course, carefully consider any recommendations made by Mr. Wilson in due course.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the document to which the Deputy refers.  In relation to the siting of telecommunications masts, the Garda Síochána has an absolute need to maintain an infrastructure appropriate to its communications requirements, from an operational perspective.</P>
      <P>With regard to Esat Digifone, the second licensed mobile telephone operator, a contract was entered into with the company, which is dated 25 June 1997, with the approval of the previous Government, providing for the co-location of mobile telephony equipment at a number of specified Garda masts and-or sites.</P>
      <P>Under this agreement, access to Garda sites is subject to Digifone complying fully with all planning requirements, health and safety legislation, the Radiological Protection Act and all relevant guidelines that may be set down from time to time by the International Radiation Protection Association.</P>

      <P>My Department has a number of major systems development programmes under way in the Garda, Land Registry, courts <Col N="1077" /> and prisons covering operational, administrative and financial systems.</P>
      <P>Each individual project includes examination of business options including those for putting electronic transactions in place of existing paper or cash and thus enabling the development of e-commerce facilities which will expand the Department's ability to conduct its business electronically. The initial phases of most of these systems are due during 1999 and are concentrated on internal transactions.  Later phases will involve electronic service delivery to members of the public and to companies.  My Department is represented on a number of appropriate interdepartmental committees to ensure that its systems delivery in this regard will be in line with best practice as it develops.</P>
      <P>As recently as 1 December each officer in the Department was given a unique e-mail address. The old e-mail address which appears on my Department's official stationery may still be used in the interim, my Department is in the process of amending all stationery accordingly.  This allows them to be contacted directly by members of the public and the staff of other Departments through the use of the Internet.  Officers may provide replies electronically through the same medium.</P>
      <P>Many divisions within the Department have also been assigned e-mail addresses for example, citizenship, courts, law reform, equality, thereby allowing the general public direct contact.  The specific addresses are listed on the Department's Internet website which can be found at the web address http://www.  irlgov.  ie/justice.  All press releases and speeches and most departmental reports and commissioned research are published on the web site as are details of certain schemes of general public interest, for example, details on the rules for citizenship or guidelines on parental leave legislation.</P>
      <P>While a significant proportion of the budget of the systems delivery programme is allocated for staff training, there are no external schemes or grants from my Department to assist in the use of information technology.</P>

      <P>The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, was published in November 1988 and came into operation on 29 December 1989.</P>
      <P>There were two main reasons for the Act.  First, prohibition on incitement to hatred had been identified by an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Attorney General's office as a legislative change that was required before Ireland could ratify the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Second, section 4 of the Act created a new offence of preparing or possessing material or recordings of a racist or such like offensive nature to be distributed or broadcast in the State or elsewhere.  This provision was not required for ratification of the UN Covenant but was necessary to deal with a relatively minor problem at the time of this country being used for the preparation of racist material for distribution here and abroad.</P>

    <P>Thirty seven persons are involved in conducting substantive interviews of asylum seekers within the Asylum Division of my Department including 25 retired public servants recruited as part-time contractors who represent 15 full-time posts.  There are no interpreters on my staff, however, the services of independent and qualified interpreters are availed of when required.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to assess the actual average time from start to finish of the asylum determination process.  However, it is my hope that with the additional staff recruited to my Department's Asylum Division, the new Refugee Legal Service and the three appeals Authorities considered appeals in the Refugee Applications Centre, Mount Street from early in 1999 onwards, new cases will be finalised in a matter of months.  I am of course concerned that every effort should be made to deal with outstanding cases.  With this in mind, my Department has concentrated on ensuring that the oldest applications are given priority in scheduling cases from the backlog of interview, while simultaneously dealing with new applicants as soon as possible after their arrival in the State.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated to this House on several occasions I am of the view that the Refugee Act in its present form is unworkable for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>The Act and its procedures were designed to process approximately 300 to 400 applications per year. However, we have experienced an enormous growth in the number of asylum seekers with over 4,000 applications recorded so far this year &mdash; the Act only provided for the appointment of one Refugee Applications Commissioner and one appeal board with no powers of delegation.</P>
      <P>It is intended to review the question of the implementation of the Refugee Act in the light of a comparative study between Irish and EU member states refugee legislation which has been commissioned and is due to be completed by the end of the year and having regard to the experience gained in the Department in the operation of the current refugee determination procedures.</P>
      <P>In relation to allowing immigrants to work while awaiting consideration of their application for residency, I would refer the Deputy to my Parliamentary Question No. 26 to of 26 November 1998.</P>
      <P>I have nothing further to add at present.</P>

An assessment committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, is currently evaluating the plans submitted by the 13 development groups in the local drugs task force areas, with a view to making recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, early in the new year.</P>
      <P>As part of the assessment process, the committee is having a series of meetings with the development groups to allow them to present the plans, which encompass 300 projects and to examine, in depth, the various elements of each plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has ensured that all products purchased since 1997 are year 2000 compliant. In addition, my Department is currently implementing a major programme of work designed to ensure that all its existing IT systems and all of the hardware and software components of its IT infrastructure will continue to work through the changeover to the next millennium. The programme of work also deals with the potential impact of the millennium bug on non-IT equipment with embedded electronics e.g. phone systems, lifts, security systems etc.</P>
      <P>My Department's programme of work is progressing well towards the goal of ensuring that any adverse effects of the millennium bug on the Department's operations will be minimal.</P>
      <P>With regard to bodies under the aegis of my Department, status reports are sought from 90 bodies every two months and these form the basis of bimonthly progress reports to Government.  It would appear that a number of bodies, particularly larger bodies, are making good progress at present but continuing close monitoring of the general situation will be necessary.</P>
      <P>The total amount of money included in this year's departmental Estimates for new IT equipment, office equipment and consultancy for my Department in 1999 is £930,000.  In spending this allocation, priority will continue to be given to implementing new or upgraded IT systems or office equipment required to ensure the achievement of year 2000 compliance by my Department. I anticipate that approximately 70 per cent of the £930,000 allocation will be devoted to this purpose. Bodies under the aegis of my Department will continue in 1999 to address year 2000 problems from within their existng resources, if necessary by re-prioritising expenditure.  In the event of additional funding being required to address critical Y2K problems identified in embedded systems in use in these bodies in 1999, application will be made to the Department of Finance for the necessary resources to be made available from the £40 million central emergency fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While no additional staff have been taken on by my Department solely for year 2000 work, six staff were assigned to the IT unit of my Department during 1998 and these staff, in addition to existing staff, are being assigned to year 2000 related work as required.  My Department has also engaged outside consultants to carry out both computer applications conversion work and to assist with monitoring the progress towards year 2000 compliance of bodies under my Department's <Col N="1092" /> aegis.  The total number of consultancy days involved is 230 in 1998.</P>

I assume the Deputy is referring to the staff allocation at the school in the 1999-2000 school year.  If this is the case, then I must point out to the Deputy that I have not yet made any decisions regarding staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1999-2000 school year.</P>
      <P>In the current school year, the school has a staffing of a principal and three teachers based on the school's enrolment of 117 pupils in September 1997.  I understand that the enrolment at the school in the current year is 120 pupils which is capable of being managed within maximum class size guidelines.</P>

      <P>One of my priorities regarding third level grants is to ensure that students receive their first maintenance payment as early as possible in the academic year.  With this in mind I brought the recoupment arrangements for the local authorities to a current year basis in 1997, which improved the timeliness of payments to students during 1997-98.  For the 1997-98 academic year, I understand that 31 of the 33 local authorities had paid a substantial number of first instalments by the end of October.  Only two local authorities had less than 50 per cent of first instalments paid. The delay in making first instalment payments arose in cases where the local authorities were awaiting further information from applicants or where late applications were accepted.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to introduce an up front payment of the maintenance grant, or registration grant which would be deducted from the maintenance grant, as suggested by the Union of Students in Ireland.  On the contrary, I believe that such an approach to further segment the payment of maintenance grants would increase the administrative burden on the local authorities, vocational education committees and the colleges, without any benefit being derived by the students.  I have discussed this issue with the Union of Students in Ireland and asked the union to advise me of any difficulties its members are encountering with delays in receipt of maintenance grants.  On the general issue of the administration of the student support schemes, a joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is undertaking a detailed review of the current arrangements.  This review will involve the participation of interested parties and I have previously indicated that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>

      <P>I recently announced a major funding initiative for the education sector.</P>
      <P>At second level, a total of 225 new teachers will be appointed.  Combined with a very significant change to the manner of dealing with over-quota staffing in secondary schools, these new teachers will enable a move towards the provision of an automatic remedial resource in all schools and home-school-community liaison in all disadvantaged schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new package will be resourced by allocating an additional teaching provision to schools which are within quota and lack the appropriate <Col N="1094" /> remedial and home-school provision.  In the case of schools with over quota teachers who might otherwise be re-deployed, this resource will be utilised in the first instance to meet the remedial and home-school needs of the school.</P>
    <P>Following the implementation of the above package some schools will nonetheless have on their staff over-quota permanent teachers.  In deciding on whether or not these teachers come within the redeployment scheme, a ratio of 18:1 will be utilised.  The impact of this is that schools will be allowed to retain teachers who might otherwise have been placed on the redeployment panel.  This will give schools greater certainty in relation to the utilisation of these permanent teachers pending the occurrence of retirements.</P>

      <P>I intend taking Questions Nos. 415 and 416 together.</P>
      <P>There are 93 ordinary national schools in County Kildare.  To determine the pupil teacher ratio in each individual school requires the retrieval of data relating to both enrolments and teacher allocation in every single school in the county.  This process represents an inordinate demand in resources which cannot be justified.</P>
      <P>The pupil teacher ratio at national level is in the order of 21.2:1 in the current year.  Undoubtedly, there are schools in County Kildare which have a pupil teacher ratio in excess of this national level in the same way as there are likely to be some schools with a ratio below this level.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio for the voluntary secondary schools in County Kildare is as follows:</P>

      <P>The substance of the letter in question dealt with the provision made for pupils with specific learning difficulties in the certificate examinations.  A letter setting out the position in this regard was issued to the parent concerned by the examinations branch of my Department in June last.</P>
      <P>Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into ordinary classes.  If necessary, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teachers.</P>
      <P>Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in a range of special schools and special classes dedicated to the needs of the children in question.</P>
      <P>In 1997, my Department allocated funds to the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities to assist in its administration service and to facilitate access to workshops and summer schools for children from disadvantaged areas.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that an additional sum of £50,000 has been allocated to the association.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of full or part-time special support teaching and-or child care support depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.  In the case of specific learning disability severe dyslexia children who are so assessed will qualify for support under this new initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 and 426 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the reports referred to by the Deputy.  It is calculated that approximately 1,400 of the estimated 1,800 traveller children in the 12-15 age bracket are in receipt of education services, whether in primary schools, second level schools or in junior education centres.</P>
      <P>A key objective of my Department is to increase the number of traveller children benefiting from education provision.  To this end I have already established a representative group to advise me in this area.  As part of last week's budget package I announced that, as an encouragement to second level schools to meet the needs of local traveller children, a new capitation grant similar to that available at primary level will be introduced in 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department recently put in place the eight to 15 year old early school leavers initiative which will run in 14 project areas until June 2000.  The project aims to develop effective strategies for preventing school drop out and for encouraging those who may have left school to return to education. When the project is completed, it is hoped to implement, on a nationwide basis, the strategies which will have been developed.  While these will apply to the whole school going population, they will also be of benefit to achieving higher retention rates among traveller children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that my Department is a partner with Pavee Point in an Integra project which is working to design a strategy for data gathering, data analysis and <Col N="1100" /> decision making so as to, <i>inter alia</i>, facilitiate access to education and training by travellers.</P>
    <P>My Department's visiting teacher service continues to work with traveller families and school management to encourage the transfer of traveller children from primary to post primary level at the appropriate age.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there are 650 traveller children attending post primary schools and an estimated 175 traveller pupils attending junior education centres in the current school year.</P>
    <P>I intend to keep the educational needs of traveller children under ongoing review as part of my commitment to ensuring that the goal of full participation by the children in question is realised.</P>

      <P>The issue raised in the application for special arrangements in relation to the person concerned will be catered for within my Department's overall policy approach to issues which arise regarding the presentation of material for examination by some students.  This means that examiners who receive this candidate's work will be under instruction to mark it reliably in accordance with the marking scheme for the subject concerned so as to ensure that full credit is given for all work done.  Should an examiner encounter a difficulty in ensuring that full credit is given for all work done he-she is further instructed as a matter of policy to refer the work to an advising examiner for his-her attention and consideration.</P>
      <P>In this way my Department ensures that every effort is made to ensure full justice for the candidate during the marking process.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the possibility of injury being caused in schools by such items as laser pens.  It is, at present, open to school management authorities to prohibit the use in the classroom of items such as laser pens if they are considered a safety risk.  Under health and safety legislation (Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989), school management authorities are obliged to carry out a risk assessment with regard to the activities carried on and equipment used in the school classroom.  The Health and Safety Authority has overall responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the occupational safety and health system under that legislation.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) is not an approved college for the purpose of this initiative.</P>
      <P>However, the RCSI is an approved college for the purpose of the higher education grants scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, the State meets the cost of tuition fees for eligible students up to maximum fee limit, which for the 1998-9 academic year has been set at £2,702.  The student to whom the Deputy refers is already in receipt of grant assistance up to the maximum fee limit. It is not possible, in individual cases, to provide any further assistance towards the cost of the tuition fees over and above the maximum fee limit.</P>

      <P>My Department's website plays an important role in enhancing service to its customers by improving access to information and increasing the quality of communication.  It contains such information as contact details, organisation details, press releases, speeches, publications and details of specific initiatives.  The site continues to be developed through the addition of more information and it is intended that databases of circulars, reports, etc will be addressed to it in the context of developments planned under the ScoilNet component of the Schools IT 2000 project which I launched late last year. Enhancements incorporating the provision of e-commerce <Col N="1104" /> services through this resource will also be considered.</P>
      <P>Individual staff members can be contacted through Internet e-mail and staff are encouraged to inform the public of this service.</P>
      <P>At least £500,000 has been provided under the school administration project in each year since 1992 to assist second level schools in acquiring information technology equipment and software for administration purposes.  Schools are invited to participate in the project by way of letters of offer of equipment or software or, more recently, a grant-aid issued by the IT unit of my Department. As a result of this project, over 95 per cent of second level schools now submit their annual pupil return and exam entry applications in electronic form.  In addition, over 65 per cent of schools now also make electronic returns of time-tabling information which is required annually.  It is intended to extend this project into other areas of administration in the future, as resources permit.</P>
      <P>My Department's IT unit has also started to plan for the development an enhanced technical infrastructure to facilitate e-commerce and to cater for the provision of direct access to certain information contained in the Department's databases in the future.</P>

      <P>The management of Charleville national school, Tullamore has alerted my Department to <Col N="1105" /> reports of vermin in the school.  The building unit of my Department has been working closely with the school to identify a solution to the present accommodation difficulties and it has been mutually agreed that a new school on a new site is the preferred option.  The architectural suitability of a proposed site is currently being explored and my Department is liaising with the school and planning authority in this regard.  The school management is aware of the position and is satisfied with the progress being made.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Qustions Nos. 448, 449, 450 and 451 together.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to introduce legislation to strengthen the vocational education sector.  In this context, amendment of the vocational education Acts will be required which will include provision for parental and teacher representation on vocational education committees.  Before finalising legislative proposals, I consider it desirable that the relevant stakeholders in this sector be fully consulted and their views given careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances I do not propose to legislate in an over hasty manner on this matter.  I <Col N="1108" /> expect to be in a position to publish a Bill to amend the vocational education Acts in mid 1999. The enactment of the legislation will depend among other things on the Government's overall legislative programme.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, after the next local elections, vocational education committees will be elected by the relevant local authorities on the basis of the current statutory position which is set out in the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>As an interim measure and in view of the pending legislation my Department will be in contact with local authorities with a view to encouraging them to exercise their powers so as to ensure an appropriate representation of teachers and parents on vocational education committees after the next local elections.  My Department in its consultations with the relevant stakeholders will consider suitable procedures to be adopted for the nomination of appropriate representatives.</P>
    <P>I intend also that the provisions in the amending legislation with regard to statutory representation of parents and teachers on vocational education committees will be implemented from a current date when enacted.  I am satisfied that it will not be necessary to give the proposed legislation retrospective effect as the legislation will dissolve committees established under the 1930 Act and reconstitute them under the new legislation. The precise legal arrangements to be contained in the Bill will of course be subject to the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>Traditionally where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.  However, in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
      <P>For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty which might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to the supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure that problems with readability whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change is operational in nature and as I have already explained does not involve any change in the actual marking of examination <Col N="1111" /> material submitted by students with specific learning difficulties.  Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for <Col N="1112" /> work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>
