      <P>Does the Taoiseach have any proposal in the Finance Bill to change the law with regard to the identification of tax evasion by tribunals? Is the Taoiseach aware of the public outrage arising from the report in today's papers the Mr. Charles Haughey's tax bill has been reduced to zero?  Does the Taoiseach propose to change <Col N="1115" /> the law so that any tax evasion exposed by tribunals can be dealt with by the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has arisen overnight. I have nothing to say except that I understand it is being examined by the Revenue Commissioners in terms of an appeal.  In relation to legislation, the House is aware that the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance have been actively reviewing the existing powers of the Revenue Commissioners to combat tax evasion.  This review involves looking at extra powers relating to access to bank accounts and the examination of the affairs of banking institutions. The Revenue Commissioners introduced legislation relating to this area in 1992 and recently made proposals to the Department of Finance with regard to re-examining this area in 1999.</P>
      <P>I am not replying specifically to this issue because I am not certain of the position.  In terms of the general question, the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, has examined areas it considers requires additional powers under the 1999 Finance Bill.  I am not saying that definitely covers this issue.  This issue is more likely to be appealed by the Revenue Commissioners to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm he is sure this decision will be appealed?  If there is to be any change in the law, can it be changed in such a way to ensure it will refer to the current case of Mr. Haughey?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that this House established the McCracken tribunal which found, as a matter of fact, that at least a minimum sum of £210,000 was given to Mr. Haughey who admitted receipt of that sum, I am sure the Taoiseach will be anxious to agree that it is incomprehensible to the ordinary compliant taxpayer that an appeals process can find that was not a matter of fact, particularly when the recipient admitted receipt of that sum?  To restore some minimalist faith in the tax collecting system, will the Taoiseach arrange, as a matter of urgency, for the Minister for Finance to consult the Revenue Commissioners and, before this House adjourns today or tomorrow, to make a statement on this matter of great public concern?  Otherwise credibility and compliance in the tax system will disintegrate or we will all be seeking to establish tribunals to present our tax cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same matter, is it the case that when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he appointed the appeals commissioner concerned without advertisement and that he is his brother-in-law?  Without in any way reflecting on that man's competence, does the Taoiseach agree that it gives the wrong impression to the public, that the brother-in-law of the Leader of Fianna Fáil should adjudicate on the tax affairs of a former Leader of Fianna Fáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not undesirable and ought the man concerned not have allowed himself to be seized of this matter because of the impression it gives?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The individual concerned, the appeals commissioner, Ronan Kelly, is my brother-in-law.  He dealt with this case, but I had no involvement in that.  He was working in his professional job and he was the appeals commissioner in this case.  In so far as the question of legislation arises, the Minister for Finance is involved with the Revenue Commissioners in examining where legislation needs to be strengthened. In this case the issue involved is whether this decision will be appealed to the courts. Deputy Owen asked if that is definite, I am not sure of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of other questions put to the Taoiseach he was unable to answer the one I put to him.  I asked him if he would request the Minister for Finance to take some time between now and the close of business tomorrow to come into this House and give an explanation in plain English as to how this incredible fiasco has come about.  The ordinary citizen is bemused.  It behoves the Government to at least offer an explanation.  The Taoiseach is not responsible for this action, but he is responsible to explain it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

The Dáil will go into recess tomorrow and the public are outraged by what they have read in their newspapers today.  They cannot believe this decision.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever a matter of this gravity arises, the Taoiseach is briefed before he comes into this House.  I am surprised he was not able to confirm that there would be an appeal.  In a decision of this nature the Revenue Commissioners would have to make an appeal.  Will the Taoiseach confirm later, perhaps at the start of Question Time, that this decision will be appealed as the Revenue Commissioners will be able to confirm that?  This is a matter that cannot be left to fester over the Christmas recess.  For the order of this House, I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that this matter will be cleared today, that this decision will be appealed and that he will give us more information about such legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked this morning if the Revenue Commissioners will appeal this decision. The answer was that the issue of an individual's tax affairs is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1119" /> to pursue, but in cases where a large amount of tax is involved, it is their standard practice to appeal those cases to the courts.</P>

Can I take it from the Taoiseach's failure to answer my question that he is not prepared to make time available to allow the Minister for Finance to come into the House and make a statement on this matter?

      <P>I thank Members for agreeing to consider the Bill so soon after publication in view of the urgency of its main provisions which I will explain in detail in a few moments.  My colleague, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Byrne, will also address the House on this Stage with particular reference to aquaculture and its development.  Both of us will endeavour to facilitate Members in their consideration of the Bill in <Col N="1127" /> the full spirit of co-operation which we hope will be reciprocated in the circumstances.  The record shows the co-operative spirit and deep consensus across the House which succeeded in putting in place the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, which involved major reform of aquaculture licensing legislation which was ably sponsored by Deputy Gilmore when Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed essentially to ensure that, by quickly addressing some legal doubts which have arisen in the light of court judgments since then, the 1997 Act can be operated as intended in providing the aquaculture industry and the public with a clear, transparent and balanced licensing regime.  The precautionary principle permeates the entire Bill.</P>
      <P>Such legal doubts, if not quickly addressed by legislation on the lines of this Bill, could generate a plethora of time consuming litigation which could seriously disrupt further the aquaculture licensing process and put investment and jobs at risk.  That is a risk the Government is not prepared to countenance.  Accordingly, it is the Government's aim through this Bill to avoid further uncertainty concerning aquaculture licensing legislation, rather than sit by and allow legal doubts to develop and fester.  The 1997 Act must, as far as possible, leave no room for further protracted litigation which bedevilled aquaculture licensing for far too long in the past.</P>
      <P>As is clear from what I have said, and from the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum published with the Bill, the particular urgency of the legislation relates to aquaculture licensing.  I now propose to elaborate.  It is only in the past month or so that legal doubts have been mooted with my Department by some aquaculturalists and others, as to whether the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997, achieved what it set out to do in sections 74 and 75.</P>
      <P>Section 74 of the 1997 Act was intended to carry forward, for consideration under the 1997 Act, all undecided aquaculture licence applications for marine sites made since 1980, but under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. Some people have argued that the applications could not be regarded as proper applications in the first place as the Fisheries Act, 1980, providing for designation of marine sites for aquaculture, was the proper framework for such applications, although inoperable where marine sites were not designated under the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 75 of the 1997 Act was intended to carry forward licences for aquaculture in marine sites granted since 1980, under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, or the Foreshore Act, 1933, for aquaculture purposes, as if they were granted under the 1997 Act.  Some people have argued that those licences should not have been granted on the grounds that only the 1980 Act was available for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efficacy of sections 74 and 75 of the 1997 Act has been most carefully considered by my Department's legal advisers in consultation with <Col N="1128" /> counsel and sections 2 and 3 of the Bill have been carefully crafted to remove all such doubts.  My Department's legal advisers have also recommended the replacement of section 11 of the 1997 Act to prohibit, from the date of publication of the Bill, which was 10 December 1998, persons from commencing aquaculture operations pending the grant of an aquaculture licence after due process under the Act.  This section is obviously needed to protect the rights of duly licensed aquaculturalists as well as third party rights generally, and will ensure due process in relation to proposals for new aquaculture operations in accordance with the spirit of the 1997 Act.  The original section 11 could not have been commenced without applying to many of the existing licence applicants of some years' standing who proceeded with aquaculture operations in the reasonable expectation of licensing without the long delays which have arisen because of litigation which culminated in the replacement of all earlier aquaculture licensing legislation by the 1997 Act.</P>
    <P>The bringing into operation of that Act earlier this year was a complex task, requiring the making of a considerable number of statutory instruments and the due establishment of the independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board provided for in the Act.  That has been set up and is now in operation.  Apart from the section referred to, and section 13, all of the Act is now in force.  The question of commencing section 13, which would specify a time limit for departmental and ministerial consideration of licence applications, will be considered as soon as we make progress in processing the very considerable number of licence applications on hands, which is about 600 in total.</P>
    <P>While the urgency of the Bill relates to aquaculture licensing, as referred to in sections 2, 3 and 4, the Government considers that the other provisions in sections 5 and 6 should also be passed into law at an early date.</P>
    <P>Early amendments of sections 12,13 and 14 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, are needed to protect aquaculture and the foreshore generally from unauthorised development and the deposit of harmful and other materials and so on.  This is covered in section 5.</P>
    <P>These are the first amendments to those protective sections of the 1933 Act and are needed to deter deliberate or careless actions inimical to the proper use and enjoyment of foreshore.  The Government is taking a proactive, precautionary approach to ward off unacceptable interference with national resources before serious problems arise.  The penalties proposed for offences are the same as those provided in the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, for unauthorised aquaculture structures and other offences under that Act.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is without prejudice to the fundamental review of the Foreshore Acts, 1933 and 1992, which I have instructed my Department to carry out in the context of preparing new legislation for <Col N="1129" /> better coastal zone management, in consultation with other Departments and statutory and other organisations concerned.  While I am unable at this juncture to predict the content of such new legislation, my aim is to have substantive legislative proposals for Government decision in the course of 1999.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is required to protect from legal challenge long-standing leasing and other arrangements for fishery harbour centre property for purposes not directly related to fisheries, for example, for purposes of local, social and economic development, and to provide for flexibility in addressing current and prospective needs of local communities without interfering with the essential fisheries capacity of the fishery harbour centres.  The existing legislation dating from 1968 is too restrictive for present purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is without prejudice to the fundamental review under way in my Department of the Fishery Harbour Centres Acts, 1968 to 1992, and of the funding and management arrangements for fishery harbour centres.  I will announce proposals for new legal and other arrangements for fishery harbour centres as soon as the Government decides them, I hope early in 1999.  Sections 1 and 7 are standard definition and interpretation provisions which require no further comment.</P>
    <P>I trust that what I have said indicates the importance and urgency of the Bill.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and I will be glad to provide further clarification or elaboration needed by Members to enable them to progress their consideration of this Bill and to assist in its early passage into law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne) Hugh (Wexford) Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>In commending the Fisheries and Foreshore (Amendment) Bill to the House, I am concerned to ensure that we will have aquaculture licensing arrangements which will endure and withstand legal challenge.  We owe that to the aquaculture industry and the general public.</P>
      <P>For too long, there was uncertainty about aquaculture licensing.  I am committed to making the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, work as intended and, therefore, endorse the Government's proactive approach in the Bill to removing legal doubts which have emerged since that Act was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having ministerial responsibility for aquaculture licensing, I am concerned to ensure that all licence applications on hand, about 600, are duly processed as quickly as possible and will ensure that my Department keeps itself in gear to do so. We are committed to processing existing applications to a conclusion in 1999.  Much progress has been made in considering applications, with 90 applications ready for formal decision as soon as this Bill becomes law.  Another 30 applications are being finally assessed by my Department and its advisers, following necessary public consultation, prior to making a recommendation to me <Col N="1130" /> for licensing and the specific conditions to apply in each case.</P>
    <P>The effective and efficient operation of the transparent and balanced aquaculture licensing arrangements at the heart of the 1997 Act is essential in order to allow the aquaculture industry to continue to develop as far as possible in a fully professional and responsible way.  The current direct output of the industry is £58 million per year providing direct employment for more than 3,000 people.  These jobs have to be safe-guarded and consolidated by aquaculture licences which withstand legal challenge.  These jobs are in remote rural areas which might not otherwise be able to create employment.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture industry has to continue to apply the highest standards possible to all aspects of fish farming.  The potential for further growth of the industry is enormous and I will continue my efforts to foster that growth.  Secure aquaculture licensing arrangements are essential for drawing down valuable EU and Exchequer funds for the development of aquaculture operations.  I am particularly conscious of the investment requirements of aquaculturalists and of the financial pressures on them.  I will ensure that licensing decisions will be made as quickly as possible to allow funding to flow to all aquaculturalists with sound business plans for the future and likely to make a significant contribution to output and job creation.  However, I caution that having a licence does not necessarily entitle an operator to EU or Exchequer funds.  Such funds have to be targeted at clear winners.</P>
    <P>I recently appointed the CIRCA Group, a team of top economic consultants, to carry out a strategic study of the aquaculture industry.  This study will identify the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of the industry, and the threats to it.  The study will also make recommendations as to how the aquaculture industry can be secured and developed, with particular emphasis on overcoming perceived constraints on competitiveness. This strategic study, after involving consultation with all key interests in the sector, will point the way forward for this industry to thrive into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I established the Aquaculture Industry Forum to improve communications between State agencies and the aquaculture industry which is largely represented by the fish farming section of the IFA.  To date there have been four meetings of the forum.  I attended the forum's meeting in November and am pleased to report that it is working very effectively and has already covered a wide range of issues, including fish health, safety on fish farms, environmental matters, the public image of fish farming and the operational programme for aquaculture.  All those attending the forum, many of whom are engaged in aquaculture operations on a day-to-day basis, would agree that the forum has been a useful vehicle allowing the industry and State services to exchange views.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1131" /> The forum has set up two expert groups to address two issues which are of concern to the industry at present, namely, the problem posed by infectious salmon anaemia, ISA, in Scotland, and the difficulties experienced in disposing of mortalities after disease outbreaks.  I will continue to support the forum and attend the meetings whenever Government business permits.  I will listen carefully to the views being expressed on all sides.  In this way I intend to remain conscious of the needs and demands of the growing aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, Members will be in no doubt as to my energetic commitment to fostering a thriving and responsible aquaculture industry, while fully respecting the legitimate interests of the general public.  The Bill contains essential precautionary measures to ensure that the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, will work as planned in the overall natural interest.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully recognise the importance of the amendment and the necessity for its introduction in order to ensure that aquaculture licences are issued.  It is regrettable that the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources did not have a consultation with Opposition spokespersons well in advance of the introduction of the legislation.  I welcome the fact that the consultation eventually took place on the day preceding Second Stage.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill was enacted on 14 May 1997.  I pay tribute to the then Minister for the Marine and Defence, Deputy Barrett, and the then Minister of State, Deputy Éamon Gilmore, who spearheaded this Bill through the Dáil.  It was very comprehensive legislation.  It was also hailed as very courageous at the time, and much of the consultative process to frame the legislation was between the environmental lobby and the fish farming lobby.  The Minister is concerned about a legal aspect of the legislation.  It was enacted in May 1997 and it has come as a surprise to all of us that in December 1998 we are focusing on its legislative impact.  Aquaculture interests have been extremely concerned in the interim because, owing to the non-issuing of licences, many of them will find their financial stability suffering because the banks and lending institutions require the legitimacy of a licence to verify the bona fides of an aquaculture company. I hope this legislation will be expedited as quickly as possible because it is in the ultimate interests of the aquaculture industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the introduction of legislation both Údarás na Gaeltachta and BIM have suspended financial assistance to fish farmers.  The Minister stated that section 5 of the Bill will not impact on the coastal management Bill which he hopes to introduce in 2000.  I welcome the recent allocation of £4 million in the budget.  I hope the relevant legislation will come through in 1999 because, given the analysis of the different projects that <Col N="1132" /> have applied for funding to deal with coastal erosion, much of the budget allocated for next year will be soaked up by two or three pressing projects, for example, the project in Quilty, where there is a row of houses on a road in danger of collapsing into the sea, and the Bray project.  I hope that, in the next tranche of funds in 2006, we will get a realistic amount of money for coastal protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to ISA, a disease which has had a devastating effect on fin fish farming in Scotland.  I hope that disease does not spread here.  The Minister mentioned the difficulty of disposing of mortalities in fin fish farming. The aquaculture industry suffered from a bad press during the summer months because of a large loss of salmon in a fish farm in the west. The resulting publicity was not favourable to the aquaculture industry.  At the time the Western Regional Fisheries Board circulated every Oireachtas Member regarding their concern about that outbreak.  Many of my colleagues contacted me to find out what this was about.  Incidents like that do no good for the industry.  Following this outbreak it took a long time for the pathologist at the Department of the Marine to discover that the loss was probably owing to sudden death as a result of disease.  I highlight this incident because it focuses on the environmental aspect, particularly of fin fish farming and aquaculture in general.  That environmental aspect is extremely important.  If we are to co-exist with the wider community and the environmental lobby, the importance of the environmental impact assessment must be stitched into the aquaculture Act.  It is imperative that the aquaculture industry conforms with the guidelines set down.</P>
    <P>There appears to be an ongoing battle of words between the Save our Sea Trout Campaign on behalf of wild sea trout and the fin fish farmers. Concerns have been expressed on many occasions.  Some aquaculture farms run a very fair and efficient operation with the minimum of sea-lice whereas other fin fish farms have quite a high preponderance of sea-lice, thus causing concern for the wild sea trout.  I know the jury is out as to whether this has an effect on wild sea trout, but there are concerns, and those concerns can be allayed only by proper, efficient management of various aquaculture locations.</P>
    <P>The licensing system should be strong and rigid enough to ensure that aquaculture companies conform to what is set down.  If the Department feels there is non-conformity which is damaging the long-term interests of the aquaculture industry, it should not be slow to close down the operation in question if it is warranted.  It is for the ultimate benefit of the aquaculture industry that this should happen.</P>
    <P>We have a golden opportunity in the context of the next allocation of Structural Funds between 2000 and 2006.  Much of the debate focuses on the western counties in terms of Objective One status and enhanced funding.  It is interesting to note that the landscape in those <Col N="1133" /> counties is dominated by aquaculture activity which provides vital jobs in those communities located in remote coastal regions where other jobs are extremely difficult to find.  Given that situation, aquaculture is extremely important.  We have a chance, when the next tranche of funding is given out, to maximise potential in that area. In a recent submission which we received from the Irish Farmers' Association, the section dealing with aquaculture outlines its commitment to putting private investment in place in those locations if funds are forthcoming from the European Union.  This is extremely important.  Given the signals coming from Europe, particularly in regard to farming, it is in the whole area of the marine that there is great potential for growth and I hope that potential is achieved.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his talks in Brussels over the next few days.  I hope we retain the quotas we have.  There is talk of reductions in certain areas.  I know this is an annual ritual which the Minister has to go through in December each year.  In Ireland we have got the wrong end of the stick in regard to the common fisheries policy. Ever since we joined the European Economic Community in 1973 we have been fighting a losing battle.  We have 16 per cent of European Union coastal waters but only 5 per cent of the catch, and our fleet is less than 3 per cent.  We have been left behind, despite the tremendous potential.  The massive Spanish fleets and over-fishing by other countries have denuded our fish stocks and led to conservation policies.</P>
    <P>When the Minister goes to Brussels he is probably fighting for a total allowable catch, trying to build up to at least what we had in the previous year, but he is not gaining.  We will probably have to stitch into the negotiations which are ongoing in the context of 2002 some improvements in our fish quotas and in relation to our fishing industry generally.  The Minister negotiated the Common Fisheries Policy in 1992 when he was Minister for the Marine.  We looked for an increase at the talks in Brussels where we were down to 11 to 1. On that basis, will we get overall approval?  I often wonder about European Union policy if a landlocked country such as Austria has a vote on fishing when it has no fishing industry as such. What is the validity of it having a say on our future potential in this area?</P>
    <P>Under section 6, the Minister referred to the five fishery harbours which are very important.  I know he has plans for their development.  I hope these will be expedited and that the harbours will be transferred to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The Minister is probably anaesthetised to the many parliamentary questions looking for funding for Killybegs and Castletownbere.  Development plans have been submitted for many of those harbours. A great deal of funding is required and there will probably be a mixture of private and public investment.  It is important we get funding for the long-term future of those harbours.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal which is good in this Bill. I welcome the fact that the Minister is trying to <Col N="1134" /> strengthen the original Bill.  We will give our consent if the chairman of the committee wishes us to return early in the new year to expedite the Bill through Committee Stage.  The Minister is aiming to remove the uncertainty about the allocation of licences.  Aquaculture is probably a Cinderella industry within the fishing industry. However, it has assumed a great deal of importance over the years.  As the Minister of State said, it is worth £58 million to the economy and supports about 3000 jobs.  The industry can be strengthened further.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to people involved in aquaculture and they are happy with recent progress, particularly now that the problem of the dumping of Norwegian salmon appears to have receded. They are getting a far better price for their farmed salmon and other products also appear to be doing well.  We welcome and support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  Down through the years, applications from those who wish to become involved in the aquaculture and mariculture industries have been put on the back burner by the Department.  For some unknown reason, progress has been slow in granting licences to people who wish to participate in this valuable industry.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture and mariculture will play a vital role in the economy in the years ahead.  While deep sea fishing has been bedevilled with quotas etc.  there still seems to be an unlimited market for our aquaculture and mariculture products throughout the world.  We are blessed to have clean water for aquaculture and mariculture development.  The standard of Irish fish farm produce is excellent and should be developed and expanded in the world market in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure of this fast growing industry is very limited.  It is very hard to operate in certain areas where landing facilities are completely inadequate to handle the amount of work generated by the industry.  I would like the Minister to insist that ample funding is made available for the development of landing facilities to facilitate this fast growing industry.  Bantry Bay is the Mecca of the aquaculture industry.  The landing facilities in Bantry pier are completely inadequate.  This is a hindrance to the development of the industry in a bay which has thrived so much in recent years.  I implore the Minister to give sufficient financial support to the improvement of landing facilities in that area.  We will not have a vibrant aquaculture and mariculture industry without sufficient infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Aquaculture and mariculture will go hand in hand with other marine activities provided that proper planning and management is introduced. I have no doubt that under this Bill applications for licences will be vetted and copperfastened to ensure that no ill effects will accrue from the development of the industry in regions around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How soon does the Minister think he will be able to grant aquaculture development licences to the 600 people still waiting for them?  According <Col N="1135" /> to the Minister of State much progress has been made in considering applications, with 90 applications ready for formal decision as soon as this Bill becomes law.  Another 30 applications are being finally assessed by his Department and its advisers.  That figure is 120, which is only one fifth of the total amount of applications in the Minister's office.</P>
    <P>I am not happy when I see progressive individuals trying to get started in the aquaculture and mariculture industries frustrated by the lack of attention given to their applications for licences. I know several people who have applied to the Department for licences in the past four and five years.  They are still awaiting a decision.  This is unfair &mdash; it prohibits the person from getting started and denies him any State aid.  This procedure will have to be speeded up.  I do not know why people are held to ransom and not given the go-ahead, provided they satisfy the criteria laid down by the Department, which I know they have done.  That is why I am dubious about the statement made by the Minister of State that he is committed to processing all existing applications to a conclusion in 1999.  I hope the Minister is committed to this as it is the main plank in the platform of this industry and it will enable people to ensure they get their rightful grants from the EU and the Department to develop this industry to its potential.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely and the potential for the further growth of the aquaculture industry is enormous.  The quality of the product is second to none.  With this in mind and this foundation on which to build I see no reason why the industry will not boom in the coming decade.  It is our only hope of cashing in on a lucrative world market for our products.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what developments have accrued from the Minister's visit to China early this year.  Have markets been opened with the Chinese who are very good customers for mariculture products?  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House what progress he has made in this matter. There is no point in visiting China and returning saying a market will be developed.  How much mariculture product has been exported to China? Have we broken into the market?  There is a huge potential market in Asia for our mariculture and aquaculture products.  It is most important that the Minister does not relax his efforts but accelerates them to ensure proper markets are found worldwide and that we tap into them in terms of the very lucrative products we offer.</P>
    <P>Let us hope the Bill will copperfasten the future of this industry and give those who are anxious to develop it the opportunity they have long been denied.  It is with pleasure that we accept the Bill and we look forward to its implementation and the results it will have in the promotion of the industry in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, for the excellent work he did as a Minister <Col N="1136" /> of State in the previous Government in putting through the legislation which this Bill proposes to amend.  I wish to ask the Minister a number of questions, but will await further consultation with other sections of the industry.  I wish to express concern to the Minister at the way in which this legislation has been introduced. Members of the Opposition and Government parties have not been afforded an opportunity to consult with various interests.</P>
      <P>During the last Government I had the pleasure of chairing quite a number of all-party committee meetings dealing with various legislation relating to the industry.  We spent a substantial time in dealing with the report of the salmon task force. As Deputies Finucane and Gilmore are aware, we consulted with every section of the industry across the board.  Pushing through legislation does not afford us an opportunity to do this.  I understand the Minister is anxious to take all Stages of the Bill today or before the Christmas recess.  I would like an explanation as to why this is necessary.  Will he spell out the flaws in the original legislation and explain why the process has taken 18 months?  When was it discovered that 600 applications have not been completed? How long will it take to deal with these applications if the Bill is enacted?  If it took 18 months to recognise that there were flaws in the Act, will it take another 18 months to test this Bill following enactment?</P>
      <P>The Minister, Dr. Woods, mentioned that legal advice was sought.  Was this received from the Office of the Attorney General?  Was the industry consulted?  We did not have time to consult the industry because of the short notice of the Bill. There are many different interests in the fishing industry and it is necessary to consult with the various sectors, as we did in the case of the report of the salmon task force and other legislation brought forward by the Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister might communicate the advice outlining the problems with the Act.  Legal advice which states the legislation is defective, if such exists, should be made available, even if on a confidential basis, to Opposition spokespersons.  In general terms the Bill will be welcomed by Opposition parties if the necessary explanations are given by the Minister.</P>
      <P>When does the Minister intend completing Second Stage if not completed today?  Will if be the first week in January or the end of January? I ask this in the context of allowing us time to have proper consultation with the various sections of the industry.</P>
      <P>If we get a clear response from the Minister and a fair explanation of the reasons for rushing the Bill through, we will support it.  If we do not get these explanations, we will oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised by the contribution of Deputy Bell as the Minister more than adequately spelt out the reasons this extraordinary procedure was being adopted.  The Minister has indicated by his presence and the presence <Col N="1137" /> of the Minister of State that this is a matter of some seriousness and that they and the Department are dedicating much time, effort and personal commitment to resolving what could become, in the Minister's own words, a legal quagmire, generating a plethora of time consuming litigation which would do serious damage to the aquaculture industry.  I, therefore, welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is surprising difficulties have arisen given that the primary legislation is of such recent origin. However, it is better that the Minister resolves what he sees as difficulties likely to lead to litigation before the litigation does the ultimate destruction to the industry.  I was puzzled by Deputy Bell's contribution and by the circumstances which have led us to this situation.</P>
      <P>The aquaculture industry is one on which we have issued policy statements and had discussions on and off for the best part of 15 years or longer. In 1984 it was my privilege to draft the original policy document for my party &mdash; towards a marine policy.  Aquaculture at that time was regarded as very central and as a new and exciting potential. When we consider the extent of our coastal waters &mdash; Deputy Finucane touched on this &mdash; and think of the estuarial waters and the potential given the whole aquaculture environment, it is astonishing that this country has been so far behind in the development of what could be a very important industry.</P>
      <P>The other point which has been validly made is that the more remote parts of Ireland are those which are most appropriate for the development of aquaculture.  This industry should really fit in with our overall desire for better regional dispersal of employment and the proper exploitation of our natural resources and should be a clean industry.  It is somewhat amazing that the legislative basis of this industry and the infrastructure and the architecture on which it is based is really only now being put in place.  It is a very important industry and it is essential that we have a good, solid, firm and cohesive legislative basis for it.  As the problem with the sea trout proves, there are difficulties when we try to take an artificial creation into what is a very natural environment. There is a challenge to ensure that anybody who comes into this industry operates to the very highest standards and that we have the highest standards in terms of product and the environmental and health impact of species introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The complexity of the current situation was well sketched out by the Minister when he referred to the various sections of the 1997 Act. One of the things which struck me forcibly when listening to the Minister &mdash; I go back to Deputy Bell's contribution because it is also the kernel of what he said &mdash; was that we live in an extremely complex society.  We have become a very litigious nation and a positive development may be held up and stymied by the willingness of people to abuse legislation brought in to create a legislative base.  I instance, for example, the very welcome development in recent years as regards environmental <Col N="1138" /> impact statements and greater consultation. The whole process is welcome and proper but it has been subject to considerable abuse -for example, in terms of its impact on infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that he had recently appointed the CIRCA group to prepare a strategic study of the aquaculture industry.  I welcome that move because we have been a little like a rudderless ship in this area.  There has not been a clear cohesive statement of policy on aquaculture.  We find ourselves in difficulties because there has not been such a study.  In the document I produced in 1984, which is a long time ago, it was suggested that there was a need to do some scoping to work out precisely what could be done, what challenges lay ahead and what conflicts arose.  I welcome the statement by the Minister of State in this regard.  It is surprising that we have had the Department of the Marine for a significant number of years but have not had this type of policy statement.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine was one of the great innovations in public administration in the 1980s.  It was adventurous, far-sighted and very much driven by the then Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, who had an intense interest.  However, it has become fashionable to vilify the man and to ignore the good things he did.  One of the good things he did was to drive the idea of a Department of the Marine.  It was very sad that the Department of the Marine found itself so dramatically and at an early stage of its life plunged into the controversy of the rod licences.  That brings us back to the point I made about the CIRCA group and the Minister of State's initiative in appointing a strategy group.  In a new industry such as this, where we will trespass on many areas to develop a cohesive industry, it is important to have a clear statement of policy.</P>
    <P>While on the issue, the Minister knows it has always been something of a bugbear of mine that the Department of the Marine should be just that and not, as it has been, the Department of the Marine Siamese-twinned with the Department of Defence, which was described as the Department of Fish and Ships by a Minister, or the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, as it is now.  There is a need for us to have a clear focus on the marine but that is a debate for a different day.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also mentioned the aquaculture industry forum.  I was pleased when he mentioned he had attended meetings of the forum and intends to continue to do so.  In the context of the SMI committee, there has been some criticism from the industry about the non-operation of the forum, so I am pleased to see it is operating.  I commend the Minister and Minister of State and ask that the Minister of State be an active participant in the forum's work.  It is a place where the various and sometimes potentially conflicting views would be brought together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The Bill, although very specific, affords us the opportunity to branch and touch on one or two other areas, as Deputy Finucane did.  It mentions, for example, the foreshore and, as Deputy Finucane creatively pointed out, it reminds us of erosion. The Minister does not need me to remind him of my concerns about the extraordinary situation over the past two and a half decades during which totally inadequate attention was paid to coastal erosion, particularly because of budgets.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister &mdash; I am pleased to be here in his presence to do so &mdash; who, in the case of Bray, has taken the most proactive role of any Minister.  He dealt with the controversy there in an extremely sensitive way.  He knows of my concern that the coastal protection scheme in Bray will be to the best possible standard.  I know that concern is shared by the Minister, a Bray man who, as he says himself, was reared on the seafront.  He has been very active in ensuring we get the best, which is consistent with environmental protection.</P>
    <P>This raises the issue of the role of local authorities which do not always behave sensibly.  I hope in the weeks and months ahead the Minister will be able to use his good offices and his well-known diplomatic skills to resolve some outstanding difficulties as regards the coastal scheme in Bray.  It is a very important scheme and the Minister has put a huge amount of personal energy and prestige into it.  It is essential that it is brought to finality early and in the most suitable way possible. This Minister's intervention in this matter has been exemplary, welcome and worthwhile and will produce the type of results we want to see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan touched on the possibilities for remote areas as regards aquaculture.  I challenge the Deputy that it is not only the west coast that has possibilities for aquaculture and, for example, fish tourism.  The Dargle River is one of the finest sea trout streams in the country; I am being absolutely parochial because it runs across my back garden.  An adventurous and extraordinary scheme is being put forward by the Dargle anglers and I will be knocking on the Minister's door in support of that scheme in the near future.  I hope it will get an active and positive view from the Department and I know the Minister will certainly give them more than a fair hearing because he always has done so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane also touched on the wider issue of fish quotas which is not directly related to the Bill, although we are talking about the fisheries area.  I commend the Minister on some of his recent actions regarding the fleet, but it is in a frightening state, especially the ancient vessels which comprise the inshore fleet.  Fishermen are not bureaucrats, yet it has become extremely difficult to upgrade the fleet.  Something must be done and I wish the Minister well in that regard in the year ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> Whelk fishing is a small but significant fishery. The Minister knows better than I its significance because of its importance in his constituency. Whelk fishermen made representations to me recently about the difficulties being faced by small operators in entering whelk fishing, specifically as they must buy a white fish quota to gain access.  I understand this is being done to contain growth and preserve the species.  However, many of the people involved are small operators and this requirement weighs heavily on them.  In Britain, the quota for whelk fishing is handled in a manner which does not require the same sort of expensive treatment afforded it here.</P>
    <P>I ask for sympathetic treatment of whelk fishermen for a number of reasons.  Deputy Sheehan mentioned the Asian market which has collapsed. That market, specifically the Korean market, was the lifeblood of this small but important and significant industry.  The price for whelk has fallen to one seventh of its price two years ago, yet people must still buy a white fish quota to gain access to the industry.  That is an onerous requirement. There should be other ways of licensing and protecting the species.  The Minister, who has exercised a good deal of ingenuity in other areas, should turn his brain to this.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I am concerned about the Bray seafront protection scheme is the use of large volumes of shingle from the codling bank which is not as appropriate for dealing with coastal erosion as the scheme the Minister prefers.  I hope he is able to reach an accommodation to allow sense to prevail so that Bray Urban District Council will soon endorse the coastal erosion scheme which the Minister has been to the fore in promoting.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and Minister of State for attending the debate.  Notwithstanding the late hour in terms of the legislative year, if there is a potential lacuna in the law or an area where there will be unnecessary litigation, it is important that it is corrected and the Minister and his colleagues are to be commended for doing that today.  I have the greatest pleasure in supporting the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a general practice in the House to publish Bills two weeks before Second Stage is taken.  That we are agreeing to take Second Stage today indicates the wish of the Opposition to co-operate with the Minister in the advancement of the Bill before us.  However, we have an obligation as the Legislature to examine critically any legislation brought before the House, its reason, detail, content, etc.  Consequently, it would be unreasonable to expect the House to deal with all Stages of the legislation in one debate.  It would be unfair to, and place at a disadvantage, those outside the House, especially those with an interest in the industry, if they were denied the opportunity of passing comment on the legislation and making submissions or observations, either to the Minister or to Members, about the legislation.  I thank the Minister for his <Col N="1141" /> kind remarks about my role and work in bringing the 1997 legislation before the Oireachtas and piloting it through.</P>
      <P>The fish farming industry, which the Bill addresses, is of increasing importance.  It is worth £58 million annually, with 3,000 employed in it, many of whom live in remote locations which might otherwise have difficulty attracting industry. At a time when large companies cease operations and relocate elsewhere at ease if it is convenient for them, the development of an indigenous industry, based on natural resources and appropriate to coastal activity is very important.  The success and progress made in the aquaculture industry over the years is important for the coastal communities it serves.  Apart from the employment aspect and the retention of people in coastal communities it is also important in producing a source of good, nutritious food. The Minister can correct me if my figures are wrong but, at present, fish farm produce comprises about 30 per cent of fish products in Ireland.  The bulk of fish product on fish counters in supermarkets, especially salmon and shellfish, is produced to a high standard on fish farms.</P>
      <P>The development of fish farming is important for another and often forgotten reason &mdash; conservation. Stocks of wild fish are declining.  The Minister is heading to the Council of Ministers meeting tomorrow where he will have to defend our case, and the issue of conservation will be high on the agenda.  As population increases worldwide, the demand for fish grows and the capacity of the fishing industry globally to catch fish using sophisticated technology increases, the demand for fish can be met only by the development of fish farming.  That is a point missed by those who, from an environmental perspective, criticise the fish farming industry.  Growth in the industry is one way in which pressure on wild fish stocks will be reduced.  The development of the salmon farming industry in Ireland has had a major impact on easing pressure on stocks of wild salmon.  If we did not have a salmon farming industry for the best part of 20 years the stocks of wild salmon would be considerably reduced. The Irish fish farming industry operates to a high standard.  For that reason it is imperative that environmental and hygiene standards are maintained to the highest levels and that there is transparency in the licensing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Minister of State at the Department of the Marine the situation I inherited was one where the development of the industry was greatly hampered by the absence of a satisfactory licensing regime.  There was considerable conflict, mistrust and much misinformation about the nature of the fish farming industry.  The 1997 Act put in place a new legislative framework and a new licensing regime analogous to the planning system for developments on land.  Following a period of public consultation, production of environmental impact studies and so on and an initial decision by the Minister, anybody aggrieved by that decision had the opportunity to <Col N="1142" /> appeal it to an aquaculture licence appeals board in the same way as one can appeal to An Bord Pleanála, if unhappy about a development on land.  The Act also provides for the maintenance of high standards of environment quality and so on.  It is complex legislation.  The reason it attracts so much litigation is that this is a complex area. It deals not only with the licensing of aquaculture activity but also with the use of the foreshore and the allocation of portions of the foreshore to companies, individuals and co-operatives to engage in aquaculture activities.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Act was signed into law on 14 May 1997, shortly before the 1997 general election which resulted in a change of Government.  I am disappointed the aquaculture licence appeals board was not appointed and that the legislation did not come into operation until 30 June 1998 -over 12 months later.  This meant the backlog in terms of the number of applications for licences lodged but not processed was causing frustration and difficulties in the industry.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that to date not a single licence has been issued under the 1997 Act.  The Minister may make a case that because of the difficulties he saw with sections 74 and 75 it might not have been possible to issue licences to applicants whose applications were submitted prior to the commencement of the Act.  There are certainly applications which would have been made after the commencement of the Act which should have been capable of being dealt with.  The delay in commencing the Act has had the effect of delaying the issuing of licences to the industry, the absence of which is causing considerable difficulty. For example, one cannot obtain a BIM grant in the absence of a licence.  Also one has difficulty in obtaining finance through banks in the absence of a licence.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled as to the reason this legislation is before us.  I am puzzled as to the reason it was produced so suddenly.  The Smith case which I understand gave rise to the legal doubt about sections 74 and 75 was heard and the judgment handed down on 18 June.  If a problem arose from that judgment I would have expected that action would have been taken before now.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister kindly arranged for a briefing for Opposition spokespersons, for which I thank him and his officials.  We asked to see the legal opinion on which the Minister and the Government arrived at the conclusion that new legislation was necessary.  I understand there is no written legal opinion on which the decision was made to introduce this legislation.  This is highly unusual.  We have many experiences of legislation being shot down in the courts and where new legislation has to be introduced to deal with it. This is the first time legislation is introduced to deal with an apparent legal problem with legislation where there is no legal opinion on which to base that case, where no challenge has been made in the courts to the sections of the legislation involved and where there is no case law on the sections involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> The issue, as I understand it, is that section 74, which provides that applications which were submitted before the Act could continue to be dealt with as applications, is in doubt and that section 75, which provides for licences issued under the 1959 and 1980 Acts, may be in doubt.  Yet the 1997 Act is explicitly clear on both those points. The 1997 Act deems applications made in advance to be applications under the 1997 Act and it deems the licences issued under the previous legislation to be licences under the 1997 Act.  I am aware the issue was raised in the court about the question of public consultation but the 1997 Act explicitly provides for public consultation. For example, it provides that where consultation had not been engaged in, the licences had to be processed under the full terms of the 1997 Act.  If there was a doubt about the extent to which that needed to be tightened up it could have been done by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why this legislation is before us when the original legislation has not been found wanting in the courts.  It was referred to in a court case, but has not been challenged in the courts.  I am not aware of any challenge to it, and as I understand it, there is no formal written legal opinion on which this amending Bill is based.  I am at a loss to know why this legislation is before us.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to section 6 which has nothing to do with aquaculture.  Section 6 is about the fishery harbour centres.  It purports to widen the rights of the Minister to allow activity to be engaged in, other than fishing activity, in the fishery harbour centres &mdash; Killybegs, Dingle, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth.  The Bill gives the Minister the power to have the fishery harbour centres used for &ldquo;any other purpose including the provision, improvement and development of leisure or amenity facilities or for facilitating or promoting the social or economic development of the area in which the fishery harbour centre is located, which the Minister considers advantageous and appropriate in respect of the operation or development of the fishery harbour centre&rdquo;.  It also allows him to &ldquo;sell, lease, let, exchange, grant easements over, <i>profits à prendre</i> in respect of or permit the use of any land so vested for any of those purposes which the Minister considers appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Today's newspapers carry reports of a row in Dunmore East regarding the development of a scheme of holiday homes near the fishery harbour. In my opinion there is potential for conflict in this area because, as the Minister stated, the 1968 Act is restrictive in terms of what can be done in a fishery harbour centre.  On Committee Stage, we will be obliged to tease out the Minister's intentions regarding the provisions in section 6.  There will be considerable alarm in the fishing industry and among fishermen in the five fishery ports in question at any prospect of their fishing activity, and the resources and facilities with which they are provided, being compromised <Col N="1144" /> or used for other short-term or attractive activities.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not object to me voicing my concerns about the situation in Howth.  Considerable concern exists regarding the state of the fishing industry on the east coast and its future.  In light of the provisions in the Bill, perhaps the Minister will indicate the type of activities which will be carried out at fishery harbour centres and the use to which those centres will be put.</P>
    <P>I will not oppose the Bill.  I have expressed my doubts about the necessity for its introduction. The Minister stated that he received legal advice which we have not seen and which was not put in writing &mdash; which indicated that the legislation is necessary.  I am inclined to believe these matters should be dealt with in the House rather than in the courts.  The intention of sections 74 and 75 of the 1997 Act was to admit applications which were already made as valid applications for the purposes of that Act and to validate licences that were already issued.  There has been a great deal of litigation in respect of aquaculture.  I am not anxious that such litigation should continue because these matters should be dealt with in the House.  However, those matters must be teased out during a lively and thorough Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputies Barrett and Gilmore who had ministerial responsibility in this area during the term of office of the previous Government.  I pay particular tribute to Deputy Gilmore who was responsible for introducing the original legislation.  I attended a conference in Westport recently which was also attended by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, and great praise was given to Deputy Gilmore for the courage and commitment he displayed in bringing that legislation through the Dáil.  However, people indicated their disappointment at the Government's failure to take action, for at least 12 months, in respect of the legislation introduced by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As the Minister and Minister of State pointed out, the fishing industry employs more than 3,000 people.  However, there are those who are afraid to support the industry because the people involved in it are Irish nationals.  If they were non-Irish nationals, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and various Ministers would be attending opening ceremonies and providing them with grant aid, rates remissions, etc.  The people involved in the fishing industry are Irish, they are prepared to put their money where their mouths are, to employ Irish people and to take the risk of entering the industry in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are 600 licences awaiting approval from the Department.  I have only been a Member of the House for a short period and the one Department that upsets and annoys me it did so even when my party was in Government is the Department of the Marine and <Col N="1145" /> Natural Resources.  One would need a heart bypass each time one contacts that Department to obtain a reply to a question, a licence, etc., because one is transferred from one official to another without any action being taken.  I hope the situation will improve in the future.</P>
    <P>People in the fishing industry have invested a great deal of money in their businesses.  When they submit applications for licences, requests for information, etc., to the Department, they are entitled to be dealt with speedily.  I would like a charter of rights similar to that which applies to farmers to be introduced in respect of fishermen because their dealings with the Department can be frustrating.  I compliment the Minister for dealing with a recent case about which I contacted him and which involved a foreshore licence for the cable car at Inishbiggle.</P>
    <P>There are never any problems when developers apply for foreshore licences.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources acts speedily in such cases, a fact which upsets me.  Why can the Department not show the same initiative in respect of the operators who depend on the approval of their licences to obtain bank loans and attract investors?  There are 3,000 people involved in the industry but that figure could be doubled if the outstanding licences were granted.</P>
    <P>Given that the legislation will be passed without opposition, the Government and the Minister must ensure that the necessary resources and staff are allocated to deal with this problem.  Licence applications must be dealt with quickly so that people making them are not delayed by being obliged to contact politicians or the Department. If there is a shortfall of staff in the Department, it should be rectified.  Those with responsibilities in this area, regardless of the Department in which they are employed, should be answerable to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and they must also be provided with adequate resources.</P>
    <P>Mr. Richie Flynn from the IFA is present in the Visitors' Gallery.  His organisation is involved in the fishing industry and I compliment it on its recent conference in Westport.  The IFA made a wise choice in selecting Westport to host that conference because the town was able to cater for its needs in terms of hotel accommodation, etc. Many people in the west are involved in the fishing industry and they are good and honest employers and they work hard.  They have gone through a difficult period but they are now getting their act together.  They are hoping the industry will go from strength to strength because many people who would otherwise have been working in New York, London or elsewhere will now be able to work in Achill, Clare Island, Westport, etc.  I hope the resources will be put in place to deal quickly with the backlog of licences. Many people are waiting for those licences to obtain approval for bank loans and to attract investors to their companies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche referred to coastal erosion. There is a major problem in the west.  The Minister <Col N="1146" /> will attend a conference in Brussels in the coming days to discuss quotas and other matters related to the fishing industry.  I hope he will put forward a strong case for Irish fishermen because they endured a difficult period in recent years.</P>
    <P>The problem of coastal erosion should also be discussed.  If it is not dealt with, areas in Achill, Belmullet and Clare Island will be washed away. The problem is getting worse and nothing is being done.  A miserly sum was allocated last year.  The problem will not go away.</P>
    <P>The west should be included in the application to Brussels for Objective One status which I hope will be accepted.  This would be of assistance to the industry and help to attract investment.</P>
    <P>I understand BIM may be given responsibility for harbours.  It could not do a worse job than the Department.  There are many harbours where fishermen cannot land their catch at certain times of the year because of weather or tidal conditions. Our fishermen have been let down, although the grant aid announced recently by the Minister to upgrade the fleet is welcome.  This has been sought for many years.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be successful in the negotiations in Brussels this week on quotas and that we will not have to wait a further 12 months for licences to be issued.  Many have invested and want to invest in the industry but they have to obey the law and abide by EU regulations.  Whatever action has to be taken to assist them should be taken by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Anything that speeds up the process of issuing licences has to be welcomed.  I have one reservation, however, which is shared by Deputy Gilmore.  There are dangers attached to rushing legislation.  I understand there has been consultation with Opposition spokespersons on marine affairs.  I hope there has also been consultation with the industry. A number of years ago prior to the Christmas recess legislation dealing with rod licences was rushed through.  We are all aware of the difficulties this caused.</P>
      <P>It is unbelievable that there are 600 applications on hand in the Department, many for ten years or more.  The Bill amends the 1997 Act introduced by Deputy Gilmore when Minister of State.  He grasped the nettle and his efforts were much appreciated.  He dealt with other fisheries matters also.  He took the courageous step of implementing the recommendation made by various committees and reports that the use of monofilament nets be legalised in salmon fisheries. There has been peace and tranquillity in that sector since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditional or deep-sea fishing has reached its full potential.  Fishermen are subject to quotas and EU regulations.  It is difficult to envisage further development.  I hope the Minister will be successful in the negotiations on quotas in Brussels this week but we are never surprised when they are reduced.  This has a knock-on effect on <Col N="1147" /> economic activity, employment and income in coastal communities in the west.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture sector, however, has huge potential.  One of the great advantages is that employment is created by native entrepreneurs. The people of Donegal are aware of the importance of providing support for home industry based on natural resources, given the events of last week when a huge multinational pulled out leaving 800 employees without jobs and a further 800 by this time next year.</P>
    <P>The aquaculture sector plays an important part in the economy of Donegal.  One of the largest producers of farmed salmon is based in Fanad in Lough Swilly.  The jobs of the young people employed are ensured.</P>
    <P>The 1997 Act was progressive.  It introduced transparency to the issuing of licences.  No one knew what the yardstick was.  This was unacceptable and a source of much frustration. Under the Act a final decision has to be made within two or three months.  If an applicant is unsuccessful, a reason has to be given which may be appealed.  It is disappointing, therefore, that after a year and a half no licences have been issued.</P>
    <P>I am glad the IFA is playing an active part in fish farming.  It has organised seminars to identify the possibilities.  We still lag behind many of our neighbours.  I believe Scotland is far more advanced than we are, and Norway is even more advanced.  We have been slow in coming to grips with the possibilities of this industry.  If even some of the 600 licence applications are granted there will be enormous economic development in the west and around the coast.  I understand 3,000 are already employed with a total income of between £58 and £60 million.  The sooner these licences are issued the better because we have much ground to make up.</P>
    <P>Infrastructural development must take place in parallel with the issuing of licences to underpin the deep sea fishing and aquaculture industries. Harbours must be improved.  I know plans exist for the improvement of Burtonport, Greencastle and other smaller harbours in County Donegal. Aquaculture is often carried on in small coves and inlets rather than in bigger or more prominent harbours.  It is important that proper access and safe landing facilities are provided in these smaller locations.  In my area there are many inlets in the Rosses, Gweedore and Cloughaneely where mussel and other shellfish farming is carried out.  Piers and other necessary infrastructure must be provided in these places to allow safe access in all weather.</P>
    <P>We must engage in the promotion and marketing of fish.  We see what can be done with proper marketing.  The Donegal Catch brand is well known throughout the country and abroad and is an example of good promotion and marketing.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion can have a significant effect on the development of aquaculture and is a problem in many parts of the country, including County <Col N="1148" /> Donegal.  I am disappointed that only £3.74 million is being made available to address this problem in the coming year.  That amount would be insufficient to address the problem of coastal erosion in County Donegal, not to speak of the entire coast.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the recent issuing of 31 licences for the white fish fleet.  These are very welcome and will help the development of that sector of our fishing industry.  However, I was disappointed that a number of young applicants who have trained in the fishing school in Greencastle, received their skipper's tickets and have some experience, were not favourably considered. If the fishing industry is to have a future, young people who are willing to work and keen to make the investment must be encouraged to enter it.  While I welcome the issuing of the 31 licences, I am disappointed that so many young applicants were not successful.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it is enacted and that the logjam in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is released and the licences issued as soon as possible.  If they are, we will see the benefits of investment by Údarás na Gaeltachta and others to bring employment to the west where it is so badly needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled that a Bill which has not been challenged in the courts is now being amended.  I assume there is good reason for doing so.  The Foreshore Act, 1933, the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 and the Fisheries Act, 1980 are mentioned.  Licences have been issued on the basis of the 1959 and 1980 Acts and there is doubt as to their legality.  It is important that the matter is cleared up.  From time to time legislation can be flawed.  Some legal people feel the Landlord and Tenant Act, passed five or six years ago after many months of debate, is flawed and that, under it, a person who lives in rented accommodation for more than three months acquires squatters rights.  That is an appalling state of affairs, but I see no effort being made to amend it.  This is simply one example of legislation which is inaccurate and inappropriate.  None of us disagrees with what the Minister is doing in introducing this Bill.  If an error needs to be rectified, let us do so.  The debate affords us an opportunity to refer to some elements of the development of aquaculture which need attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed in two locations in my constituency in recent years that people have proceeded with projects without an aquaculture licence.  By doing so they have created a number of problems in the locality.  Will the Minister make it clear that if people proceed with an activity for which they do not have a licence, they will be disqualified from receiving a licence for the venture in question for ever more?  I hope the Minister will pay attention to that type of situation.  It is a form of intimidation when a person fills a beach with trestles and seed as though he owned the beach and had a licence for his activity.  One of the locations I refer to is the very scenic area known <Col N="1149" /> as Woodstown strand.  Deputy Byrne can see it when he gets up every morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a beautiful county.  I am very envious of where the Deputy lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a beautiful county, but what is happening there is a serious contravention of the law.  People have proceeded with an activity for which they have no licence.  There has been damage to the attractive beach, local people have been disturbed and people have taken the law into their own hands.  One might accept these inconveniences because jobs have been provided. However, while the area where trestles have been laid is exposed at low tide, at high tide it is the feeding ground for a number of species of flat fish such as plaice, flounders and others.  The area was trawled by local fishermen until the trestles were laid down.  These are metal objects a few feet long and a couple of feet wide.  One cannot trawl in an area where there are hundreds of them.  Until they were laid, a number of local fishermen trawled that fishing ground.  Generations of their families before them trawled it.  Suddenly they find their right to earn a living is destroyed and the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has done nothing about it.  I would like the Minister to comment on that type of situation. If any of us breaks the law, whether while driving on the road or in an infinite number of other ways, we will be quickly called to account, but when people did it in this manner, nothing was done about it.</P>
      <P>There was a similar incursion on the beach at Abbeyside in Dungarvan six or seven years ago when a group thought they could proceed to lay metal trestles on the beach without a licence or reference to anybody.  There was uproar.  When they applied for planning permission, it was refused.  The objections were so numerous and vociferous that it was only a matter of time before it was refused.  One of the darker sides of the acquaculture industry is that some people proceed to do work without any licence.  While I wish the best of luck to those who proceeded to work with a licence, we do not want people to ride roughshod over other people's rights.</P>
      <P>While the aquaculture industry is primarily confined to the west, areas on the south coast have made tremendous progress in recent years. I refer specifically to the Ring Gaeltacht situated five or six miles outside Dungarvan where a large oyster industry has been built up.  Dozens of people are gainfully employed in it and it has been a wonderful boom for the area.  Having regard to small projects like that, bigger projects on the west coast and the deep inlets in west Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo and Donegal, there is tremendous potential for development, but it is important that it should be in an orderly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1933 Foreshore Act, referred to in the Minister's statement, is most interesting legislation. The responsibility of the various Departments and Ministers for the foreshore is complex. <Col N="1150" /> It is difficult to establish where the rights of a landowner start and end.  The definition of a high water mark, an average full tide, leads to many disputes and much uncertainty.  There is a need for the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department which is most involved in this area, to ascertain from people exactly where ownership starts and ends.  Jurisdiction for the foreshore lies with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  The area below the foreshore, the area below low water level, used to be the responsibility of the former Department of Transport and Power, but it is difficult to ascertain which Department that is today.  It may be the Office of Public Works.  The matter of responsibility for the area below low water level is one of concern.  I do not know if the Minister can give a clear definition of the various departmental responsibilities for the different areas.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources comes into the equation somewhat further out.  Three Departments have responsibility for beaches and the foreshore, but the delineation of those responsibilities is not at all clear. There is a fourth component, the owner of the adjacent land.  There are four interested bodies. There is usually an appendix at the end of a Bill which gives a definition of where various responsibilities for areas lie.  I would have liked such a definition to be included in this Bill.  I have never seen that in print.  I do not know if the Minister or anyone else has, but I am sure somebody has.  I do not know if any Member in this House can tell me where responsibilities for these areas lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  It is going after the sleaze market, the tabloid press.  A paper need not be a small size to be a tabloid.  When a paper excludes the Dáil debates and keeps referring to sex cases, it merits the title of a tabloid.  Sleaze, sex, violence and other related matters apparently sell papers. Papers carry out research studies on this and that is what they have come up with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In today's <i>Cork Examiner</i> it is reported that Youghal Urban Council questioned the ownership of the river bed of the River Blackwater. Those fishing rights belong to the Duke of Devonshire, one of whose residences is Lismore <Col N="1151" /> Castle.  They were probably given by a king or queen three, four or five centuries ago.  Much as we may not like it many such fishing rights exist around the country and with our membership of the EU it will be probably more difficult than ever to extinguish those type of fishing rights.  The question raised by members of the Youghal Urban Council was who owns the river bed of the River Blackwater as distinct from the fishing rights and the fish that swim in the river and in the estuary.  I would like the Minister to read the report of the discussion that took place at a meeting of Youghal Urban Council and to ask his officials to inquire into the ownership of that river bed.  Fishing rights may not necessarily mean ownership of solid surface underneath.  It raises an interesting point of law and people are entitled to an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I do not apologise for raising these questions.  I have raised some highly technical questions concerning the three Departments and their responsibilities in regard to the foreshore and the ownership of the river bed.  This is a grey area and these matters are inconclusive.  The Duke of Devonshire may own the fish swimming in the River Blackwater but may not own the river bed.  Who knows what the ramifications or implications of such a finding would be.  It would be interesting to investigate this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 6 refers to fishery harbours and the multiple use of such harbours.  They are not used only for fishing but, as the Minister said in his statement, for social purposes.  The yacht club springs to mind.  This has serious implications because we have many nice harbours and fine fishing fleets.</P>
    <P>The tourism and leisure industry is growing rapidly and many people are wealthy enough to own sizeable yachts and motorboats.  There is great competition for space in those harbours, whether it is Kilmore Quay, Rosslare, Dunmore East or Kinsale.  I agree with the Minister's statement that the social element should be considered. However, many of these harbours are not capable of looking after the needs of competing interests.</P>
    <P>I repeatedly tabled parliamentary questions on the need to expand Dunmore East harbour.  It is one of four designated harbours &mdash; the others are Killybegs, Castletownbere and Howth &mdash; which provide a livelihood and leisure activities for several hundred people.  However, they are not capable of coping with both demands.  The Minister should instigate a new programme of harbour development, such as that initiated by one of his predecessors 30 to 35 years ago which extended and improved those four harbours.</P>
    <P>Howth is a great harbour but time has caught up with it; it is no longer big enough.  There is a marina and plenty of fishing boats but additional employment could be created if the proper infrastructure was in place.  Killybegs is a leading port and a shining beacon for our fishing industry. <Col N="1152" /> However, it cannot cope with competing interests, although they may not be as great as those on the east or south coasts, which are densely populated and affluent, where Irish, British and international leisure craft congregate in huge numbers.</P>
    <P>We need a programme to extend our existing harbours.  Dunmore East is a classic example of the need for such an extension.  People will soon be at each other's throats because there is no room in these harbours to cater for competing needs.  We are not opposed to the Bill which gives us an opportunity to discuss fisheries and related matters.  I ask the Minister to consider the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing this legislation.  The industry was in a tenuous position in that the legal doubts about the licensing procedures for aquaculture were not removed.  This legislation will have an impact on people's livelihoods in areas such as Inver in County Donegal, where the aquaculture industry employs a large number of people.  Some people in the community and the fisheries boards were concerned about this development, but the aquaculture and fin fish industries have been good to my local area.  They have created jobs which would not otherwise have existed as the demise of inshore fishing meant that fishermen had nothing to do.  I hope the Minister will be able to deal speedily with the applications sent to his Department.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an industry in its infancy but we have learned from the many problems it has faced, particularly in the Nordic countries. There is still room for expansion within the existing parameters.  Young people should have access to the development of the shellfish or fin fish industry.  I hope the industry supports those who have taken initiatives to develop small shellfish or fin fish farms and that it looks at the way our fish is marketed.  Unfortunately, the demise of our inshore fishing left many rural communities with little hope, but this industry has given them new impetus, energy and enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for appointing a strategic group to examine the industry.  I look forward to its recommendations on its development and on securing jobs.  I hope the Minister examines competition in the marketing of our finished product.  Concerns have been expressed by the industry about access by non-European countries to the EU market and price reductions which have given an unfair advantage to those selling fish, particularly salmon.  I hope we look at how we promote our products and that we will be able to compete in a more favourable way with non-EU countries in particular.  I hope the strategic group makes constructive points about developing the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must strike a balance between environmental issues and what is right for rural communities in terms of the development of the aquaculture industry.  A number of rural communities rely on <Col N="1153" /> tourism and they feel their concerns should be taken into consideration when designating areas for fish farming in particular.  That balance has been struck through the transparent application process which means people are now aware of what fish farming entails.  I hope the industry continues to co-operate with communities and local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to see that the industry forum has been a tremendous success.  I would hope that such communications between the agencies and the industry will continue because we cannot go on <i>ad infinitum</i> without due regard to all of those who are involved in the industry, be it the Minister and his Department, the processors, the fish farmers, the local authorities and the State agencies. This industry is worth a great deal of money to the Exchequer &mdash; in the region of £58 million &mdash; and there are 3,000 or 4,000 people employed directly or indirectly.  It is not just that this involves revenue to the Exchequer but the fact that the industry has provided employment in areas where it would not otherwise be available.</P>
    <P>I listened to what some Members of the Opposition said with regard to the foreshore and the development of harbours.  As it is the first time we have had any discussions on the marine, I take this opportunity to thank the Minister and Minister of State for their commitment to the development of Killybegs harbour.  A week has not passed since I was first elected to this House that I have not annoyed a Minister and the Department about the development of the harbour at Killybegs.  I am delighted that the Minister and Minister of State have had the opportunity to come to Killybegs on a number of occasions to meet the industry and to look at the huge potential there.  I am delighted that the Minister has obtained funding for the development of the harbour area, which will be of tremendous benefit to our fishermen.  I hope it will encourage other types of investment in enterprise such as oil exploration, exports and leisure.  I thank the Minister for that commitment.  I hope we will be able to work in tandem with all of those involved in the development of the harbour as the premier port in County Donegal.  I must not forget that the Minister also has given great support to Burtonport, the other large harbour area in my constituency.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources has not had the national support which it deserved.  We are a maritime nation, surrounded by water.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not get enough money for coastal protection. As I said once in the Dáil, I hope we do not find a situation some day where Athlone will be on the sea.</P>
    <P>There should be greater support for the Minister's Department because he is talking about a potential which has not really been tapped.  He has provided employment to areas where it would never have been available otherwise.  My constituency is reliant on the fishing industry, be it the small fishermen or the large processing industry <Col N="1154" /> in Killybegs and Burtonport.  Support is necessary for the development of my constituency and that view is echoed all around the coast.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has introduced this legislation.  I hope it will pass speedily through this House and the Seanad, and the Minister will find himself in a situation whereby he will be able to make decisions early.  It is difficult for the industry when it finds that there is a legal quagmire and their licence applications have not been regulated properly.  I hope that once and for all there will be no legal doubts with regard to the granting of licences to the aquacultural industry. I look forward to the huge development potential of this industry.  I will support the industry in my constituency and nationally because there can be a balance between the environmental issues which have been raised on a number of occasions and the employment issues.  I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who spoke for their support for the Bill.  While I congratulated Deputy Gilmore for his work on the Act, I also pay tribute to the contribution of the then Minister, Deputy Barrett.  There were quite a few contributions to the wide-ranging debate.  In some ways Deputy Coughlan summarised it at the end when she said that there is huge potential for aquaculture.</P>
      <P>The legal advice available to the Department states that there is a legal doubt, about which we can all argue.  My officials are aware of and recognise the doubt.  They know the situation as they worked with it for years.  One approach would be to debate how to nail down that doubt.  The simplest course is to introduce legislation which puts the intention of the Government in the 1997 Act beyond any doubt.  That is all I want to do.  I would rather do it now and have done with it.  We could go on discussing that doubt; indeed, now we are taking that discussion into next year.  I am sorry that is happening.  I would have preferred to have dealt with it now.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism that I would like to see the various sections agreed.  The sections are designed only to remove doubt and to back up the existing legislation and to make sure there will be no more delays.</P>
      <P>A member of the Opposition pointed out how litigious people have become.  On the enactment of every piece of legislation there are a half dozen barristers wanting for particular reasons to root around for loopholes.  That results in a delay in development.  There has been far too much delay in development in this area to date.  I am asking the House to go along with me in putting the matter beyond doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane hoped the committee would meet early in the new year before the end of January, when the House resumes.  I will meet tomorrow, next week or the following week.  I will meet at midnight, 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. That is the way I do my work.  I would meet any time.  If the meeting <Col N="1155" /> is to be on Christmas Eve or the following day, I will attend because there are people waiting to have this doubt removed.</P>
    <P>There are people waiting to start their developments. I know that as soon as the Bill is enacted a certain number of licences &mdash; the Minister of State mentioned 90 &mdash; can be issued immediately.  We can all complain about the 600 licence applications which must be assessed but they are all undergoing a thorough and rigorous assessment.  That is what the House would want because that is what was laid down in the Act. Some 90 of those licences are ready to be issued. If after they are issued somebody wants to appeal them, then they can do so because we have installed the appeals system.</P>
    <P>As soon as the party Whips of the committee are prepared to proceed the Minister of State and I will be ready.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane raised the question of the extent of consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine is meeting this afternoon at 4 p.m. It intends only to review its strategy for the year.  I have just discussed the matter with Deputy Gilmore and I do not know how Deputy Bell feels about it, but if the Minister wants to take Committee Stage this afternoon and if the chairman of the committee agrees to take it, I am sure we would be in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is agreed, I would be happy to do that.  I thank the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputies are saying. When there is something we can do and I cannot see any difficulty in it, I would be happy to move on it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and Deputy Finucane mentioned the 90 licences.  I looked at some of these licences and they are in some of the key areas.  The largest number are in Donegal and Cork, where Deputies have been speaking about the importance of providing jobs.  Approximately 100 jobs are dependent on these licences in Donegal.  This only takes 83 of the 90 licences into account. Additional licences which come on stream will lead to further job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane also raised the issue of conforming with EIS requirements and so on.  This discussion shows that I wish to be clear about this issue.  There is a substantial framework.  The 1997 Act is a good and comprehensive Act.  Many people do not understand how comprehensive it is and what it does.  In one way it slows matters as one has to go through all the procedures. However, it also offers an appeals system so people can feel confident that a balanced system exists.  The House or the Government do not want anything other than a balanced system. <Col N="1156" /> Once the system is functioning people will see that it works.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the time taken to produce this Bill.  However, a large number of statutory instruments had to be prepared. Deputies, particularly former Ministers or Ministers of State, will know that this involves a good deal of time and work.  That work has been done by the Department in the interim period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane mentioned the EU Council which is a tough Council.  The reason for this is that there are conservation issues and fishing and over-fishing are constant problems.  The Commission has tabled hard-line proposals on fish stock levels, including cuts of up to 40 per cent in many of the whitefish stocks critical to Ireland. The Commission has also proposed a reduction of almost 15 per cent in the Celtic Sea herring fishery which is a key stock for Ireland.  This will give some idea of what we are up against.</P>
    <P>We have our own scientific data, we have done a great deal of homework and we will fight a tough case.  We will tell the Council that it must strike the right balance between biological and economic concerns, by ensuring the future of stocks while at the same time providing genuinely viable opportunities for fishermen in 1999.  It will continue to be difficult and I thank Opposition Deputies for wishing me well in these discussions over the next two nights.  In fairness to Europe, we have managed to maintain fish stocks and we want to keep fishermen in business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sheehan stressed the urgency of this issue which is important in his area.  He also expressed concern about inadequate landing facilities.  There will be £3 million in the Estimates, some of which I will be able to use to improve landing facilities.  This will be a special allocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not spend it all in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  It will enable us to carry out a great deal of work around the coast which will not be too expensive.  The licences will be completed as soon as possible.  Those that are ready can be issued almost instantly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell was concerned about consultation with the industry.  There has been consultation with the industry.  It feels the best way forward is to put this issue beyond doubt as it could raise difficulties further down the road and we do not want that to occur.  The industry is very supportive and would like to see these measures go through as quickly as possible.  An IFA representative has put a great deal of time into this and can see a great opportunity for development in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roche spoke about the importance of solid legislation.  He was also correct about the litigious society.  He raised the issue of whelks on the east coast.  I am familiar with this issue as many Howth fishermen fish for whelks on the <Col N="1157" /> east coast and I will bear the Deputy's comments in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore comprehensively covered the Bill, the developments which have taken place and the importance of the aquaculture sector. The Deputy must appreciate that it is better to dispel any doubts which exist and that is what I wish to do.  He also raised concerns about the fishery harbours, including Howth.  Many of the things we have been doing could now be in doubt. For example, Howth Sea Angling Club has a facility in Howth and there is doubt about its position.  Scouting Ireland has a facility on the pier in Howth and people with disabilities must also be catered for.</P>
    <P>In the strictest interpretation of the legislation as it stands, I would not be entitled to lease facilities to such organisations.  The Howth Yacht Club is involved and there is an ESB substation.  Dublin Corporation has sewage pipes in the area and is given various rights of way.  These issues are now being brought into question, including the facilities provided by Fingal County Council in conjunction with the Department.  I am sensitive about the harbour and the importance of maintaining the fishery harbour.  The fishery harbour in Howth is separated from the rest of the harbour so it is clearly designated.  However, this would be a problem in other areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised the issue of developing harbours.  He is conscious of this issue because of Dunmore East.  This is an overall problem and it is up to us to come up with proposals for the development of harbours.  It is to the credit of successive Governments that harbour developments are taking place.</P>
    <P>I welcome the relevant, searching and thorough comments of Deputies.  It is clear that all sides wish to see the aquaculture industry developed in a sensible and balanced way and to see these matters put beyond doubt.  A suggestion has been made that we move to Committee Stage this afternoon and I will follow that suggestion.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if, further to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 10 and 11 of 14 October 1998 on the strategic management initiative, he has finalised recommendations on regulatory reform, financial management and information technology to put before Government for consideration; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the strategic management initiative sets out a wide-ranging programme for change in the Civil Service. It is based on a number of key elements including regulatory reform, financial management changes and changes in relation to information technology.  Working groups were established in respect of these issues and these groups have now reported.  Their recommendations are being considered by the Implementation Group which is responsible for developing an integrated programme of change.</P>
      <P>The report of the Working Group on Regulatory Reform has now been considered by the Implementation Group which has set out a programme of action to help ensure that the level of regulation in the economy is appropriate.  I am currently finalising detailed proposals which I expect to be able to put to my colleagues in Government for decision early in 1999.</P>
      <P>Regarding financial management, the recommendations of the working group will be considered by the Implementation Group at its first meeting in January and the group will then report to Government setting out a programme of action.  I envisage Government consideration early in 1999.  As I indicated in my reply to questions on 14 October last, changes have already been introduced in the multi-annual budgeting and administrative budget aspects of financial management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the recommendations contained in the SMI Working Group Report on Information Technology have already been taken up in the work of the interdepartmental Implementation Group on the Information Society.  This group's report, which covers a wide range of issues, including electronic government, will be presented to Government shortly.  The remaining recommendations will be considered by the Implementation Group, also in January, in the context of completing the SMI programme of action on information technology.  I expect that its report will be submitted to Government early in 1999. <Col N="1159" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not yet been put to Government.  The decisions are all about attempting to reduce red tape in Government, continuing to improve the quality of service to the customers and clients, and critically reviewing existing regulations to ensure that we do not have measures holding back quick decision making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to those who drafted the report, they have put forward many practical solutions, but it is a question of the Government ratifying those.  They have looked at existing regulation throughout Government and have given a critical analysis where they believe we should make alterations.  It is for the Government to make that decision and then for it to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not publish the report before it is considered by Government?  Regulatory reform is something on which every Member of the House would have a contribution to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be published as soon as it is discussed by Government.  Most of what has been pulled together in earlier reports in the SMI process is already in the public domain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with publishing this before the Government considers it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government usually clears reports, departmental memoranda and so on before they are published.  This is no different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is the kind of process with which Deputy Bruton, the Taoiseach and I are familiar, the content of the report would not be changed by any Government discussion or by bringing it to Cabinet.  However, the Government discussion could be considerably better informed if the report were published as soon as it is ready. The Government in its discussion and in any subsequent action it might take could have regard to the discussions that take place.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that in a matter of this kind, which is not partisan, the report should be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply to a supplementary question on 14 October included reference to performance related pay.  At that stage the Taoiseach stated that discussions were taking place in the Civil Service relating to this and that he expected to have an additional report and substantial progress to be made before the end of this calendar year.  Can the Taoiseach indicate the present position in <Col N="1160" /> relation to the implementation of performance related pay for the Civil Service?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On regulatory reform, that has been considered by the Implementation Group who set out a programme of action to ensure that the level of regulation in the economy is appropriate. Detailed proposals will go to Government. I do not think it unreasonable that their work should be considered by Government.  Many of the proposals will be implemented.  All of this information was pulled from the departmental reports which came out in May.  Those reports have been refined to some extent by the Implementation Group.  This has being going on since 1994 and what we are trying to do is pull it together through the Implementation Group which is a group of high level civil servants, mainly Secretaries-General, who are trying to make sense of it all and put it before Government in such a way as to enable it to be processed for implementation in the various Departments. What we are currently doing is getting information from all the other areas in the context of regulatory reform, information technology, financial systems and so on, in an effort to make decisions on them.  People should not feel there is any great secret in regard to the matter.  I do not think there is.</P>
      <P>On the second issue, an amount of work has been done this year in the area of performance management.  That and human resource management is what the Implementation Group spent most of 1998 working on.  It has worked up some models which I have begun to discuss with the social partners.  We are due to have a meeting before Christmas or shortly after with the Committee on the Public Service to discuss these.  It will be difficult but at least we now have the benefit of a very detailed analysis by the Implementation Group on how this can work.  It, as a committee, believes it is a working proposition.  I look forward to discussing it with the Committee on the Public Service to see whether we can make progress in this area.  It is a new area but much of the work being undertaken has been tried and tested elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that the Implementation Group to which the Taoiseach refers, or an associated body under that broad aegis, now has a concrete set of proposals for performance related pay in the Civil Service and that those proposals are being put before the Civil Service unions or Congress for consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is basically correct.  I do not want to get into a position of dictating this because it is a new area, but we have a proposal for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say in my reply that the report is what the Government is considering. I said a memorandum was being prepared on what will go before Government.  I cannot give the decisions made until the Government discusses it.</P>

      <P>I have answered questions on the areas of the National Competitiveness Council reports which relate to my office on many occasions.

      <P>Is it the case that the National Competitiveness Council reports to the Taoiseach and not to another Minister for a particular <Col N="1162" /> reason?  The reason is that its reports cover the entire range of Governmental activity.  The only Minister who covers the entire range of Governmental activity, apart from the Minister for Finance, is the Taoiseach.  Therefore, if answers are to be given on the National Competitiveness Council report, the appropriate person to answer is the Taoiseach.

      <P>The work of the Department of the Taoiseach involves, to a significant extent, the initiation and co-ordination of strategic cross departmental initiatives and this is reflected in the Department's statement of strategy.  The Department sees itself as working in partnership with other Departments, offices and agencies in carrying out this role.  This necessitates close relationships and a high degree of cross departmental co-operation with them.</P>
      <P>The announcement by the Government on 13 October that it had agreed to commission a feasibility study for the development of a stadium for the new century is an example of such an initiative. The concept for the stadium involves a design and quality that makes an inspirational statement about Ireland and the aspirations of its people as we enter the new century.  The nature of this high prestige initiative is such that it will require cross departmental and cross organisational co-ordination and my Department is best placed to do that.  As the Deputy knows, my Department is already taking a lead role in relation to the millennium, again reflecting the cross organisational nature of the approach.</P>
      <P>There will be a significant time commitment involved and the official concerned has undertaken this task in addition to his normal duties. The question of any additional resources will be kept under review as the project proceeds.  The commissioning of the feasibility study has commenced and will involve additional costs to my Department.  To give any indication of these costs at this time would prejudice the tendering process.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for providing the information so promptly.  Is it possible to get precise figures from our colleagues in the UK in relation to Northern Ireland's trade with the Republic?  It seems the DTI and other Departments keep such statistics on a regional basis.  We have been amazed over the years, and historically it is understandable, at the tiny volumes of trade between both parts of Ireland, amounting to 3 per cent of GDP.  Does the Minister see a special role for the proposed new North/South body in relation to more strongly developing economic links between both parts of the island, particularly in light&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The common organisation of the EU sheep market provides for free circulation in both live animals and meat.  Under EU regulations, all sheep for export must undergo a health inspection within 48 hours prior to loading and must not show any signs of clinical disease before being certified. Advance notice must be transmitted to the authorities in the importing member state under the EU animal notification system, ANIMO.</P>
      <P>All sheep presented for slaughter at EU approved plants supervised by my Department are subject to veterinary examination and are accepted for slaughter on the basis of freedom from clinical signs of disease.</P>
      <P>As regards imports from Britain, the position is that sheep for slaughter, either directly or through Northern Ireland, must be accompanied by an animal health certificate signed by an official veterinary inspector and be assigned to a particular slaughterhouse.  Under the ANIMO system of animal movement, 10,800 sheep were notified as imported from Great Britain from 1 June 1998 to the end of November 1998.</P>
      <P>Since November 1992 a bilateral arrangement has existed between my Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland, DANI, in respect of sheep going to and from Northern Ireland.  Under the arrangement sheep of Northern Ireland origin may move freely from here and vice versa.  A recent importation of sheep from England has resulted in movement restrictions being imposed in a number of locations here.  The matter is still under investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to comment on the fact that many people, particularly sheep producers, believe over 20,000 sheep and out of State lambs per week have been imported in recent months, at a time when the sheep trade has collapsed?  It is a most unusual activity, particularly in this season.  Will the Minister assure the public that the sheep entering our State from Great Britain &mdash; I am not talking about Northern Ireland &mdash; meet the strict veterinary controls laid down?  Does he regard it as suspicious that many lambs find their way into meat factories in the dead of night?  It is difficult to understand how the veterinary controls about which the Minister spoke can be put in place if animals are being brought in at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton. We have an adequate amount of high quality produce in Ireland, not only sheep and lamb but also beef, pigmeat and poultry.  It is disappointing that a number of organisations feel it incumbent on them to import those products.  There is an adequate supply and there is no need for this level of imports.  However, as far as the Department of Agriculture and Food is concerned, the number which it has found is 10,800.  Recently, Department staff at sheep slaughtering plants <Col N="1170" /> were asked to check any specific evidence of any trade above the level to which the Deputy referred but they have found none to date.</P>
      <P>Department staff have also been reminded that the origin of animals for slaughter must be established so a watchful eye is being kept on the matter. There is freedom of movement under the controls I described.  Ireland is a major exporter of many of those products &mdash; up to 85 per cent or 90 per cent.  However, I repeat it is disappointing that a number of organisations feel it incumbent on them to import such a high volume of those products naturally produced in Ireland.</P>

      <P>One would have to take it from the Minister's reply that he does not believe the low official figures as regards imports from Great Britain.  I have no trouble with free trade. Is the Minister satisfied that his veterinary inspectors know the state of origin of all the out of state sheep and that they meet the veterinary criteria laid down?  How will they know from where animals come if they are delivered to a factory in the middle of the night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the figure of 10,800 from 1 June 1998 to November 1998 produced to me by the Department.  However, under the bilateral arrangements with the North of Ireland sheep going to and coming from there can move freely between both parts of the country.  It would be impossible to ascertain the number coming from the North of Ireland which originated there. Those from outside the North of Ireland and from any EU member state must have certificates of origin and disease certification as well.  Following a well advertised television programme on one plant here, I instructed officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food at various plants to be even more vigilant and to further tighten up, if that is deemed necessary.</P>

      <P>Under the current Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry £133 million was made available for the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes.  However, due to the extremely high level of demand, it was necessary to suspend the acceptance of new applications for the control of farm pollution scheme on 27 April 1995 and the dairy hygiene scheme on 4 October 1996.  Since taking office I have secured an additional £44 million for these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional £25 million, all from the Exchequer, was provided from the on-farm investment schemes in my Department's Estimate <Col N="1171" /> for 1999.  This brings to £36.5 million in total funding available for these measures next year. This funding will allow my Department to meet all outstanding commitments and will allow the introduction of the nationally funded schemes for the control of farm pollution and the improvement of dairy hygiene schemes in a more focused form, better targeted towards farmers most in need of assistance in line with the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The introduction of these schemes will also facilitate some farmers to gain access to the REP scheme.</P>
    <P>The new schemes for the control of farm pollution and improvement in dairy hygiene standards, as nationally funded schemes, are regarded as State aids and will have to be approved by the European Commission before they can come into operation.  Before submitting plans to the Commission, my Department has had discussions during the past week with the main farming organisations to enable their views to be taken into account in the drawing up of the terms and conditions of the new scheme.  The organisations concerned have promised to forward detailed written submissions on the preliminary proposals discussed and these submissions are expected later this week.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but we are still no nearer a starting date.  This reminds me of the installation aid scheme.  Will we go down the same road in relation to the introduction of these schemes?  Some people have said to me it could be mid-summer before these schemes are introduced.  Is the Minister satisfied that the money provided will make a meaningful contribution towards them?  I welcome the fact he has secured an extra £36 million for the introduction of those schemes.  Will the rate of grant be reduced from 60 per cent to 40 per cent?  Will there be limits in relation to off farm income activity?  Is the Minister satisfied the amount of money provided is adequate?</P>
      <P>We had 18,500 applicants for the old control of farm pollution scheme so the number availing of any new scheme could be about 30,000.  It is unlikely that more than 2,500 will qualify for the new scheme; likewise with the dairy hygiene scheme whereby almost 8,000 applied.  How many people does the Minister anticipate will participate in those schemes once announced?  I know he is in the midst of negotiation with the farm organisations.  Realistically, will those schemes be introduced in March or April?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is impossible to say exactly when they will be introduced because I do not have that <Col N="1172" /> within my gift.  The Deputy mentioned the installation aid scheme for younger farmers.  That scheme was held up and I and the Department would have been much happier had it been introduced more quickly.  The Deputy knows the reason it was held up.  The Commission did not want to consider applications in the pipeline but eventually we succeeded in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the control of farm pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes, we are having consultations with the farming organisations at present.  We hope to reach agreement and the farming organisations are expected to send in detailed proposals by Friday of this week.  I hope to be in a position to send the proposed new schemes to Brussels before Christmas.  Approval will be needed from Brussels because they are regarded as direct aids and taxpayers' money will fund them.  I hope they will be established as early as possible in the new year because, from spring on, farmers will want to carry out improvement works.  I would give a firm commitment were I able to but it is subject to Commission approval.</P>
      <P>An upper limit will apply to the schemes and I suggest a 40 per cent rate with account being taken of all farm income.  We want to focus on people who are most in need.  Members will recall that there was front loading on the control of farmyard pollution scheme, dairy hygiene scheme and scheme of installation aid.  I was responsible for that as much as anyone else because I was Minister in the early 1990s.  The result was that money ran out and the schemes now rely on Exchequer funding.  With more focused schemes agreed with farming organisations and the £30,000 expenses limit of the Department of Finance for farmers in the tax net, I envisage almost all farmers receiving some degree of assistance under these schemes.</P>

      <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food is in the process of drawing up the details of the new nationally funded schemes for the control of farm pollution and improvement in dairy hygiene standards which will be targeted at those farmers most in need of assistance.  Meetings have recently taken place with the various farming organisations to enable their views to be taken into account.  The organisations concerned have promised to forward detailed written submissions on the preliminary proposals for the new schemes and these are expected later this week. <Col N="1173" /> The terms of the new schemes will then have to be finalised and sent to the European Commission for approval before they can come into operation.  I hope to be able to launch both schemes in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>As regards the scheme of installation aid, a revised national scheme focused on those farmers most in need of assistance has been approved by the European Commission.  The scheme is in line with the previous scheme of installation aid. However, to target the scheme at those most in need of assistance, farming enterprises with a labour requirement of more than three man work units will not qualify for aid.  I expect application forms, along with full details of the new scheme, will be available in local offices of the Department within the next two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There are export refunds, aids to private storage and a food aid programme for Russia which uses about 100,000 tonnes of pigmeat.  The export refund system in place is liberal as are the aids to private storage, yet there has been no great uptake here.  I have presided over meetings with curers and producers to encourage them to become involved in private storage and export funds but they have not reacted accordingly.  Much the same is happening in the beef sector.  The crisis in the north of the country has been identified as being caused by a lack of slaughtering facilities and by developments in other parts of the island.  We issued licences to smaller operators to combat that.  This means the number of pigs killed has increased substantially in the past three to four months.</P>
      <P>However, the problem is worldwide and is not specific to Ireland.  Reports in yesterday's papers said production had not reached its maximum in Holland and Denmark, our major competitors. There are about four million pigs in Ireland. North American production will not have reached its peak until March of next year.  The Korean and Japanese markets have dried up due to a lack of finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am leading to it.  It was suspended previously at a time when there was a crisis in the industry.  The crisis now is of far greater proportion. I am not laying the root cause for that at the Minister's door, it is an international crisis. This levy was suspended previously.  If Commission approval is required and if a sufficiently energetic case is made to the Commission, I have no doubt it would grant a concession.  When the Minister was on this side and there was a crisis in the pig industry, he lambasted the film &ldquo;Babe&rdquo; because he was of the opinion it would affect consumption of pork products.  Is he aware that RTE intends to show the film during the Christmas season and, if so, perhaps he will make representations to RTE?</P>

      <P>For the pig farmers in the Munster area about whom the Deputy is concerned, we have had long extensions of kills by the plants which were influenced by the Department of Agriculture and Food and the pig producers. We have started the kills to alleviate the <Col N="1176" /> problem.  The aid to private storage has been an attractive scheme for pigmeat but it has not been taken up to any great effect to alleviate the problem. Some £100,000 worth of pigmeat is going to Russia as food aid.  Russia took approximately half of the pigmeat of Europe up to the July crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been disappointed with the level of cattle prices being paid by meat factories this autumn, particularly in view of the more effective intervention support arrangements which I successfully negotiated with the EU Commission last October and in view also of a 9p per lb.  increase in export refunds.</P>
      <P>Following agreement by the Commission to my request for wider and more effective intervention supports, I held a meeting with the beef processors on 14 October and followed this up with a further meeting on 15 October at which farmer representatives also attended.  The objective of these meetings was to ensure that the new support measures would translate into immediate benefit for beef producers.</P>
      <P>While I have indicated my continuing dissatisfaction through my public pronouncements with the level of prices paid by meat factories and I am disappointed that the full benefits of the concessions I negotiated are not being used in such a way as to benefit producers to the maximum degree possible, I am satisfied that without these concessions cattle prices in Ireland would be far lower than at present.  The reality is that cattle prices were in virtual free-fall before these measures were introduced and a huge backlog of cattle was building up on farms.  Since the introduction of the measures, cattle prices have increased by approximately 2 per cent and the backlog of cattle has been more or less removed. It is clear, therefore, that the concessions have been effective in protecting Irish farmers from the worst effects of the loss of the Russian market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless I accept the loss of the Russian market will continue to have a negative impact on the Irish beef market into 1999 and, in view of this, I made timely and strong representations to Commissioner Fischler for an extension of the special intervention package for a further three months.  The Commission agreed last Friday to extend the special intervention arrangements up to 1 April 1999.  I expect the package to be translated into realistic market prices for producers who are incurring high production costs in wintering cattle.  In the context of the prices package <Col N="1177" /> earlier this year, I secured the extension of the deseasonalisation premium at a lower rate for 1999.  This concession will be of particular assistance in the new year to winter finishers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>While I acknowledge the Minister's bona fides and the efforts he has made, nobody else in the marketplace acknowledges them.  So far as I am concerned the factories have made no effort to find alternative markets.  They forced the Minister to secure the various concessions which he sought.  Given that the Minister has not met the factories in the past two months he should call them in because they are fobbing him off.  Why does the price of cattle always fall in a coincidental fashion?  Why is there no competition? The free marketeers told us that intervention by any State agency was to the detriment of an industry.  Is it a coincidence or is it that a cartel is now operating?  Has the Competition Authority not been able to investigate what is happening at the marts?  Has any effort been made to find out what is happening?  Winter fatteners have told me they are in the land of no hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that part of the problem in relation to poor cattle prices is the grading issue?  Have there been any reports back from the factories to suggest the standard is becoming more acute?  What is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cattle prices are extremely low. The actual price is 74p to 81p or 82p per lb.  which is below the cost of production for many people. Winter fatteners are particularly badly hit because in most cases they do not avail of the ten month or the 22 month premiums.  They are going through a particularly bad time.  The Deputy asked specifically what a Minister for Agriculture can do in relation to the factories.  This is a problem because the Minister for Agriculture and Food does not fix prices.  My predecessor referred this matter to the Competition Authority which did nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> On the question of grading, I am aware of dissatisfaction with grading and that it is subjective. Efforts are being made to have an objective mechanical system of grading but more research is needed.  The scheme works well in Denmark but we have a different type of cattle in Ireland. I am aware from work in the dairy industry that when people had difficulties with butter fat and protein levels, automatic equipment was introduced, 20 or 25 years ago, and Teagasc did very useful work in modifying that equipment to suit Irish conditions.  By and large the dairy industry is satisfied with the system in place there.  Perhaps a similar system could be put in place in meat factories which would allow for an objective rather than a subjective assessment in relation to grading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier that his predecessor referred this matter to the Competition Authority but, unfortunately, without results.  I appeal to the Minister to again refer this matter to the Competition Authority because there is justified anger among members of the farming community regarding the scandalously low prices that have been paid for beef for a considerable period.  There was no justification for the price of beef not being increased by at least 6p per lb.  in view of the increased buoyancy in the trade throughout Europe, the introduction of export refunds and the availability of the intervention system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in recent months certain measures were put in place and negotiations brought certain improvements.  However, those improvements were not reflected in the price on offer to farmers.  Members will recall that when the deseasonalisation premium was introduced on 1 January last the price to farmers immediately decreased by between 3p to 4p per lb.  This amount represented the approximate value of the premium.  It will be interesting to see what happens after 1 January next when the new deseasonalisation premium is introduced.</P>
      <P>I again point out the limitations of the Minister for Agriculture and Food in respect of fixing prices.  I raised this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, and Members will be aware from media reports that he has met supermarket representatives and made contact with the Competition Authority.  I am following up on this matter in the most strenuous manner possible because, at present, the industry, the Department, taxpayers and the factories need the industry to supply the raw material.  I will make every effort to ensure transparency in terms of the pricing of the raw material by the factories.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the Minister's achievements in terms of intervention, I cannot be as kind to him as previous speakers. The Minister and the Government have not invested any Exchequer funding to resolve this <Col N="1179" /> problem.

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has the Minister been so quiet in the two months since the crisis emerged?  There has not been a peep out of him, he is like a church mouse.  Given that they know the underlying situation is so bad, farmers are wondering what the Minister is trying to do.  The Minister stated that there is no greater critic than he of the factories.  However, factories will always act in the way they have and this is not the first occasion on which they have acted in this way. The Minister should not have expected that they would not do it when they got the opportunity.</P>
      <P>What action is the Minister taking in respect of the Libyan market and will that market be reopened?  We can discuss the Competition Authority until we are sick of doing so but most of us want to know when the Libyan market will be reopened.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister in a position to indicate why the factories took up only 12,000 or 13,000 tonnes of the allowance of 44,000 tonnes he obtained in respect of intervention?  What happened to the remainder?  What is the European Union's policy in respect of such behaviour?  Why did the factories not take up the amount to which they were entitled?  What sort of case did the Minister put forward in Europe in terms of returning the winter slaughter premium to its full rate?  If winter fatteners are to be given assistance, surely that was an ideal way to obtain a top up.  What a time to allow the premium to be reduced.</P>

Following an invitation, a high level delegation from Libya visited Ireland in July and signed a protocol to reopen the trade to that country for live cattle. That formal agreement between the Government and the Libyan authorities was subsequently endorsed by the Libyan People's Assembly in August.  It was expected that the trade would reopen in October.  At a meeting in the Red Cow Inn a prominent person announced the reopening of the trade from 10 or 12 October.</P>

However, I secured a package at this year's prices council meeting in Brussels in June in order to have the deseasonalisation premium paid at 60 per cent of the normal rate.  I consider that a valuable concession to beef farmers for the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Measure 5 of the REP scheme and agri-environmental specifications set out the objectives to be achieved with regard to hedgerows. Among the objectives is the management of hedgerows on a phased basis to encourage their development with a diversity of height, stages of growth and form in the interests of wildlife, stock control and scenic appearance.  The specifications set out recommendations on the management of hedgerows for healthy growth and good quality, including those that require rejuvenation.  A management option is to leave quality hedgerows in place with maintenance confined to the control of invasive species, inplanting and stockproofing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make the specifications more explicit measure 5 is being reviewed.  I will issue the revised specifications shortly.  I am confident they will address the concerns which have been voiced about the implementation of the measure.  Pending the issue of the revised specifications my Department has issued a circular to all approved REPS planners advising them of the revision to measure 5 and, pending its distribution, requesting them to bear in mind that quality mature hedgerows should be retained in their entirety with maintenance confined to inplantings, <Col N="1183" /> the control of invasive species and stockproofing when preparing or reviewing REPS plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged by the Minister of State's reply.  Is he aware that the current practice results in the killing of established whitethorn and other common hedgerow trees?  Has the Department calculated the mileage of hedgerows exposed to measure 5?  How many hedgerows have been dug up, rooted out or flailed under the current scheme?  Will the Minister of State commission an environmental impact study of the effect of measure 5?  Is this part of the review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 5,600 square metres of hedgerows per farm in excess of 40 hectares. There has to be some cutting of hedgerows to protect county roads in particular which are subject to water damage.  Many complaints have been received that the wing mirrors of school buses and creamery lorries have been broken by over-hanging branches.  One has to use one's common-sense. The planner devises an annual programme indicating the location of hedgerows and the length in metres and specifying the precise maintenance works required.  Measure 5 specifies the machinery to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the changes to measure 5 take effect immediately or will they be introduced on a phased basis next year?  Change is needed.  I cannot argue with the Minister of State that one has to be sensible about the cutting of hedgerows along roadways but it is necessary to avoid a situation where in townland after townland they look like box hedges.  They should appear natural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  Much of it is like the dinky toy matchbox system, it looks tidy and neat but it does not ensure healthy growth.  The changes to measure 5 will take effect at the commencement of annual plans.  The intention is to allow trees to grow and to be trimmed at the sides to provide stockproofing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>

Is the Minister of State aware that there is a hedgerow management project in County Leitrim by Crann which has proved successful?  This is a model we could pursue.  Is the Minister of State aware that the songbird population is diminishing?  This is a source of much concern.  I thought the purpose of REPS was to protect the environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A circular was issued to approved <Col N="1184" /> REPS planners on 2 December.  The specifications will contain a detailed annex in which suitable native hedgerows will be identified emphasising their characteristics and suitability for certain sites.  It will also deal with maintenance. For example, my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food would be extremely concerned that the image of west Cork would be damaged if fuchsia were removed from the ditches there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is reviewing the REP scheme.  I am aware of a number of farmers in County Galway who have been penalised under the current conditions of the scheme.  In one case a farmer suffered a penalty of 25 per cent because he did not cut back a hedgerow.  When the review is carried out, will the Minister investigate the cases of these farmers? They are working with their planners and it is unfair that they are being penalised because they did not cut back hedgerows.  Will these cases be looked at when the review has been completed?</P>

We have all seen the improvements that have been made.  Like Deputy Connaughton I am a participant in the REP scheme and I am aware of the natural wildlife that has returned to my area as a result of it.  The issue of hedgerow conservation is being considered by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and the development of a national bio-diversity plan is being considered in the context of the amendment of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  It is anticipated that the Bill will be published in the next Oireachtas session.  There will be cross-compliance between two organisations who will examine the question in the overall scheme of things.  The Bill will be extremely useful and will enhance the green image of the country and help greatly in selling our agricultural produce abroad.</P>

      <P>The imposition by local authorities of the strict rules which are applied to farmers in the REP scheme would go a long way to protecting the hedgerows.  Does the Minister know how many farmers have been removed from the REP scheme because of non-compliance with measure 5?  How many farmers are in the REP scheme at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 39,000 farmers in the REP scheme.  We hope there will be 43,000 this year.  The scheme caused some difficulties in counties Wicklow and Mayo where many farmers were not clear about the depopulation of herds on mountainsides where commonages were involved.  We expect the uptake of the scheme to increase because of the special areas of conservation scheme.  We hope participation in REPS will increase in these areas because they are the areas which have most need of it for the protection of land and the prevention of soil erosion. Deputy Moynihan asked if many farmers have been removed from the scheme.  Anyone who leaves the scheme or does not comply with the regulations within three years must repay the grant received.  The work of some planners has had to be examined.  One planner submitted a plan which was clearly drawn up at a kitchen table.  The planner had not looked at the land and the ditches on his map had been removed in 1982. That planner did not take his sandals off and put <Col N="1186" /> a pair of wellingtons on to go to look at the land. We will also do a review of the standards of planners. The panel of planners is continually updated.  The scheme is very strictly administered. I believe it is a great scheme and is of benefit of farmers.</P>

I ask this question out of concern for the income situation of dry stock farmers in the midlands and the west.  How does our maximum level compare with those of other EU countries?  My information is that our permitted maximum places us at the lower end of that spectrum.  Will the Minister, in the course of the review, ensure that some of the harshest and most stringent conditions which attach to the REP scheme are modified as they have been in the farm retirement scheme?</P>

      <P>The limit of 100 acres is about the same as that of other countries.  The limit can be as low as 50 acres or as high as 300 in natural heritage areas and commonages.  That is important because the aid is being targeted at farmers with the lowest incomes.  There has been a huge increase in payment this year.  It is now up <Col N="1187" /> to £175,000, not including special areas of conservation. When they are included the figure will rise to £240 million.  The amount of money being spent on the scheme is huge.  The grant is £50 per acre which brings in an income of £5,000 per year. Many farmers do the work in the first year so that the money is easily earned after that time.  The scheme is bringing wildlife back to the country-side and enhances our image as an agricultural nation.  The scheme shows small farmers the way towards quality rather than quantity.</P>

      <P>Is Ireland comparable to other countries in the uptake of the REP scheme? How does the Minister see the scheme continuing post Agenda 2000?  Will the Minister of State agree certain isolated areas need special support in preparing REPS plans and REPS planners should encourage farmers in those areas to participate in this scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keaveney that the uptake of this scheme here is reasonably comparable to the uptake of such schemes in other countries.  We would like many more farmers to participate in it.  It was estimated that 43,000 farmers would participate in the scheme this year, but only 39,000 did so.  While that represents a major improvement, it is still not good enough.</P>
      <P>We have trained planners to review commonage areas.  Since last August they have been specifically trained to encourage farmers to participate in the scheme to ensure more benefits are given to the poorer sections of the farming community. There are approximately 8,000 commonages in the country.  This will mainly affect areas of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry.  The payment will be £100 for the first 100 acres, £8 for between 101 and 200 acres and £6 for between 201 and 300 acres.  This will mean an increase from £4,960 to £6,400 in the annual payment to existing REPS farmers.  That is a significant increase in the annual payment, which should encourage farmers to participate in this scheme.  The emphasis is on quality.</P>

      <P>On the existing REP scheme which extends for five years, the Minister and I are confident it will continue into the future. <Col N="1188" /> Commissioner Fischler is interested in it.  There is growing concern not only here but throughout other European communities about the need to conserve lands, given the pollution that has taken place in Holland, the north of France, Belgium and other countries where land has been destroyed because of over-farming.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned the new plans for the SAC areas, the NHAs, that is guaranteed for 15 years.  It is worth noting that once an inspection of a farm is made and approval has been granted REPS payments are the quickest to be issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The beef carcase classification scheme is based on EU legislation, which lays down the precise classification standards for carcasses and the checks required to ensure uniformity throughout each member state.</P>
      <P>There have been no changes in these standards in recent times and I have not issued any direction that a changed approach should be taken to the grading of carcasses at slaughter plants.</P>
      <P>My Department has invested considerable resources in the beef classification scheme and makes every effort to ensure uniform standards are applied across all meat premises in conformity with the EU regulations.</P>
      <P>A comparison of the classification data for the period January to June 1998 with the period July to November 1998 shows that the variation in the percentage of cattle falling within the different grades on the EU beef classification scale is minimal. In addition, there has been no increase in the number of appeals from producers for a re-examination of the classification returns on cattle sold during this autumn period.  Both of those factors serve to illustrate the point that there has been no change in classification standards by officers of my Department.</P>
      <P>A major issue of concern in the beef industry in the past number of years has been the deterioration in carcase quality of our beef herd as measured on the classification grid.  This has resulted mainly from the flat pricing system operated by processing plants and a change in the genetic composition of the breeding herd through the increased use of the poorer conformation Holstein dairy breed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from meetings between my Department and representatives of producers and processors, a graded pricing structure, where higher prices are being paid for the better grades, has been introduced.  I am hopeful this will help to bring about a significant improvement in the <Col N="1189" /> quality of cattle produced and, eventually, lead to higher overall returns for Irish beef producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to link what the Minister of State said to what the Minister said.  I have got more complaints about lower grades than I have got for many years.  This must have come to the notice of the Minister, the Ministers of State and Deputy Penrose.  I cannot back up that with scientific data.  I am not talking about the Holstein breed but about continental breeds. Farmers who are good at their jobs have found that they were awarded a few grades below the grade they got before or that they expected.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Walsh, spoke of objectivity and subjectivity in the system.  We either have a grid or we do not.  This has nothing to do with the factories, departmental staff are responsible for grading.  Can I take it that the Minister of State specifically said that he does not believe there has been any change in policy in this area over the past few months?  How does he account for the widespread anger among farmers who believe that when things got tight at the factories and problems arose, the grades suffered?  What type of interservice business has the Minister of State with the graders?  What type of consistency operates among the graders?  Does that gel with what happens in Europe?  Something went wrong with the grading system over the past two months.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that all the officers involved in grading undergo an intensive training programme and proficiency test before they are authorised as classification officers.  They are also subject to strict supervision. I am not aware of any irregularity or change in the grading standards, but the process is carried out by human beings.  A new system has been introduced in Denmark and officers of the Department of Agriculture and Food and the industry have visited Denmark to observe that hi-tech grading system in operation, but I cannot confirm that we will introduce that system here. I will not give the Deputy the table of figures for the classification results because they are complicated and the Deputy might not be able to follow their trend, but I will make them available to him. He is correct in stating that a flat pricing system has crept in over the past four or five years.</P>

If we are to have a quality product that will sell in the market in the future, we must have a graded product of the highest quality.

Last year or the year before 46 per cent of inseminations were from those breeds.  That has also led to a deterioration.  The Deputies opposite are aware that the basis of our beef industry ten years ago was a dual purpose animal, but we have moved away from that to more refined and better blood lines in dairy and beef animals.  That is where part of the problem arises.</P>

He had 25 Charolais cattle, 11 of which were sold on 25 August for £8,836.95 and seven of them were U grades.  He kept the remainder of those cattle &mdash; the better ones &mdash; for eight weeks, fed them with barley rations and subsequently sold them for £9,313, and none of them were U grades. Does the Minister accept that is a huge difference? The best midlands cattle one could get were fed with barley ration and concentrates seven or eight weeks later.  I appreciate there is an element of subjectivity; some of the classification officers are colleagues of mine.  Will the Minister outline the appeals system available to that farmer who got only £1 extra at the factory than he got at Mullingar mart a week later for 100 kilograms more?</P>

      <P>I propose to take all the questions together.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the strength of feeling in the House on this issue.  Nonetheless, as all Deputies will be aware, the issue of an individual's tax affairs is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to pursue.  I do not have any detailed information on the case in question other than what appeared in the newspapers.  I have not asked the Revenue Commissioners for details of an individual tax case nor do I intend to do so.</P>
      <P>The House will know that it is not the practice to comment on individual cases, especially where it is likely there will be further proceedings which it would be unwise to prejudice. Deputies are already aware that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing various taxation matters arising from the report of the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> Deputies expressed outrage at the ruling by the Appeals Commissioners in this case.  I remind the House that the appeals system is there for all taxpayers to use in appealing a tax assessment.  The law regards all persons equally when it comes to individual rights and these rights must be respected.  The appeals system has been extended to most tax heads in the past few Finance Bills and the appeals procedure has been simplified. My predecessor was anxious to improve the effectiveness of the appeals procedure in the general interest of the tax system.  The Appeals Commissioners are independent in the exercise of their duty, which is a quasi-judicial one.  This fact must be underlined.</P>
    <P>As regards the publication of the Appeals Commissioners' decisions, I provided for this in the 1998 Finance Act.  The Appeals Commissioners may make arrangements for the publication of reports of such determinations by them as they consider appropriate.</P>
    <P>A decision of the Appeals Commissioners can be appealed to the Circuit Court for a full rehearing of the case, to the High Court on a point of law and ultimately to the Supreme Court. It is a matter entirely for the Revenue Commissioners to make an appeal.  I understand it is standard Revenue practice where considerable tax is at risk or where points of tax principle are involved for Revenue to vigorously pursue such liabilities and matters through the courts.  Where the issues are complex it is rare for the appeal Commissioner's decision to be taken as final by either side.  It can be taken that the Revenue Commissioners will appeal this case through the courts in keeping with their normal practice.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of Revenue powers, I have a function in this in relation to changes in the law.  As I made clear in my Budget Statement of 2 December, both Revenue and my Department have been actively reviewing the existing powers which Revenue have in combating tax evasion.  This review involves looking at extra powers in relation to access to bank accounts and the examination of the affairs of banking institutions.  Revenue powers were last increased significantly in 1992, with further additions in 1993 and 1995.  I made it clear on many occasions that all reasonable or necessary measures will be pursued to counter tax evasion. I also indicated that the Revenue Commissioners have recently made proposals to me in this regard and I will examine these in the context of the Finance Bill, 1999.</P>
    <P>I state again the Government's resolve to take such measures &mdash; whether arising out of tribunal reports or otherwise &mdash; as are needed and as are appropriate to ensure that tax liabilities can be reasonably and effectively pursued.  Tax evasion is cheating, effectively putting one's hands into another taxpayer's pocket.  As for the case in question, the law is there for the further pursuit of the tax liability and it is best for the law to take its course. <Col N="1194" /></P>

      <P>Is the Minister for Finance aware the Taoiseach confirmed to me this morning that the appeals commissioner who made this decision in respect of this case is his brother-in-law?  Will he confirm to the House the manner in which that appointment was made?  Will he tell the House that the appointment was made during the inter-regnum on 9 December 1992 when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was on his way out of office?  Will he confirm that the appointment was not announced until 22 January 1993?  Will he note that, although the appointment was made on 9 December 1992, the Government was not elected until 12 January 1993?</P>
      <P>I ask him to join me in deploring the message which this is sending to taxpayers, that the man who is the brother-in-law of the Taoiseach should be adjudicating on the tax affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not intend to cast any reflection; I merely ask the Minister to agree with me that it is sending out the wrong message to the taxpayers that the brother-in-law of the current Leader of Fianna Fáil should adjudicate on the tax affairs of the former Leader of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Will he explain to the House and to the taxpayers outside how this appeal could have been successful before the Appeals Commissioner?  Is it not the case that, in paragraph five of his statement appended to the McCracken findings, former Deputy Haughey conceded that he had received £1.3 million from the disponer in this case?  How is it conceivable that since Mr. Haughey admitted receiving the money he should have been found to have had no tax liability on it?  Is it not the case that the disponer was known to us all as being Mr. Ben Dunne?  Is it not the case that it is known that he is domiciled in this jurisdiction?  Therefore, how could an Appeals Commissioner have brought home a verdict that there is no tax liability in this instance?</P>
      <P>Furthermore, why did the Revenue Commissioners rely solely, according to reports, on the findings of the McCracken tribunal?  Why did they not assemble their own case based on the findings of the McCracken tribunal?  Is it to the Circuit Court, where matters of fact and law can be established, that the Revenue Commissioners propose to appeal or is it directly to the High Court?</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's view, having regard to how cavalier he has been in the past about tax evasion matters, of a former Taoiseach playing ducks and drakes with us now in retirement in the same fashion as he played ducks and drakes with us when he was a Member of this House?</P>

      <P>As to the status of the Taoiseach's relations with other people, I know no more than what that Taoiseach said this morning, that one of the Appeal Commissioner's is his brother-in-law.</P>
      <P>I can answer the Deputy's questions as to when these people were appointed.  There are two Appeals Commissioners.  Mr. R. F. Kelly, a chartered accountant who formerly operated as a private consultant in the area of retail banking, was appointed on 9 December 1992.  Notice of his appointment was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 January 1993.  The second Appeals Commissioner, Mr. J. F. O'Callaghan, a senior tax consultant and formerly of Farrell, Grant and Sparks, Chartered Accountants, was also appointed on 9 December 1992.  Notice of his appointment was also laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 January 1993.  I can tell the Deputy anything he wants to know about the salary of an Appeals Commissioner, grade, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct for Members of this House to use the old sly way of impugning a person's integrity, saying something and then saying that of course we are not impugning that person's integrity. That is typical of the slur which comes from the recently constituted workers' party, Democratic <Col N="1196" /> Left or whatever they are calling themselves as and from 1 February.</P>

      <P>On the questions the Deputy asked as to the basis on which the Appeals Commissioners arrived at this decision, as I pointed out on this and on previous occasions, and as is known to everybody in this House, particularly former Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Finance do not get involved in individual tax cases.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the widespread public view that Mr. Kelly, the Taoiseach's brother-in-law, acted imprudently by not allowing his colleague, Mr. O'Callaghan, to take the Haughey appeal case?  Is he aware of the precedent at the time of the Arms Trial where Judge Andreas Ó Caoimh disqualified himself from the hearing because of his close connections with Fianna Fáil and, in particular, Mr. Haughey?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Finance aware of the views expressed by Judge McCracken, that the results of his investigation was that the tribunal became satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that all of the moneys paid by Mr. Dunne were received by, or on behalf of, Mr. Charles Haughey for his benefit or in one case for a member of his family? In view of that statement in the McCracken report, can the Minister explain how Mr. Kelly came to a different conclusion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with what I suppose is a point of order.  The Minister hides behind the suggestion that Ministers for Finance do not comment on individual cases.  However, I will draw a clear analogy.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has no role in cases which appear before the courts.  However, on a number of occasions this House has rightly discussed the public implications of particular judgments.  In those circumstances, I suggest to the Minister that he is in dereliction of his duty if he does not comment on the clear public implications of a case which is causing considerable public disquiet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not adequate for the Minister to hide behind a cloak of secrecy.  Does he agree that it should be his business to comment on the public implications of this case?  Does he also agree that it is ironic that it was the Taoiseach who first said that we need a Lester Pigott and we now seem to have a Houdini in Mr. Haughey, who seems impregnable and beyond the law in every case?  Does he agree that it will be necessary to publish the report of the commissioner as soon as possible?  As a matter of general principle, can he indicate how the Revenue Commissioners approach cases of this kind and how cases are designated to a particular commissioner? Is it done by lot or rota?  Can he indicate whether expert advice was taken in this case or whether he would expect that it would be taken in cases of this kind?  Most importantly, can he indicate his view as to the status of the judgments of tribunals &mdash; the McCracken tribunal which is completed and the tribunals currently under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the foundation of the State and since the Revenue Commissioners were established, a Minister for Finance has not ever commented on an individual tax case, nor would it be appropriate to do so.  It would not be appropriate to have the Department of Finance and the Minister investigating any tax case.  The function of the Minister for Finance is to bring appropriate laws before the House in the Finance Bill.  It is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to implement the law for everyone.  That means it must be implemented for the person referred to in today's case, as it would be for any Member of this House or any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell should know the law better than some of his colleagues.  That is the way the law is and should be operated.  I will not turn the Minister and the Department of Finance into the <Col N="1198" /> downtown office of the Revenue Commissioners to pursue some cases and not others.</P>

      <P>Over a period of years the law has been strengthened in a number of taxation areas.  If the Revenue Commissioners come forward with other suggestions on how the law needs to be improved, I will give that further consideration. I am sure the House would pass those suggestions into law.  Even if I wanted to know, I would not be told about an individual tax case and I would not wish it to be any other way.  That is the way it has been and will continue to be under my stewardship.  If one of my successors wishes to bring proposals before the Houses then he or she can do so.  However, that will remain the position while I am Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this unseemly episode has the stench of golden circles and nepotism?  Can he understand the anger among compliant taxpayers who see that those who break the law and cheat on their taxes can get away with it if they are rich enough and well-connected enough?  In his capacity as an accountant, if someone came to the Minister and said they had a gift of £1.3 million, would he not point out to them that they would owe tax on that sum?  Therefore, can he not say in his capacity as an accountant that this is out of order?  Will he not make a public statement asking that the ruling be published as we need to know what is involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On my own initiative, I included in the Finance Bill, 1998, the provision that the decisions of the Appeals Commissioners could be published.  That is in train and the provisions exist to achieve that.  However, when they get around to publishing the decisions of Appeals Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners will not be publishing details of individual tax cases. The purpose of the request by tax practitioners over the years to have Appeals Commissioners' rulings published was to see the general points of principle on which our tax laws were being implemented by the Appeals Commissioners.  It is not the intention that they would specify what Mr. X owed.  That is not the intention of the publication procedures as enunciated in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy seems to give the impression that this is the end of this case.  However, as he asked me a question in my role as a former tax practitioner, I will give an answer as to what is likely to happen in this case.  In any such case of capital acquisitions tax, which seems to be what is involved in this case, 99 per cent of cases are appealed by either side.  Cases can be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court by either side. I assume that is bound to happen in this case. Anyone with a cursory knowledge of the tax code <Col N="1199" /> knows that this is the first step in a long process. This is not the end of the matter.  I offer that as free advice to the Deputy.</P>

Will the appeal that is contemplated be to the Circuit Court or to the High Court, the distinction being that in the Circuit Court matters of fact as well as law can be adjudicated upon?  Has the Minister asked the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners why the Revenue Commissioners relied solely on the McCracken report in defending this appeal from Mr. Haughey?  Let me put the following to the Minister when he derides my earlier remarks.  Let us suppose the tax affairs of Deputy Lowry were before an Appeals Commissioner, that he was assessed as having no tax liability, and that it emerged that the Appeals Commissioner was the brother-in-law of Deputy John Bruton.  What does the Minister think he <Col N="1200" /> and the motley crew behind him would be saying in this House?</P>

The actions of his predecessor as Minister for Finance are within his competence to answer.  He has control of the files and he is responsible to this House.  When was Mr. Kelly appointed?  Was it after the 1992 election result and before the Government was formed?  What were the considerations which led to the appointment as Appeals Commissioner of a man who <Col N="1201" /> was a qualified accountant with expertise in retail banking rather than in taxation matters through a political appointment process?  Does the Minister not think it would have been prudent for the Minister for Finance of the day to have taken extra precautions when appointing his brother-in-law to this politically appointed post?  Has the Minister checked the files to see what political representations were made on behalf of Mr. Kelly at the time of his appointment, what process was gone through before his appointment was ratified by the incoming Government, together with the appointment of Mr. John O'Callaghan, Mr. Greg Sparks's partner, and could the Minister throw light on the political sequence which led to the making and the confirming of these two political appointments?

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the status of the McCracken report and whether it can be used or was used in this case as the basis of the Revenue assessment.  It is perfectly reasonable and does not suggest prurient interest in Mr. Haughey's affairs to ask what is the status of that tribunal report and its findings in respect of the tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a perfectly legitimate question that should be put to the Revenue Commissioners, not to me, because our tax laws are quite clear and explicit.  They are laid down by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, and the implementation of same is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  Nothing else falls within the remit of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put something to the Minister which he will agree does fall within his remit.  If it is the case that the findings of this tribunal or the findings of any future tribunals are not admissible as accepted fact for the purpose of Revenue Commissioners' appeals, will the Minister amend the Finance Bill to ensure that they are accepted for that purpose in future?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance.  He should know more than he pretends. The question of what is proper to a tribunal under the tribunals of inquiry Act is a matter for that Act.  Subject to advice, providing that the findings of a tribunal of inquiry should be admissible in the context of the tax laws would present some difficulty, but I am open to persuasion on it.  I would remind Deputy McDowell that last night in discussing the Comptroller and Auditor General Bill, this point was raised in another context. The question of evidence found during that procedure being used in other fora was raised on that Bill.  The matter mentioned by the Deputy <Col N="1203" /> can be addressed further in the context of tribunals of inquiry and of the laws of the State regarding taxation.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas feel we should go down a particular road and hold that the findings of a tribunal of inquiry must be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing in a particular area, I am sure they will give that ample consideration in time to come.</P>

      <P>The commissioners were appointed by the Minister for Finance under section 8(50) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  The original power was contained in the Income Tax Act, 1967.  In appointing the appeals commissioners and the special commissioners of income tax, their former title, it has been the practice to appoint one from within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners with experience of income tax administration and knowledge of income tax law and two from outside the Civil Service, usually experienced barristers or chartered accountants.</P>
      <P>Deputy Higgins asked a question about the appointment of appeals commissioners.  It is within the remit of the Minister for Finance to appoint the commissioners.  Deputy Gormley also asked a question about their appointment.  Under section 8(57) of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, an appeals commissioner is required to make a statutory declaration upon taking office to the effect that he or she will carry out his or her duties under tax legislation in a proper manner and without favour, and that he or she will not disclose to any unauthorised person any matter contained in any schedule, statement, return or other document delivered to him or her under tax legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan raised a question regarding tribunals and possible changes in income tax law. As I have said repeatedly, the issue of additions to Revenue powers has been under consideration for some time and will be considered further in the run-up to the Finance Bill.  One of the terms of reference given to the Moriarty tribunal is to make recommendations in this area.</P>

The appointment was made on 9 December 1992 and notice of his appointment was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 8 January 1993.

      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the Minister means the Minister for Health and Children;&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are proposed to ensure that health boards will, immediately on the Bill coming into force, designate the officers of the health boards to whom reports of child abuse should be made and provide for the Minister to make a direction in writing to the chief executive of the health board requiring him or her to appoint specified categories of people.  I welcome the fact that this amendment is being made to the Bill.  In the context of the rearranging of this measure, I proposed on Committee Stage that the Minister so deal with matters and that in the context of health boards he designate the categories of people to whom reports of child abuse could be made.  I expressed concern that if that was not done there would be a lack of uniformity in approach among health boards.  The Minister, for reasons best known to himself, resolutely opposed amending the legislation during its passage through Dáil Éireann.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has now recognised the need for such provision in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The direction the Minister makes to the chief executive should ensure that not only those who fall within particular specified categories, such as public health nurses, social workers and medical practitioners, are granted the privilege the Bill extends to ensure a person reporting abuse is not open to civil liability when acting reasonably and in good faith.  It is important that the categories of persons to whom reports can be made and who fall within the protection of the Bill be publicly known.  I ask the Minister to confirm that the direction made to the chief executives of health boards will be published and not be a secret direction or guideline.  This will ensure the general public is aware of the categories of people who can be designated officers.  I hope that each individual health board will make known to the general public the names of the designated persons, so that somebody who urgently needs to report a concern that a child is the victim of physical or sexual abuse or is likely to become a victim, does not find himself or herself lost in a <Col N="1211" /> bureaucratic labyrinth on contacting the health board, with his or her call answered by a telephonist who does not know who the person should be referred to.  There is a need to ensure wide public knowledge to whom reports should be made and that teachers in schools and medical practitioners know to whom it is appropriate to make reports so as to ensure concerns about children are made known to a health board.</P>
    <P>It is also essential to ensure that not only people feel they may report their concerns about child abuse but that the health boards to whom reports are made respond immediately to such reports.  There is an overriding concern that our health boards lack the personnel and the capacity to respond speedily to reports of child abuse.  I would like the Minister to assure the House that the resources being provided to each health board for 1999 will ensure a person who in good faith reports to a health board that a child is the victim of abuse and believes intervention is required will know not only to whom to make such a report but that it can be made in confidence, that the health board will respond and act on those reports and that the necessary interventions required to assess the position will be available and, where necessary, a visit to the family concerned will occur.  Where required, speedy court action should take place, although that may not be necessary in a number of instances.</P>
    <P>There is concern that there is a mounting waiting list in some health board areas, in particular the Eastern Health Board area which was last reported as having in excess of 1,000 cases of reports of child abuse awaiting detailed assessment and investigation.  The Minister might clarify the current position in that regard.  In the context of these amendments, he should put on the record the categories of person he envisages will be designated by him.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to simply move these amendments.  He should place on the record the persons he envisages will fall under the categories of designated officers to whom reports of child abuse should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of agreeing to amendment No. 1 in the Seanad was to insert a definition of the term &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; as &ldquo;Minister for Health and Children&rdquo;. This was not required previously, but is necessary now because of the proposed insertion of amendment No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 was agreed in the Seanad because, as I pointed out on Second Stage in this House, I accepted in good faith and at very short notice an Opposition amendment designed to ensure the speedy implementation of this Bill when enacted.  I made it clear that is my firm intention but, unfortunately, I was subsequently advised that the amendment which I accepted might conceivably give rise to questions about the legality of the appointment of designated officers <Col N="1212" /> in the future.  Accordingly, when I was informed of this possibility, I instructed my officials to have the offending section redrafted to copperfasten the designation of officers of the health boards.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I was also cognisant of the considered contributions of a number of Deputies on Committee and Report Stages in the Dáil who advised me that I should amend the legislation to allow the Minister to give directions to chief executive officers of the regional health boards under this section.  I gave this matter careful consideration and, in the interests of ensuring a uniform approach to the granting of immunity to reporters under the terms of this Bill, I proposed the amendment of section 2 to allow a direction to be given to the chief executive officers as regards the officers to be appointed as designated officers.</P>
    <P>This amendment agreed in the Seanad will mean, in effect, that prior to the commencement of this Bill, chief executive officers will be asked to designate a broad range of categories of staff to be designated officers for the purpose of the Bill.  As I reported previously to the Dáil, I had arranged for consultations with the chief executive officers on this point.  Again for the information of the Dáil, I will outline the main categories of health board officers envisaged at this stage.  They include social workers, child care workers, public health nurses, hospital consultants, non-consultant hospital doctors, especially those employed in accident and emergency, all other medical, dental and nursing staff employed by the health board, community welfare officers, speech therapists and occupational therapists. Officials in my Department are currently finalising lists of categories of staff to be designated with the personnel officers of the health boards. We would be happy to consider any proposals Deputies may have.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied these are the professionals in whom the public is most likely to confide or express concerns.  In practice, these staff will then pass on the reports immediately to the relevant child care staff in the health board who in most cases will be the child care manager.  As I said on numerous occasions, I am anxious to have as wide a range of personnel as possible within the health boards designated under this section.</P>
    <P>We have gone as far as possible in meeting legitimate concerns about the immediate and uniform implementation of the legislation through this revised section 2.  I am happy to commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>I confirm for Deputy Shatter that those who are designated will be made available publicly so that people clearly understand to whom they may report.  Amendment No. 6 is a technical amendment and was necessitated to ensure consistency of nomenclature throughout the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with this amendment, I particularly welcome the broad acceptance by Senators of the new offence of false reporting of child abuse which I introduced.  I do not wish to resume the debate on this issue at this stage, but I am happy it is there as it gives an essential balance to this legislation.  In agreeing to amendment No. 7, the Seanad accepted my proposal to increase the length of time available for the institution of summary proceedings regarding the person who alleges he or she has been the victim of a false or malicious report of child abuse.  Prior to its acceptance, the Bill stated that such proceedings should be instituted within 12 months from the date of the offence.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate in the Seanad I listened carefully to Senators comments regarding this issue and I understand the intention behind a Labour Party proposal which, unfortunately, I had to reject in favour of my own amendment.  What both Senators and I sought was an extension of the time limit for bringing a complaint under the section.  I was pleased to bring forward my own proposal which I believe meets the concerns of Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5(3), as agreed in the Seanad to amend, allows for a period of two years from the date on which the offence is committed or, if later, two years from the date on which evidence that in the opinion of the complainant is sufficient to justify the bringing of proceedings comes to that person's knowledge.  In layman's terms, section 5(4) will allow for a certificate to be produced by the <Col N="1215" /> complainant to the effect that evidence came to his or her knowledge at a particular time and that this evidence be accepted by the courts.  I consider this amendment meets all the concerns of Senators which are legitimate and well made.  I am happy to commend it to the House, if Deputies agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to re-fight old battles, but I want to put on the record that this section which the Minister has insisted be included in the Bill and which was supported by the Labour Party will prove to be most unhelpful in practice and will be used as a weapon by some persons accused of child abuse to intimidate people who have made complaints.  If there is an application to take a child into care which could, for a variety of reasons, be unsuccessful, the person who made the complaint will render himself or herself liable to criminal prosecution.  I am also concerned that, in the unfortunate and unpleasant emotive warfare which occurs between estranged spouses in marriage breakdown, this section may be used by people with obsessive personalities as a tool of war in circumstances where, in a matrimonial custody dispute, one spouse alleges the other has sexually or physically abused a child.</P>
      <P>It is misplaced to insert the section in the Bill at this time.  When it was debated in the House, I urged that, in the context of what we are achieving with the Bill in other ways, if the Minister was insistent on inclusion of the section, it should be subject to a provision that it would not be brought into operation for a period of two years from the time the Bill commenced so that we would have experience of the legislation working and be in a position to ascertain if the section was required.  If it was judged to be so, it could then be brought into operation by ministerial order.  I hope my worries about it are proved to be wrong. I have no interest in scoring political points in the context of the measure.  Earlier amendments strengthen the Bill and are of great value but this criminal provision is misplaced.  I am concerned that, in seeking to provide a balance, we are providing a weapon which may be used by people who have abused children to try to deflect persons with genuine concerns from making complaints. I am worried about that and hope my worries and concerns are wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is important the legislation is put on the Statute Book.  I recognise in the context of numbers in the House and the Government and the Labour Party supporting the provision that there is little point in calling a vote on the matter and I am anxious we proceed with enacting the rest of the Bill.  I suggest we may have to revisit the section if it is discovered there are difficulties in the area.  In the context of monitoring how well the legislation functions, perhaps it might be ensured that health boards, in their annual reports, state how useful the legislation <Col N="1216" /> has been and if section 5 has impeded their work in the child care area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concerns but his worries are unfounded.  I am confident the provisions in the amendment are adequate. Should there be a problem, we would be happy to revisit this element of the legislation.  There will be close monitoring of the implementation of the legislation through the health boards and we will be in constant contact with them in that regard.  Should difficulties arise, I would be happy to revisit these issues.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Section 6.  In page 6, lines 37 to 40 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.  &mdash;Section 3 of this Act is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any privilege or defence available in legal proceedings, by virtue of any enactment or rule of law in force immediately before the passing of this Act, in respect of the communication by a person to another (whether that other person is an appropriate person or not) of his or her opinion that</P>
      <P>(a) a child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, or</P>
      <P>(b) a child's health, development or welfare has been or is being avoidably impaired or neglected.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In agreeing this amendment in the Seanad, the intention was to clarify that the statutory immunity offered under the provisions of the Bill was designed to complement any common law privileges which already existed.  A worthwhile debate occurred on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined my determination to ensure the central thrust of the Bill &mdash; to encourage reporting to statutory authorities &mdash; is not diminished.  This is good reporting practice and allows for trained personnel to investigate reports and to make objective decisions regarding allegations. I have ensured the widest possible grouping of health professionals is available for the purposes of receiving reports of child abuse.  It is also in response to Deputy Shatter's earlier points about the waiting period, the efficiency of investigations, the speed with which they are conducted, the level of treatment provided where necessary and the referral of such cases to court that we have gone to some considerable effort to ensure proper reporting protocols.  The group established to review the guidelines will report in February. Additional funding has been made available to reduce waiting times and ensure a quick and effective response, especially in the Eastern Health Board area.  People who report child abuse to those individuals will enjoy the benefits of immunity offered by the Bill.  The immunity is <Col N="1217" /> also enjoyed by those who report reasonably and in good faith to any member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the Seanad, we discussed the possibility of parallel reporting to both statutory authorities and to the chairman of a club or organisation.  I have been advised that to introduce requirements in this manner would amount to mandatory reporting.  It would pre-empt the work in progress on legislation in this area and would go outside the remit of the Bill, which is primarily concerned with protections for those reporting as distinct from the reporting process <i>per se.</i>  People who report concerns about child abuse reasonably and in good faith within a club can avail of the defence of qualified privilege under common law.  Since we last debated the Bill, I arranged to meet Dr. Roderick Murphy, who chaired the independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming.  He assured me he was happy with the approach taken in the Bill to the granting of a statutory immunity for people reporting child abuse.  He agreed that reports to statutory authorities should be encouraged.  However, it is appreciated that reporting to health boards or the Garda cannot be seen in a vacuum.  Most organisations providing services for children now have their own written procedures for dealing with allegations of child abuse, and my Department and other Departments are actively encouraging those who have guidelines to review them and those who do not to introduce them as quickly as possible.  A person who reports an allegation to statutory authorities will, in most cases, also feel a duty to pass on the information to a person in authority in the organisation.</P>
    <P>I emphasised in the House and in the Seanad that, in this situation, a person who reports reasonably and in good faith is covered by the defence of qualified privilege under common law. Section 6 as agreed on Report Stage in the Dáil on 1 July provided a saving provision in this regard.  I listened with interest to what Senators said on Committee Stage in the Seanad and accepted that the wording of section 6 might not be easy to understand.  As a non-legal person, I am especially conscious of the need for as much clarity as possible in legislation.  Accordingly, to make the issue clearer, I provided for an expansion of section 6 in the amendment which the Seanad agreed to on 26 November.  I was also conscious of the last debate on this issue in the Dáil, especially with Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>I am confident the amendment will reassure people concerning internal reporting procedures. Along with the administrative measures I have already outlined to deal with delays in treatment of employees accused of abuse, this is an effective and pragmatic approach.  I accept there are many related issues which need to be carefully teased out when it comes to the drafting of mandatory reporting legislation.  At this stage, I am pleased to commend the amendment to the House. <Col N="1218" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the movement from the Minister in providing a broader provision in this regard.  It must be seen in the context of the changes made to earlier sections which, instead of providing for one or two designated officers in a health board being entitled to take reports of child abuse under the legislation, it now provides for a whole category of different people.  I welcome the link between the two in this amendment. In the context of clubs, such as sports clubs, the Minister said that if someone believes the child to be a victim of abuse and reports his or her concerns to an appropriate member of the club, the person making that report has a form of privilege extended to the report made.  Privilege is based on reporting in good faith and not acting maliciously.</P>
      <P>When dealing with the modified version of the Bill as dealt with through the Department of Health and Children I considered it more appropriate to make explicit provision in relation to sports clubs, particularly in light of the contents of Dr. Murphy's report.  I am still of that view.  I fully accept that what the Minister is doing will substantially improve the position.  I also remain of the view that there is no reason we could not have provided for the explicit, as opposed to the implicit, protection in the context of sports clubs that I proposed be included in the Bill on Report Stage.  Nevertheless I welcome the fact that there has been movement from the Minister's side.  If there is widespread knowledge in the community of the categories of people who come under the umbrella of being an appropriate person or a designated officer of a health board, some of my concerns will be addressed.  Those concerns will only be addressed if there is a guarantee from the Minister that in the event of a parent, member of a sports club or a victim reporting that abuse has occurred to a designated officer of a health board there will be an immediate response from the health board.  If the health board lacks the capacity to respond speedily, reports of abuse will be ignored for months and the perpetrator of the abuse may continue to abuse children even after reports have been made.</P>
      <P>What is the current position regarding health boards, particularly the Eastern Health Board? We are entitled to know.  What is the backlog in the context of the health board responding to reports of abuse?  In respect of the Eastern Health Board, how many reports of child abuse is the health board in receipt of that have not yet resulted in an investigation commencing and family assessments being undertaken?  If the Minister has that information in relation to other health boards perhaps he would put it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 15 Private Members' Bills I have published, this is the fourth which will be enacted into law.  While the Minister and I have had some strong words on this measure I welcome the fact that it will be enacted.  I welcome the fact that we will be able to debate its provisions on the floor of the House.  I had great reservations as to what <Col N="1219" /> would be its ultimate content as we went through Committee Stage, in the context of the Department's approach.  We now have a better Bill following the Seanad amendments.  This Bill is only one of a number of steps that must be taken to tackle the problem of child abuse and children at risk.  It is one further step in the right direction.  I thank the Minister for not adopting the kneejerk response which many Private Members' Bills get, agreeing to accept the principle of the Bill and allowing it to proceed to the position where it will be enacted this afternoon and become operative early in the new year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I cannot provide the specific information requested by the Deputy on waiting list times in the Eastern Health Board or other health boards but I will be happy to make that information available to the Deputy.  I understand the situation is improving, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area.  The appointment of child care managers which were long overdue will add significantly to the ability of the Eastern Health Board to deal more effectively with reports of child abuse.  Given the recent significant allocation to the Eastern Health Board there should be a much better response.</P>
      <P>The emphasis is on intervention and attempting to prevent abuse in families at risk.  It will have an immediate impact in dealing with family situations which would ultimately become much worse and give rise to more serious problems. While we have taken the first step, the challenge is to expand that intervention approach right across the country.  We are starting in some of the disadvantaged areas where there is a high risk of abuse, mainly physical and emotional abuse which unfortunately is not being tackled effectively.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shatter, Deputy Shortall and other Deputies for their contributions to the Bill. One will not get a kneejerk reaction to good legislative proposals on this side.  While we did have some strong words I agree with Deputy Shatter that we have compromised on what is good legislation.  I thank him for his initiative in introducing the legislation which the Government was happy to go along with.  The Government amendments have improved the Bill considerably and some of the amendments we have accepted have provided further improvements.  The Bill is balanced.  It enhances our efforts to ensure quality in the reporting mechanism.  That can only be done by introducing a culture of reporting to the statutory authorities who have the ability to respond quickly and effectively.  I am happy that principle remains central to the Bill.  I have no doubt the original intention of the Bill will be greatly enhanced as the Bill is enacted and comes into operation in the New Year.  I thank Deputy Shatter and Deputy Shortall for their contributions. I thank also my officials who have worked tirelessly in getting this Bill right.  I am happy with this legislation.</P>

      <P>Section 2.  In page 3, subsection (1), all words from and including &ldquo;at an&rdquo; in line 27 down to and including line 29 deleted and the following substituted:</P>

      <P>Paragraph (a) of amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment which I am introducing on the advice of the Attorney General's office.  The amendments accepted on Committee Stage in this House provided for the addition of the institutes of technology and the Irish School of Ecumenics to the list of third level institutions at which beneficiaries of the fund could study.  The Attorney General's office has recommended that paragraph (a) of amendment No. 1 is necessary to define more precisely what institutions come within the terms of the Irish School of Ecumenics and institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of amendment No. 1 will amend the list of institutions further to permit the inclusion of third level institutions in Northern Ireland.  It provides that beneficiaries of the fund may study at such universities and other institutes of higher learning in Northern Ireland as the Minister may specify, provided that the said institutions and any other relevant competent authorities consent.  This amendment which was proposed in the other House and accepted by me during the course of debate there is in keeping with the spirit and motivation underpinning the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of the amendment.  In our original deliberations on the Bill we focused almost exclusively on the background to its introduction and the work of Senator George Mitchell.  It was seriously remiss of the House not to have noted the anomaly Senator Quinn has brought to our attention.  The Bill will undoubtedly be improved by the addition of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he received legal advice which stated that he was obliged to specifically list the colleges to which the Bill will reply in the Republic.  Why is he not obliged to provide such a listing for Northern Ireland?  In my opinion what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander but it seems that a general formulation applies in respect of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The original advice was that we could not legislate for colleges in another jurisdiction. Following the Committee Stage debate in the Seanad we took further advice to see if the proposals put forward by Senator Quinn and others could be accommodated.  One must be sensitive in this area.  One cannot assume that one has jurisdiction over colleges in another state.  We made contact with the Northern Ireland authorities, to which the term &ldquo;competent authority&rdquo; refers, in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is general satisfaction that the amendment covers the concept of students being able to study at institutions of higher learning in Northern Ireland.  I presume that the colleges themselves apply for inclusion or the competent authority, pending developments, will be able to set down criteria.  The key point is that the Bill will allow students to study at colleges in Northern Ireland and that there is consent for this on all sides.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 1, existing legislation contains definitions of higher education institutions in this country.  Therefore, they and the universities are covered under previous Acts.  It is easier and more precise to refer to the previous Acts in the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, paragraph (b), to delete lines 17 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) the carrying out of scientific and technological research and/or development and any research in other fields directly supportive of scientific or technological developments,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill involves two amendments to the original Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, namely, the introduction of an additional £30 million into the fund and a broadening of the focus of research and development to include research in any area of education including science and technology.  Therefore, the Bill involves a significant broadening of the scope of the original Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill has the potential to permit the funding not only of scientific and technological research but also research into other areas of education such as law, teaching methods, economics, physics, etc.  We risk broadening the base of work supported by the fund to such an extent that any department of a university with research under way can look to the fund as a possible source of finance.  As a result the focus will move from being strictly targeted on science and technology to being targeted on the humanities, the law or economics.  Having worked in research in the area of socio-economics, I am aware that the appetite for research in that area knows no bounds.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that many worthy projects in the area of economic and social research will seek finance from the fund, which was not the original intention.  When the Oireachtas agreed to establish the fund it did so in the belief that we need to take a strategic view of the sorts of technologies which will be crucial to future economic success.  It was not envisaged that the fund would have the broader economic, social and educational focus it is now being given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 takes on board something <Col N="1223" /> of the broadening of the scope of the fund by stating that the focus of research will lean towards the scientific and technological but will also include any research in other fields which will be supportive of scientific or technological developments. For example, if electronic mail, information technology and electronic commerce become key areas of scientific and technological development for Ireland in respect of which we want to develop strength and competence, legal issues surrounding the use of electronic transfer will become crucial to whether we position ourselves to become successful in the use of this new type of technology.  If such issues emerge from a strategic area of science and technology that we have identified as being of benefit to Ireland, it is appropriate that the fund should finance research into overcoming such legal or technical difficulties, despite the fact that they may not be scientific or technological in nature.</P>
    <P>I will be satisfied if the approach I have outlined is followed.  However, I am far from convinced, having heard what the Minister said both on Second Stage and when he launched the fund. Everyone will state that they agree with economic and social research, research into the humanities, etc.  However, should such research be paid for out of this fund, thereby reducing the amount of money available for improving Ireland's position in respect of science and technology?  The case for this is not properly proven by the Minister and I would prefer to maintain a tighter focus on the money being voted for this Bill which emerged as a result a specific need.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Bill properly encompasses the concept of appointing a proper board to take a long-term strategic view of Ireland's needs in this area.  However, I am glad to hear that the Minister intends to appoint a group to advise on the selection of research projects. The Minister will recall, from the Committee Stage debate on the original legislation, that I believe a board comprising strong industrial and other representation should help to identify the strategic areas where money should be invested. We have come halfway in that regard but we have again failed to give the board statutory recognition. The Minister has not proved that there is a need to dramatically change the focus of research to be financed from the fund.  I offer this amendment to travel some of the road with him in the context of Ireland's strategic science and technology needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a dilemma.  While I have no problem in focusing on science and technology, I understand there are difficulties when it comes to literacy and, to a lesser extent, numeracy. To ensure quality in science and technology projects it is important that all those participating have the requisite basic skills.  Literacy and numeracy present difficulties when it comes to the green certificate in agriculture presented by <Col N="1224" /> Teagasc.  There is a danger that we will end up with expert morons.</P>
      <P>The humanities play an important part in education and research and development.  Research is about asking the right questions.  It is a question of emphasis but I would have a difficulty if social and economic research was not part of the package. To divorce it from science and technology is not the best way to proceed.  A proper overview will allow the correct balance to be struck.  I am, therefore, inclined to favour the Minister's formulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill strikes a balance in terms of its objectives.  The purpose of the Principal Act was to develop the capabilities of third level institutions and primary and second level schools in the areas of science and technology. A small portion of the £250 million allocated in November was set aside for research and development.  Recent developments have changed the situation.</P>
      <P>The research initiative launched recently, the basis for the amendment to the Principal Act, involves significant expenditure.  A sum of £75 million of State funding is to be generated through a mixture of dedicated funding from the investment fund and tax reliefs.  A similar sum is to be raised by third level institutions from private sources.  Current expenditure will account for a further £30 million, giving an overall investment of £180 million.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong in the circumstances to confine investment to research in science and technology. There is a need for balance.  For this reason I do not want to exclude research in other areas of education.  Research in the humanities and social sciences is important and the opportunity should not be lost to support it.</P>
      <P>This approach is reasonable.  It will allow us meet some of the points raised by Deputy O'Shea on literacy and numeracy levels.  Many institutions have strengths in strategic areas.  The method of assessment is objective and transparent and has an international dimension.  In time it will challenge the institutions to adopt a strategic approach in the projects they submit to the assessment panel for funding.  It is a competitive process which will bring the best out of our institutions.  It is not a question of collecting £180 million and doling it out.</P>
      <P>Research in the humanities is of importance to industry.  The argument that there is a clear demarcation line between research in science and technology and in the humanities is not valid. One can cite good examples where they have been combined.  Those involved in industry speak highly of graduates in the humanities as being key players in the areas of personnel and human resource management.  In the technological revolution the demarcation lines have been blurred. I would like to see universities linking up with institutes of technology to present joint research submissions which match their strengths.  This is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> Up to £120 million of the £250 million mentioned will be allocated to institutes of technology. About £60 million is to be invested in software engineer and technician programmes.  A total of £20 million has been dedicated to PLCs and apprenticeship training.  Equipment grants will also be available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not impressed by the arguments advanced by the Minister.  What he is saying is that because the fund is becoming so big we have to think again about what we should do with the money, that it should be extended to areas other than science and technology. That is not what is happening. This is not a lottery fund which is growing like Topsy.  The money in this fund is being taken from the taxpayer and the fund, with good reason, is labelled &ldquo;science and technology fund&rdquo;.  It was perceived that Ireland needed to develop the technologies which would bring us success in the next generation.  No one will appreciate that need better than the Acting Chairman whose neighbouring constituency suffered because it was not equipped with the necessary technology at the right time.  The importance of the need to develop technology which is the background to the establishment of the fund is undoubted.</P>
      <P>The Minister says he is putting another £30 million into the fund but he is changing the focus of the fund dramatically.  This fund is not the only research vehicle available to the Minister.  If he feels there is a need for research in the humanities or social sciences he has other lines in his departmental budget where he can fund that. There are many lines scattered throughout his departmental budget supporting research in different fields of endeavour.  I support continued work in those spheres.  I am not at all convinced by the reasoning behind the decision that the fund which was to have a specific scientific and technological focus is no longer to have that focus.  It would be interesting to know who sought this change.  Where did the idea come from that we had fulfilled the need to invest in research in the narrow focused area that was originally envisaged, and that we needed to move into new fields?  I did not hear any hard evidence in either of the Minister's speeches to suggest that our third level institutions have got on top of the challenge of scientific and technological research.  Far from it.  Our third level institutions are well behind the pace in many scientific and technological areas.  Members on both sides of the House recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In setting up a science and technology fund we are not prescribing for the whole educational system. We are not saying that we should abandon the idea of a rounded educational system in favour of one dominated by science and technology. I was enthusiastic about the establishment of the fund because it showed that we were recognising our real weakness in this field.  This weakness is evidenced, as the Deputy and the Minister know, by a declining take-up of science options in our <Col N="1226" /> secondary schools and by underfunding of science in our third level colleges compared with institutions in competitor countries of a similar size. We had weaknesses in our capacities in science and technology which needed to be bridged. Equally, we had developed highly technological industries without the corresponding seed bed of technological research within our third level institutions. This is an important issue.  Huge and prestigious companies such as Intel and Hewlett-Packard are operating in Ireland but they do very little research here except for that connected with process adaptation.  These companies are a resource into which we must tap.  We must use this fund to establish partnerships between our third level institutions and these companies so that their next generation of products is embedded in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This change in the fund seems to have happened by accident.  I suspect that someone, not the Minister, had the idea that it would be nice to have a favorite project on, perhaps, legal affairs funded by the science and technology fund.  That was not the thinking behind the establishment of the fund and if such thinking is beginning to grow it should be nipped in the bud.  It would be unfortunate if the non-technological area was allowed to grow out of proportion because it was felt that science faculties were receiving an unfairly generous amount of money from this fund.  That would be a serious mistake.  I appeal to the Minister not to abandon his original intention.  We must ensure that the economic success we are enjoying from the location of high tech industries in Ireland will continue.  We must create the capability to produce the next generation of products. Product change in this area is so fast that we do not have time to let this opportunity slip from us.  I detect the sort of thinking which could be invidious to the long-term interest of a fund which calls itself a science and technology fund.</P>
    <P>Despite my pleas to the Minister we did not, at the outset, put in place a board with a strong research and development background and with representation from the key progressive industries at the leading edge of technology to manage the fund.  Such a board could have driven its thinking in a strategic way and identified the technologies for which Ireland must position itself. Instead, I see third level institutions with their broad subject base creeping back to recover ground which they lost the first time round.  I fear the original focus of the fund will be lost.  I do not wish to diminish what Deputy O'Shea said about the need for a broadly based educational system or what the Minister said about industry's need for skills in broader areas.  The ability to work in groups and manage people is needed in modern industry.  However, we still need research and investment in science and technology.  I worry about the shift in the focus of the fund which has developed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I differ very little from Deputy Bruton.  Research in the humanities and social sciences <Col N="1227" /> which could be permitted under this fund could be supportive of and interactive with the sciences and technology.  We are all agreed that not enough research is being done in Ireland. Valuable research could be done to discover why that is the case and to identify the means to develop scientific research.  For instance, an important feature of the Regional Colleges Bill and the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill was a provision for campus companies.  As far as I know, we have not had great success in that area. We have been speaking of institutions rather than companies carrying out research.  I understood the Minister to say that the community at large will benefit from the research financed by this fund.  I do not know if product research by companies could be funded within a campus company structure.  Reports indicate worrying literacy difficulties among third level students.  I envisage the ethos of research and development being itself the subject of research.  This would of necessity enter areas other than basic science.  We are not doing enough research.  We must provide the funds and identify the projects, but we must carefully monitor what we are doing to ensure taxpayers get value for money and that the basic objectives, the development of value added products and services, will add not only to the training students will obtain but to the way we develop the frontier of scientific knowledge in our scientific community.  Those are the types of benefits we need.  Careful monitoring in this area would isolate and identify those factors, whether social or economic, which are preventing more of this type of work being undertaken and inhibiting the most effective type of research and development in our institutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the £250 million agreed last year under the investment fund, approximately £230 million has been approved or sanctioned and allocated for areas exclusively in the scientific and technological fields.  The remaining fund is for research purposes and we are adding £30 million to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful we do not accept the basic principle that research into humanities and the social sciences fits in with the overall strategic objective of this country developing a strong research capacity.  That is fundamental.  The problem up to now has not been with the institutions but with the State's response and commitment to research.  Traditionally the State's commitment to and input into research has been low by any international standards.  The evidence is that our institutions have performed extremely well without State support in securing international investment, particularly European Union investment, under the various framework measures over the past decade.  The universities have been extremely successful in winning research contracts against competitors across Europe within the European Union context.  That illustrates that far from their being behind the posse in terms of <Col N="1228" /> being competitive and pioneering in research areas of science and technology, they have been to the fore.  The return to Ireland from the fourth framework programme was in the region of £140 million.  In that regard, we can thank the various institutions which collaborated with industry in a number of areas and developed good research programmes.  This additional money will enable Ireland to seek funding under the fifth EU research framework programme, which will be discussed in the coming weeks in the context of budgetary discussions in Europe.  Our demonstration of good faith in this regard will enhance the capacity of our institutions to be successful again in competing for those funds.</P>
    <P>The amended Bill does not desert the emphasis on science and technology.  The language in it is clear.  It refers to the carrying out of research and development in any area of education including, in particular, scientific and technological research and scientific and technological development.  A good deal of private money will be generated as a result of this. Deputy Bruton asked why we should include the humanities.  The institutions have told us that worthwhile humanitarian programmes generate good financial contributions from the private sector and they should be allowed bid for this money or be part of the process.  That makes sense.  It could also add to the overall research capacity of an institution.  We would unnecessarily confine the area too much if we were to focus exclusively on science and technology. Last year was the first time the Department of Education and Science had a subhead on the current side on humanities research.  It is interesting that two of the institutes of technology did quite well, but many believed they would not do so well.  They were assessed by a national board of assessors, not by officials in the Department.  Some of the institutes of technology indicated that they believe they can also raise private funding in the context of this initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Shea's point.  He and I are coming closer together on this point.  My amendment seeks to ensure this money would fund the carrying out of scientific and technological research and-or development, which is the original provision, and any research in other fields directly supportive of scientific or technological developments.  As the Deputy suggested, we need to examine why science has not been chosen in certain areas.  If we were to research that, I would consider that to be directly supportive of science and technological development and I would support its funding from this source. However, that is different from what the Minister said.  He said there are many areas in the humanities which are important to research and asked why we should not use the science and technological fund to research them.</P>

      <P>We did not have anywhere near £180 million of research projects under the first fund.  A total of £15 million was allocated to research, which at the time we thought was a significant direct investment in research.  We now have a substantial sum of money, £180 million.  It would fly in the face of good sense and intelligence to say that any research project from the humanities that could have a compelling case and would be as relevant to the productive capacity of this country as a science or an exclusively technological research project should be excluded from this research initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to funding the humanities or economic and social research. I spent a good few years of my life doing that.  It can be very valuable and improve economic performance, if it is done properly.  That is not to call it science and technology.  The ESRI is funded directly from the Department of Finance to conduct such research.  Funds are available for humanities research, but that does not mean we should raid the science and technology fund to get money for worthy causes.  There are many worthy causes.  We should research homelessness on our streets.  Why do we have such a problem? What led to it?  Much of it is related to the education sphere.  No one would suggest that a science and technology fund should be used to investigate that type of problem.  One would correctly say there is an obligation on the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Education and Science to undertake work in that area and to fund the necessary research to ensure they have effective policies.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has decided to raid the science and technology fund to do something different.  The Minister said we still mention science and technology.  We do, but we mention it as an afterthought in a new amendment, while the original provision stated that it was for the carrying out of scientific and technological research and-or development on or behalf of a body, college or institute.  It was clear and focused.  The Minister is introducing other extraneous areas.  I asked the Minister to say who sought these changes, but that was not evident from his contributions. Who was consulted about them?  I did not hear who was consulted or who sought these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the science and technology community would agree with the Minister that these changes are necessary or desirable and that we want to see the focus broadened.  My impression of what the science and technology community is saying to us is that <Col N="1230" /> it does not have anywhere near enough money and that this £30 million will not bridge that gap. My understanding, and I am sure the Minister's officials will correct me if I am wrong, is that when the last study of how Ireland stacked up in S&amp;T research within the colleges of higher education was done, we were spending a quarter of what was spent in Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Germany.  We have not come to such a point in worthwhile projects in science and technology that we can now decide to redirect our funds.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify how wide the consultation has been on this issue.  I understand that advisory committees on science and technology are available to the Minister.  What input did they have in this decision to refocus the research budgets from this fund?  Why did they argue for dropping the potential to continue with high levels of science and technology in favour of other areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dropping anything but adding considerably to the fund.  The Bill allows us to add not only the £30 million but the £75 million the institutions have told us they will be in a position to generate as matching funding.  We are not raiding any fund.  There was only £15 million in the original fund for research, but this is a much bigger one.  We consulted the chairman of the Higher Education Authority about this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The entire research community would only have dreamt of this two months ago. The Deputy is correct about the poor levels of research funding allocated by the State.  No one dreamt we would introduce a £180 million package or that we would have a £250 million package with £15 million towards research.  The entire research community was cynical about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a valid point.  We met all the representative groups on the day of the launch and they were enthusiastic about it because their fundamental view is that Ireland should have a strong research infrastructure and capacity.  This initiative attempts to achieve that.  I acknowledge we have more to do and I would like more funding to be given to it, but the development of a coherent research capacity represents a substantial improvement on what we have done over the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the view that there should be segregation in terms of research and that we should <Col N="1231" /> have a pigeon hole for science and technology and another for humanities.  It is my contention that as research develops, there will be more cross-faculty research projects between the sciences and humanities.  We must be flexible and strategic because that is the way forward.</P>
    <P>Innovative research will emanate from this initiative which will add to Ireland's science and technology capacity and innovation.  Research helps to develop critical inquiry faculties and to enhance the quality of teaching in higher education institutes, which is extremely important in terms of the country's ultimate productive capacity and economic performance.</P>
    <P>I do not look at this initiative from Deputy Richard Bruton's perspective that we are raiding another fund.  We are not raiding anything but putting in place a solid and substantial research budget which encompasses the full spectrum of research activity.  We are submitting that to an objective and transparent assessment procedure which will involve both non-academics and international academics, four of whom will be from the science and technology field.  There is no danger of losing the science and technology emphasis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The more the Minister speaks, the more we seem to be asking why we should have a science and technology fund.  The Minister is saying that science and technology should not be singled out for special attention because it is all part of a continuum.  It was because it was a neglected area and was not part of a continuum that we decided to set up a special fund. However, the fund is gradually ceasing to have any meaning.  We are simply recycling State money if we do not establish a strong board or allow money to accumulate in the fund, which is the normal concept.</P>
      <P>The Minister is broadening the scope of the research to be funded.  Everyone was delighted when the Minister announced the provision of more funds.  However, it is clear the idea of broadening the focus from science and technology to the humanities was not properly mediated through different people working in the area of science and technology.</P>
      <P>It seems the Higher Education Authority has been given a broader remit.  My understanding is that the councils the Minister will set up will be dominated by academics and that they will not have proper industrial representation.  I would have liked an industrialist to head these councils rather than someone from the Higher Education Authority.  We are losing our focus.  The Minister seems to have made up his mind and does not seem to be willing to accept the changes I am proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Times are changing.  Some of Deputy Richard Bruton's comments indicate a mindset and perspective which are out of date in terms of our higher education institutes.  Universities <Col N="1232" /> and institutes of technology are engaging with industry.  They work in joint collaboration on a range of research projects.  We are not talking about a fuddy duddy professor in an ivory tower; that day has gone.  Our universities are different from those we had 20, 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>Irish research has a commendable history in terms of good innovators and research scientists whom we do not often celebrate.  As regards participation in science outputs, we are at the top of the OECD league despite underfunding.  We have a good base on which to build.  The view that educational institutions should be kept away from this area and that it should be the preserve of someone in industry is not valid.</P>
      <P>The entire science and technology committee has welcomed this initiative.  It was at the launch along with people from IDA Ireland, Forfás, the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, and officials from both Departments who also welcomed it.</P>
      <P>The institutions have a key role to play.  There will be three non-academic members on the assessment board.  There was a member from industry and from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, for example, on the assessment board this year.  There will be four international people from the science and technology field, albeit practising academics, on the assessment board.  People from the academic community who are involved in science and technology collaborate and have a strong relationship with industry.</P>
      <P>We should remind ourselves that we are adding significantly to a research fund which did not exist before.  We are not subtracting from anything but adding a significant amount of money and generating considerable private money.  We are trying to get a good deal for the State.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 lengthens the period within which all parts of the Act must be commenced from one year to two years after enactment.  We had discussed this in Committee in the Dáil and we decided on one year.  We discussed it again in the Seanad and we compromised on two years as between one and three years.  The Bill proposes a one year limit on the commencement of all sections.  I assure the Deputies that it is my intention to implement all sections of the Act as soon as possible.  However, I must be mindful of the practicalities.  It may not be possible for me to implement all sections within a one year period.  Therefore, to be prudent and to allow for the drafting and laying of regulations where necessary, I propose to lengthen the commencement period from one year to two years.</P>
      <P>I had consultations with my officials on this.  I want to be practical and honest about it.  If we provide that it will occur in one year, there is a doubt as to whether or not it can be done because a raft of actions will flow from this substantial Bill.  It will need a dedicated team and an implementation strategy on which I intend to move forward rapidly once the Bill is passed.</P>

    <P>The aim of amendment No. 2 is to provide that the Minister must report formally to the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual basis in regard to progress on the implementation of the Act.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

This is an important amendment, not least because there is widespread support for the belief that teaching methods in Ireland are unduly narrow and do not recognise what are regarded as multiple intelligences.  There is need to broaden the scope of teaching methods.  Providing for this explicitly in the Bill is good.  I hope it will spur on the Department and others in the education field to take an interest in working in this area.</P>
      <P>I also welcome amendment No. 9.

      <P>We are dealing with subsection (3)(a)(i), under which an inspector has carried out an evaluation or assessment.  He or she may make recommendations to the Minister in respect of improvements that he or she considers appropriate in respect of the overall school.  It is important to make this point explicit. <Col N="1238" /></P>

      <P>Perhaps I confused this issue. On Report Stage we discussed whether the Minister would reflect on the possibility of what was termed an individual education plan for children with particular needs.  I understood that the Minister was considering something in this area in the Seanad or subsequent to that stage.  I mistakenly read this as a response to that undertaking.  Has the Minister any proposals on the concept of individual education plans for individual students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy tabled amendment No. 60 on section 13 which related to this and he sought to introduce an entitlement to statements for each child with special educational needs.  The Attorney General's office has advised against this provision.  The legal advice is that an aspirational statement such as this cannot appear in primary legislation.  Any statement must include details of the system of assessment, the object of the assessment, its status and so on.  It would require a new section and it cannot be included in section 13.</P>
      <P>However, in terms of what we are doing for those with special needs, we are moving in the direction of assessments for individual children with special needs.  That is where we are heading in terms of resources and of automatic entitlements to staffing resources and child care assistants.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not relate to the Deputy's amendment.  This is a separate amendment and does not relate to the point the Deputy made under section 60.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Attorney General's ruling.  My recollection of the debate was that we tried to frame a section so that it would not have absolute, legally binding provisions on the Minister.  The Attorney General seems to have expressed the view that once one moves away from an absolute, legally binding provision, it is aspirational.  Of course it is aspirational, as is much of what we are doing with the Bill.  We are setting objectives for the education system which we recognise are aspirations but which we hope the system will achieve.  One cannot change the world overnight by legislation. However, one can set signposts.  It is a pity the Attorney General did not see this in the context of a signpost which would have been welcome. The Minister is endeavouring in other provisions to begin down this road.</P>

There is a provision which allows the development of that valuable concept.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments concern the functions of the body which I propose to establish to promote and advise me on Irish language teaching.  As I said on Report Stage, there is a diversity of views on the function of the body to be established under this Act.  I promised at that time to consult widely on the matter with a view to making a balanced provision which respects the views of all the parties. Since undertaking that consultation this provision has been encapsulated in these two amendments. Essentially they provide, in addition to its original functions in relation to teaching through Irish as set out in the Bill as drafted, that the body will be responsible for planning and co-ordinating the provision of text books and aids in relation to the learning and teaching of Irish and will have an advisory and research function in relation to the teaching of Irish.  Its function in this regard will be carried out by a committee of the body and such committee must be established by the committee for this purpose.  I hope this will meet the differing needs of the various partners.  I take this opportunity to thank them all for their views as expressed to me.  I am confident that with all of us working together the body and the committee can contribute in no small measure to the ongoing development of the Irish language.

      <P>This Bill is a significant improvement on the one which he first circulated, particularly in respect of greater recognition of special educational needs where we have made significant progress, although some would say there is still a long way to go.

It shows us that this is an issue which generates interest and commitment from Members of the House.  I also thank the Minister's officials.  I do not know how many hours they clocked up.  Surveys give an indication of how many hours we spend shaving or doing other things.  Some officials will now be able to say that the Education Bill accounted for an important slice of their life.  I hope that at the end of the day we have created something that will be a worthwhile mark for the long-term future of education.</P>

It has been a great privilege for me to introduce this Bill, to deliver it and to develop it through the House as Minister for Education and Science.  I thank Deputies Bruton and O'Shea in particular for their very sincere and extraordinary commitment to the process.  It has been a very long process, but a very worthwhile one.  They gave much time and effort to doing research and producing new amendments.  It is a much improved Bill. Looking at what happened in this House and the other House one can see definitive amendments which had the effect of improving the Bill quite immeasurably.  It has been a good learning experience for me, being my first major Bill as Minister.</P>
      <P>This is the culmination of a long process going back many years &mdash; my immediate predecessor had to put up with me in Opposition and all the deliberation and consultation.  I thank all the previous Ministers going back to the original decision of the current Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, as Minister for Education at the beginning of the decade in 1991, to give statutory underpinning to the education system.  It has been a long process since then including Green Papers, White Papers, conventions and so on.  I thank all my predecessors who made notable contributions to the process.  I thank also the partners in education who consulted and gave much of their time and expertise and brought much of it to bear on the ultimate shape and content of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Finally, I thank the officials of my Department, many of whom, because of our procedures in this House, had to stay up until 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. and get up again at 7 a.m. to process replies and check the validity or otherwise of amendments.  We often do not take cognisance of the pressure we put on officials through our systems.  I thank them sincerely for their contribution.  We can celebrate the arrival of Christmas with the conclusion of this Bill in this House.  It has been a great experience, but a long and tough one from the officials' perspective and I thank them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I praise Deputy Browne for the time and effort he has put into bringing this Bill forward.  The principle of the Bill is a good one and one which has aroused public interest in recent years.</P>
      <P>I have a personal interest as I was an account holder with Irish Permanent and when it converted to a plc I received 300 free shares.  In the intervening years I received two allocations of 15 shares so I now have approximately 330 Irish Permanent plc shares.  This illustrates the point.  I received the shares &mdash; my wife did not get half of them.  I received the full amount, lock, stock and barrel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFleming" hpid="Mr. Fleming Mr. Fleming">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fleming</NameTxt>
      <P>In the intervening years, all other items of correspondence from Irish Permanent plc have been addressed to both of us.  In the past week I received a letter addressed to Mr. Seán G. Fleming and Mary B. Fleming, &ldquo;Silveracre&rdquo;, Castletown, Portlaoise, County Laois.  This letter was about insurance.  When there is a change in the interest rate, a year end statement or if someone is in the unfortunate position of being in arrears, notices will be sent out in both persons' names.  However, we were surprised I received the shares.  The same applied to First National Building Society, which is now called First Active.</P>
      <P>I remember this issue came to light some years ago when a lady called Muriel Scorer tried to get on the board of Irish Permanent through election by the members at the AGM.  She had done all the groundwork she thought was necessary.  She contacted a number of people, including ladies she understood to be account holders.  She duly got nomination papers and many of her friends and colleagues completed them and returned them in good faith, to find that when it came to the AGM they were adjudicated to be out of order because most of them had been signed by women who were second names on the account. They were deemed ineligible as valid nominations. She discussed the matter at length on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;.  Like all good stories, there is a happy ending.  In recent years she became a member of the board of Irish Permanent plc.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiments behind the Bill, I have a number of difficulties with its narrow focus.  Under current legislation account holders decide who should be the first name on the account and thereby agree to whom the shares should be issued, if that is the case.  The Bill is good but simplistic in its approach.  It does not take due cognisance of other difficulties which may arise.  I do not favour piecemeal legislation to deal with issues such as this when there are broader issues affecting building societies and financial institutions which could be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I would like to get some more information before we discuss this legislation further.  The onus should be put on financial institutions and building societies to see if they can take measures at administrative level within their organisations to deal with this problem, instead of having to do it through legislation.  Only if they fail to do this should legislation be necessary.</P>
    <P>What has the Ombudsman for financial and credit institutions said on this issue?  Have there been insurmountable problems with which the industry has been unwilling to deal?  If there have not, the first port of call should be the building societies who should deal with them in the first instance.  As regards the administrative aspect, I do not know why two accounts cannot be opened and then linked in the computer system for other financial purposes.  I ask building societies to take this administrative approach.</P>
    <P>I would like to be given more facts on this issue.  How many joint account holders are there in remaining building societies on whom this could have an impact?  This information should be available to us before we introduce legislation, on the basis of what appears to be a valid objective, without knowing the exact number of people it affects.  I would like to get that information before we go further with this legislation.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Howlin speak on this yesterday. He spent most of his time talking about other difficulties as regards building societies. This undermined the good work done by Deputy Browne.  The clear implication of Deputy Howlin's contribution was that there are many other issues to be dealt with as regards building societies and this Bill was a minor detail in his contribution.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of those glaring difficulties &mdash; first, high interest rates and arrears. When a person falls into arrears they immediately incur draconian penalties.  It has recently been brought to my attention and it has been published in the national media that when a person who has a mortgage misses a couple of months' payments and is £1,000 in arrears they are charged a penal interest rate in relation to the original total capital sum borrowed, which might be £50,000.  They are not only charged a penal rate in respect of the arrears but also in respect of the total loan, the vast majority of which is not in arrears.  This is an issue I would like to see dealt with in any legislation regarding building societies and financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin also referred to the excessive interest rate charged by the Housing Finance Agency.  One has to be refused by commercial institutions before one can qualify for a Housing Finance Agency loan.  The rates charged are exorbitant when one looks at the rates currently available elsewhere.  I would also like to examine the impact of the euro on these matters.  We should look at this before we go ahead with any detailed legislation.</P>
    <P>This brings us back to the big issue &mdash; the number of people requiring public housing and <Col N="1247" /> affordable housing for young people.  In the past week Laois County Council has had to pay £940,000 for 12 acres of land in Portlaoise so it can provide public and private housing in the next couple of years.  This might be seen as good value for money by Dublin standards.  However, in terms of a county like Laois, it is an exorbitant figure.  However, it is a clear indication of the pressure on the housing market.  These are the issues we should be looking at when discussing building societies and financial institutions.  We should be providing loans for people trying to get houses.</P>
    <P>This debate has highlighted the need for a financial services regulator.  The Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service has discussed this matter at length.  I am pleased that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, are bringing forward joint proposals for a financial services regulator. This is a classic issue for referral to that office when it is established, hopefully in 1999.  I would only support legislation if that cannot be resolved satisfactorily.  The intention is good but the legislation is premature.  It may be possible to solve the problems referred to by Deputy Browne through administrative approaches by building societies rather than bringing forward legislation.</P>

      <P>I declare an interest as I am a shareholder in First Active.  When it became a plc I, like many other borrowers, benefited from a certain allocation of free shares.  Deputy Browne should be commended for bringing the Bill before the House as it affords us all an opportunity to focus on mutual and plc building societies. Supply and demand in the housing market is going through a period of significant change.  As with all such legislation, one must consider its implications not only for building societies which become plcs, but in terms of the precedents it will set and its knock-on effect for other financial institutions.  For this reason it might be prudent to give more time for consideration of some of the proposals contained in the Bill before they are formally put through the Oireachtas.  In his response last night, the Minister indicated he is prepared to consider some of the underlying objectives set out in the Bill.  Clearly, this will involve consultation with the Attorney General, other Departments and the Central Bank.  I am sure we will have further legislative opportunities to incorporate the changes set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>We must remember that only two building societies have become plcs, Irish Permanent and First National.  It is not certain that any of the other building societies will consider going down that road.  Naturally they will allow some time to pass in order to evaluate and assess the impact of demutualisation on the two societies to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably there are pitfalls in legislation such as this.  Today the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Dr. Woods, introduced <Col N="1248" /> changes to foreshore legislation.  The Fisheries and Foreshore Act was introduced only in 1997, not 30 or 40 years ago.  When it was given effect, defects came to the fore and it was necessary, because of the importance and relevance of it to the aquaculture industry, to make adjustments to rectify the problems identified.</P>
    <P>Under current procedures in building societies there is one vote per member.  Clearly, a change to allow joint account holders an entitlement to shareholding would result in two votes.  It appears that those with one name on an account would be at an immediate disadvantage and this could lead to all kinds of difficulties in terms of decision making in plcs.  Also, the procedures which would apply would have implications for some of the Company Acts.  This would in turn have implications for various companies and credit unions. Another issue would be the constitutional implication for account holders, as some account holders would have more favourable voting rights than single account holders.  Similarly, there would be a knock on effect in terms of property rights.  I do not know if the Deputy who moved the Bill has had an opportunity to seek constitutional advice, but it would be important to consider this matter and to tease out the knock-on implications, if any, well in advance of the provisions being given legislative effect.</P>
    <P>The cost of house building has escalated, particularly but not exclusively in Dublin, primarily because of the market forces of supply and demand.  The demographic changes which have taken place are quite unprecedented.  Six or seven years ago nobody could predict that we would have the level of economic growth we now enjoy and that the knock on demographic changes would cause a very significant increase in the demand for housing units.  Recent statistics indicate there may be 40,000 house completions in the current year.  Only those who are buying a home for themselves can say whether this is adequate to meet the demand in the market place.</P>
    <P>On foot of the recent Bacon report the Government has taken a number of steps which I hope will take the over-heating out of the housing market.  I am concerned by the cost of some houses in different parts of the country.  The immediate question which springs to mind is the employment position of couples buying houses. There would certainly need to be no economic downturn for a long number of years as couples who buy houses undertake a huge financial burden by any standards.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago there was a crisis in the housing market in Britain when many people found themselves dropping below the negative equity threshold.  I am not anticipating that this will happen here, but I am concerned that many people on low and middle incomes might find themselves effectively excluded from the housing market. Many of the arrangements under social housing are very worthwhile, but all these things are constantly evolving.  I am sure the Department of the <Col N="1249" /> Environment and Local Government, particularly the Minister and the Minister of State, are keeping it under constant review.  It is important this is done.  It would be very serious if we reached a point where local authority housing lists became so long year after year without us making a real impact on reducing them.</P>
    <P>The cost of building land is a major problem. It is only when the current supply and demand situation arises that we can afford to speculate on what would be if we decided in the past, when building land was more available and much cheaper to buy, to give local authorities the financial empowerment to acquire larger blocks of land.  What would this have meant for many people today?  It is not realistic to speculate on local authorities being given the necessary financial empowerment to buy building land at present.  It is off putting for local authorities to see some of the prices being demanded for building land in my constituency.  Like everything else, I am sure these matters are cyclical and change will come.  I hope the lessons we have learned going through this phase of housing provision will be put to good effect.</P>

      <P>I join previous speakers who complimented Deputy Browne on taking the initiative to introduce this Bill.  The preparation of any legislation is difficult and time consuming. It is opportune that we have time to debate not only this specific point, but to broaden the issue. I have been told that because of serious deficiencies in the Bill and the fact it could have wide ranging adverse application, the Government will oppose it for reasons spelled out by the Minister of State last night and other speakers since then.</P>
      <P>However, I commend Deputy Browne on introducing the Bill and hope his objective can be achieved.  As Deputy Fleming said, it is a small aspect of building society regimes with which we must deal and include in legislation in the future.</P>
      <P>People target and identify with politicians and come to them with their grievances.  The issue about which people are most aggrieved is the instant millionaires who emerge following the amalgamation of building societies and when they become plcs.  It appeared there was a cosy relationship among individuals who were able to make companies public and give themselves a minimum of £1 million along the way.  The public find it very difficult to understand how that can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Explanations about good business and practice were given but I have a fairly fundamental approach to the issue in that money must come from some source.  If a person gets £1 million through shares or any other arrangement, someone else must pay.  At the end of the day, it is the customer who pays.  These companies do not make money any other way other than through charges imposed on their customers.  That has been the greatest negative reaction I have heard to the amalgamation of building societies and their rationalisation.  I have been worried by it <Col N="1250" /> and thank Deputy Browne for giving me this opportunity to raise this matter in the Chamber. People, including business people, are astonished that can happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State gave a number of instances where these items can be addressed and I hope this matter will be looked at also.  There is no such thing as instant money and somebody must be creaming it off.  I do not mind anybody getting a fair reward for a good commercial achievement but the golden handshakes are way over the top and certainly result in a negative reaction.</P>
    <P>There has also been a negative reaction to the recent spate of court cases and actions emerging from the repossession of property or homes.  This has been an indictment of some of the institutions. Just as I intensely dislike people generalising about politicians and lumping them together, I do not believe I should place all building societies in the one basket.  A pattern is emerging among the financial institutions whereby the public is totally unprotected, whether they are customers of large or small banks, building societies or a lending agency.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  Both committees tried to ascertain the protection for individuals with the lending agencies, but there is none.  We even went as far as the Governor of the Central Bank to try to ascertain who polices the banks or who minds the minder as it were.  It is a totally open market for these people.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fleming mentioned, we made a recommendation and have looked at situations in other countries.  A pattern is developing throughout the European Union as regards the creation of regulatory bodies for financial institutions. They are all emerging for the same reason &mdash; malpractice or unsavory practices.  We are seeing the same pattern emerge here.  There is a need for further legislation, whether through the regulatory body or elsewhere, and I am sure it will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned about the consumer. During the past week I looked for a package for the house purchaser, the main client of the building societies.  It is a jungle out there particularly for the first time buyer who is inexperienced and who is usually dealing with the legal profession, which has its codes and fine high standard of practice, for the first time.  They will also deal with engineers, money lenders and various other issues such as insurance.  I looked for a package to simplify the situation for the buyer in areas such as searches and insurance protection.  If we had a code of practice, we could include building societies.</P>
    <P>I am all for a voluntary code where it can be applied, whether by the CIF or the building societies.  I got an assurance from the Cork branch of the CIF that it has no intention of allowing the gazumping which happened in County Kildare and parts of Dublin to happen in <Col N="1251" /> Cork.  It is a voluntary code of practice and the Cork branch are a fine and decent bunch of people.  They have assured that there will not be a need to go beyond that voluntary code.</P>
    <P>We need to debate such issues and to do so, we need people like Deputy Browne to introduce Bills and table motions.  I compliment him on the Bill.  However, we will vote against it and I am sure he will understand and accept the reasons for that, as he would any good judgment in this House.  I hope he will accept the goodwill and support of the Minister of State and the good intentions behind his rejection of the Bill.  He promised the matter will be looked at positively.</P>
    <P>Members have used this opportunity to broaden the debate on building and the Bacon report.  &ldquo;Density&rdquo; seems to be a popular word at present.  I fear that we will go back to the bad dark days of the 1960s which gave us the high rise monstrosities and the problems on which we are spending tens of millions of pounds rectifying.  I hope we will not return to that era and that people will have a little common sense.  I am sure the Minister of State will oversee this matter along with his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.  I use this opportunity to appeal to people not to throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>
    <P>The critical issue is the zoning of a sufficient amount of land.  Some people have adopted the high moral ground on this issue.  It is amazing that this is not a great difficulty in County Cork, which is the largest county, and where people can deal with questions like zoning and no accusations are made against individuals.  It seems to be endemic in Dublin city and county.  Once sufficient land is zoned, there is a suggestion of malpractice.  I appeal to public representatives to ensure land is zoned for young people.  That is what will prevent the occurrence here of the negative equity trap which occurred in the UK.  It is an issue which public representatives must confront, especially in the Dublin and Kildare regions.  Without land, prices will soar.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Browne on the legislation. I like to see people take the initiative on issues and I wish him well in having it implemented in the next session.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Browne on introducing this innovative Bill.  The 1989 Act needed updating because it is hugely discriminatory. Since building societies went public, they have become cash driven and devoid of sentiment. It is a huge anomaly that, when they issued shares on becoming public, both signatories to a mortgage were not entitled to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> The Director of Consumer Affairs has written to all banks and building societies seeking written assurance about their charges and fees.  He has ordered his staff to begin spot checks of bank branches to ensure they are not overcharging customers. The 1989 Act needs updating in the area of bank charges, especially as regards building societies, because so much has happened in the interim.  By law, financial institutions can now only impose charges already notified to the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>It is disheartening to hear how much complaints about overcharging by credit institutions add to the work of the Ombudsman.  Revelations of overcharging by financial institutions prompted a huge increase of 28 per cent in complaints against banks, building societies and other credit institutions.  Complaints to the Ombudsman, who is an independent arbitrator on disputes between financial institutions and their customers, have increased from 1,033 to 1,321.  Of these, 29 per cent related to the operation of accounts by banks and building societies, including errors in statements, fees charged and interest rates.  Complaints about the operation of mortgage accounts were also prominent, accounting for 27 per cent of the total number of cases brought to the Ombudsman, with a further 20 per cent related to other lending activities.  I am very concerned about that.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing forward the Bill because it is critically important for people who take out a mortgage, especially with the level of house prices.  More than one in ten people fall behind in their mortgage repayments and an average of three houses a week are being repossessed by building societies according to figures compiled by the voluntary housing agency, Threshold.  Its report, As Safe As Houses, warns that more people could fall into arrears and have their homes repossessed as a result of the property boom.  Huge increases in property prices now mean an average new house costs £35,000 more than a person on an average wage can normally borrow.  The 178 repossessions by building societies last year represent a lower rate than in 1995, but are almost twice that of 1990.  The figures speak for themselves.  The Act became law in 1989 and, since 1990, the figure for repossessions has doubled.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to accept Deputy Browne's Bill.  It is important that, when banks are driven by profit, the people entitled to shares receive them.  It is an injustice that both holders of a mortgage from a building society are not entitled to shares when it goes public.  Irish Life, the third largest life insurance company in the country, is amalgamating with Irish Permanent. With the churning of policies and the allegations of corruption surrounding bank charges, the time has come for the 1989 legislation to be updated. I appeal to the Government to examine this attempt in a positive manner.  Some shares are now £10 each which means a single beneficiary is worth £3,000 in some cases.  Divorce legislation <Col N="1253" /> has been introduced since 1989 and I am amazed the Act was not amended then.  It should have been amended in parallel to ensure both signatories to a mortgage receive an entitlement.</P>
    <P>Being in business, I know the pressure couples are under to pay mortgages.  Shares are one of the few benefits one receives from financial institutions because building societies and banks charge for everything.  For example, there is a charge for an additional copy of a statement.  A customer in my supermarket had his cheque for £35 returned and the bank made £15 on it by charging the customer and retailer £7.50 each.  If building societies had any gumption, they would collectively correct the anomaly highlighted by the Bill to ensure everyone benefited.  People gain very little from them so, when they pretend to play Santa Claus by allocating shares, it is a huge injustice that only one signatory to a mortgage benefits.</P>
    <P>The report of the Ombudsman, the revelation that three homes a week are being repossessed and the fact that it seems all the banks are involved suggest the time has come for major regulation in this area.  It is overdue and it surprises me that the 1989 Act was not updated to bring forward changes.  A great deal more could be done with building societies to create more transparency in their dealings with customers. People are mortgaged to the hilt.  In the current housing boom, banks and building society can justify 100 per cent loans and sometimes even more, such is the competition which exists.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine this important amendment to the 1989 Act.  It is a matter of consumer rights, especially as the Ombudsman's office must spend so much time dealing with complaints about financial institutions. In 26 per cent of cases or 348 disputes, the procedures failed to provide a solution and the cases were subsequently referred again to the Ombudsman.  There is a huge level of error, yet people are so heavily mortgaged they are afraid to do anything.  It should also be noted that these are only the complaints referred to the Ombudsman. How many did not go that far?  There is a huge number of people in arrears with their mortgages who cannot question charges.  I believe building societies are indulging in hidden charges and are getting away with charging rates considerably in excess of those used to appeal to new customers.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Browne on introducing this innovative, necessary and timely legislation and I plead with the Government to accept this important amendment to the 1989 Act.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Browne on performing his duty as a legislator and on the quality of the legislation he has produced. However, I have some doubts about the compliments coming from Members on the Government side.  They ring hollow when they initially compliment him and then tell him they will not accept the Bill.  The best compliment they could pay him <Col N="1254" /> is to ensure his Bill becomes law.  Deputy Browne will not say the Bill is perfect.  He has raised a serious issue and has proposed a solution.  We are all aware that Committee Stage is the procedure for dealing with deficiencies in a Bill.  That is the procedure I have used since I came to this House 20 years ago.  Why will the Government not use it in connection with this Bill?  If there are difficulties or deficiencies let us discuss them on Committee Stage.  The fundamental question is whether the Minister accepts the principle of the Bill.  As of now it appears the Government does not accept it.</P>
      <P>We have heard much about the problems and the launch of the building societies.  I was amused by the Minister of State, Deputy Dennehy, who raised the serious issue of instant millionaires emerging from some of the flotations.  The procedure for dealing with instant millionaires, people who get money for jam, is tax.  That was the procedure until yesterday.  We now have the zero tax regime.</P>
      <P>I invite the Government to use the Committee Stage procedure for dealing with Deputy Browne's Bill and the normal tax procedure.  Let us get away from the zero tax approach, which appears to be the hallmark of this Government, to the normal tax procedure where people pay their tax in the normal way.  I am not concerned about the position of instant millionaires.  Deputy Browne may deal with that point on another day, particularly if the zero tax approach continues. He is concerned about the people who got nothing on the flotations.  There is an attempt to suggest that has happened only to a few people. The Minister admitted that upwards of 50 per cent of all accounts are joint.  I am aware from my experience as a lawyer and a politician that in those 50 per cent of cases, virtually every single account has the woman in second place.  Almost invariably the male dominance emerges when it comes to opening accounts.  I will lay a bet since we do not have to pay tax on bets any more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that in nearly all cases the women will suffer because of this anomaly.  Does the Minister realise the position?  Does he realise he is effectively supporting discrimination against women by shooting down this Bill?  If I may coin a phrase, instead of the Minister being known as &ldquo;Wallace for women&rdquo;, he will be known as &ldquo;Danny the discriminator&rdquo;.  That is a fate I do not wish on him but that will be the outcome of his approach because this is clear discrimination against women.  Given that the Minister of State is an old friend of mine I would hate to see him labelled in that fashion.  In his own interest I suggest he review his decision forthwith and ensure the Bill goes through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much lip service is paid to the question of equality of women.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to show whether he is for or against it. The situation that now exists clearly discriminates <Col N="1255" /> against women.  In virtually all cases of joint accounts, the women got nothing from previous flotations because the second name was that of the wife.  What will the Government do about it? Deputy Browne has highlighted the anomaly and produced a Bill.  The Government's response is a hollow compliment to him.  It will look into the matter and in the meantime shoot down the Bill. That is the wrong approach.  The correct approach would be to approve the Bill in principle on Second Stage and to refer it to a committee where I have no doubt Deputy Browne would be most accommodating in regard to any amendments the Government considered necessary to tighten up its provisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about effecting the decision-making process.  Anybody who knows anything about building societies and plc AGMs knows that is not the issue.  He referred to the Constitution but I have not the time to quote the Constitution.  I could make a case that it is unconstitutional to continue this discrimination against women.  I could make the case that because of the equality of all citizens before the law and under the Constitution, this discrimination is unconstitutional and the Minister's position is unconstitutional. Time does not permit me to dwell on it in any more detail.  The Minister has thrown the Constitution and the kitchen sink into his arguments to stop this Bill.  It is unworthy of the Minister to adopt that approach.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not in the interest of my friend and colleague Deputy Browne who has done this House and the nation a service in producing the Bill but in the interest of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to ensure the Bill goes through.  Otherwise there is a fate in store for him: the chance to be known as &ldquo;Wallace for women&rdquo; will be gone and he will be known as &ldquo;Danny the discriminator&rdquo; henceforth.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy John Browne who introduced this Bill.  He has been in the House for many years and is a man of culture and class.  He quotes regularly from Shakespeare and so on.  I like to listen to and learn from him.  This is a matter which I thought about because a number of constituents came to me in recent months arising from the flotation of the building society. I did not realise there was a problem until a widow came to me from the Newport area.  She made a strong point about this.  She wrote to every TD in County Mayo, the Minister and the Taoiseach because she was outraged to find that, although she held a joint account with her husband, when he died the shares were not passed on to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland we always believed in the family.  We always preached and talked about the family.  In <Col N="1256" /> every household throughout the country, whether it was the family land, the family car or the family account it was in the father's name.  That is how we were taught and that is how it was until recently.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government does not see fit to accept this Bill.  The same applied with the <i>pro rata</i> pensions.  When something is wrong it should be fixed and legislation should be brought before the House.  Deputy Browne has introduced legislation to rectify a genuine problem. It should be corrected.  The Government is rejecting that Bill.  That is wrong.  In my opinion building societies will be challenged in the future and legislation will have to be put in place to deal with existing problems.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of comments about banks, building societies and supermarkets.  To quote an old saying, &ldquo;the banks give you the umbrella when the sun is shining and they take it away when it starts to rain&rdquo;.  The banks have always been noted for that and the building societies are no different.  I recall a case where the managing director of a building society could have allowed a family to remain in their home. The individual in question is a strong supporter of a political party, but I will not name him.  I contacted his office and discovered that the family also owed money to the banks and a number of other people and they sold property to pay their debts.  Of the five people owed money, four were willing to play ball but the managing director of the building society was not prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>The upshot was that the family were evicted from their house.  For as long as I live or as long as I am involved in politics, I will never forget the moment when the father contacted me by phone on the morning in question and I heard his children crying in the background.  I immediately came into the Dáil and attempted to raise the matter, but to no avail.  I tried to contact the managing director of the building society, but he would not talk to me.  He behaved like an animal. All he wanted was his pound of flesh, he was interested in nothing more than pounds, shillings and pence.  The four other parties involved played ball but this individual would not do so.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to financial charges.  If a woman entered a supermarket tomorrow and stole two pounds of sugar and one pound of butter because she needed them, the local Garda sergeant would arrest and detain her to appear in court.  If a contrary judge heard the case and the woman refused to pay for what she had stolen, she might be sentenced to a week in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have been robbed by the supermarkets, the banks and the building societies in respect of charges.  I will provide an example to prove my point.  Last week an individual who is well known to me bought one pound of rashers in her local supermarket.  For the sake of argument, let us say the rashers cost £3. However, when she went home the woman <Col N="1257" /> checked her receipt and discovered she had been charged £22 for the rashers.  She returned to the supermarket the next day and, to be fair, the manager accepted there was a problem.  He took the rashers, scanned them at the checkout and was given three different prices for them.  The woman was fortunate because the management rectified the situation.  However, what happens in cases where people do not check their receipts?</P>
    <P>There is a need to introduce legislation to deal with problems involving scanners, bar codes, supermarkets, banks and other institutions.  If the institutions to which I refer make mistakes &mdash; I accept everyone makes mistakes &mdash; they must pay the penalty.  What is the difference between a woman who steals some rashers and a supermarket checkout attendant who &mdash; perhaps because he or she is hungover from the night before or because he or she is not good at mathematics -rings up a sale as £22.20 instead of £2.20?  The only difference is that the woman who stole the rashers will be prosecuted while the supermarket employee will be protected.  That is wrong.  It is time legislation was introduced to deal with these serious problems.  If people caught stealing are prosecuted, supermarkets which make mistakes or overcharge must also be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>I grew up in a working class housing estate.  I have said on many occasions that there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.  A poor man once said to me &ldquo;Mr. Ring, it does not matter whether you support Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour because if a rich man's son gets into trouble he will be looked after by his own kind.&rdquo; We saw an example of that today.  I appeal to members of the Judiciary to be as lenient with poor people who commit petty theft as they have been with certain other individuals.</P>
    <P>To return to the Bill, there is an injustice in existence at present.  We have always preached about the family and, as stated earlier, despite the fact that husbands traditionally owned the family land, car or bank account, these were always understood to be owned jointly by other members of the family.  What is happening at present is wrong and I appeal to the Minister to accept the Bill.  If amendments are required, they can be introduced on Committee Stage.  I compliment Deputy Browne on bringing the Bill before the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unbelievable that if a man signs on the dotted line first, he immediately makes his wife a second class citizen.  If, as Deputy Browne stated, he is well bred and allows his wife to sign first, he signs away his rights.  What happens when the building societies encounter problems and the <Col N="1258" /> spouse who signed first is away from home?  That happened in the case highlighted by Deputy Browne.  The person who signed for the mortgage did not pay the bills but the building society was happy to accept their money.  If the spouse had not paid, the building society would have expected the first person it found living in the house to do so.  The building society was able to uncover the long lost husband when it wanted to issue shares to him.</P>
    <P>The Bill is so straightforward that the Minister of State and his party, which has preached about equality for a long period, should accept it.  If, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe stated, there are flaws they can be rectified on Committee Stage.  However, there is no need to throw out the baby with the bath water.  The Minister of State is merely being asked to recognise that the two people who sign for a house &mdash; they may be married, living together with the intention of getting married or living together as partners &mdash; have equal rights.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister of State indicated he was concerned about the costs involved in ensuring that computer files, documents, etc., were corrected. At a meeting a number of years ago a civil servant in the then Department of Agriculture informed me it could not pay out sizable grants to farmers because it did not have time to do so. However, before we left the meeting, the Minister agreed to introduce a £5 fodder or fertiliser scheme.  This should be paid by Teagasc.  All the information is on computer.  The Minister's excuse, therefore, is a lame one.  He should support the Bill and ensure the matter is rectified.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State was generous in his compliments to Deputy Browne for raising the issue.  He gave a firm assurance that the Government will consider how the objective of equitable subdivision of share entitlements for joint accounts might be secured and indicated that if this can best be achieved through a legislative response, the possibility of including appropriate provisions in legislation will be looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to consider the wider context in which the changes proposed would have implications. Some of the comments made by Opposition speakers indicate a lack of appreciation that, while issues with wide-ranging implications have been raised, the Bill would apply only to three financial institutions. The Irish Permanent was mentioned.  The Irish Permanent is now a bank rather than a building society.  If legislation were to be introduced to address the issues which have been raised, this would have to be considered in the <Col N="1259" /> wider context of banking law and the Companies Acts.</P>
    <P>The Government has been criticised for not addressing the issue.  Five parties have participated in Government since the enactment of the Building Societies Act, 1989.  Few Members are in a position, therefore, to take the high moral ground on this matter.  The reason that none of the Opposition parties addressed the matter in Government is that it is not as straightforward as some would have us believe.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between the broad objective of equality and the principles of the Bill. Some suggested that any defects in the Bill might be capable of being rectified by amendment and that the Government should be prepared to agree to its passage through Second Stage on this basis. They appear to have missed the important point that, although there may be a desirable policy objective, the approach proposed to achieve it is flawed.  It has been acknowledged that the broad objective of securing equality between the parties to a joint account is a laudable one.  The approach on which the Bill is based is flawed.  Accepting the Bill on Second Stage and rectifying its defects in committee is not an option.</P>
    <P>There are technical defects which may be rectified in committee but that is not the basis on which the Government is opposing its Second Reading.  The crux of the matter is that, while purporting to seek greater equality between joint account holders in building societies, the Bill would create new inequalities between these and other members of a society and adversely affect their rights and entitlements.  Such a scenario has significant constitutional implications.  It was surprising that some Members adopted a rather cavalier attitude to this issue almost implying that this was a ploy on the part of the Government rather than a fundamental criterion of the acceptability in principle of a legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>There is a question to be answered as to whether legislation is likely to be the most effective approach to address the issue.  It was disappointing that a number of Opposition speakers were prepared to turn a deaf ear to the significant practical difficulties the approach proposed in the Bill would create.  That legal and practical issues would arise not only in relation to building societies but also companies, credit unions and other shareholding organisations which operate under statutory procedures compounds the seriousness of the implications which the Bill would provoke.</P>
    <P>I will give a simple illustration of how the Bill could result in serious inequalities and encroachment on the rights of many building society shareholders. In the case of a person who has £1,000 invested in a share account with a building society and four people who have each invested £250 in a joint account each account carries one vote under existing legislation.  The effect of the Bill would be that the vote of single account holders would be reduced to one fourth, that of the joint account.  This would result in a significant diminution <Col N="1260" /> of the rights attaching to single account holders and represent a glaring inequity which would be compounded throughout the membership of the society.</P>
    <P>A further example of the serious flaws in the Bill's approach is that it does not address the specific objective of achieving an equal subdivision of the share entitlement due to a joint account in the event of conversion to plc status.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>The Bill would likely cause a fundamental alteration of the basis on which the share entitlement attaching to each account would be determined resulting in a multiplication of the share issues to joint accounts with corresponding dilution of the entitlements of single account holders.  It would also lead to a situation in which there would be an open invitation and a strong incentive for those with manipulative intentions towards building societies, as happened in the United Kingdom.  This would not be in the interests of the mutual building society movement or the continuation of a diverse and competitive mortgage market.  The ultimate loser would be the house buying borrower.</P>
      <P>A common theme running through many of the contributions of Opposition speakers was the attempt to gloss over the flaws in the Bill with populist rhetoric about equality and, in some instances, disingenuous insinuations about gender imbalance in the Building Societies Act.  Not only does this ignore that the arrangements which have been called into question, for example in relation to voting rights, are a fundamental principle in shareholding under the Companies Acts and other codes, it also fails to recognise that the opening of a joint account is a voluntary decision. The Building Societies Act provides a specific right for the parties to a joint account to determine the order of names and to change it at any time.  It is not the case that where one party signs first the other is permanently excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be desirable to examine whether there is a need to make persons opening joint accounts more aware of the procedures relating to these accounts, including the position on conversions. This could most effectively be pursued with the societies without introducing fundamental changes in legislation which could have far-reaching and potentially damaging implications.  There was also an attempt to paint a very alarmist scenario about the danger of second named account holders being kept in the dark about their <Col N="1261" /> accounts and a suggestion that if the first named failed to meet his or her obligations a serious arrears situation might be allowed to build up without the other person's knowledge.  This is based on a very narrow and selective portrayal of the legislative provisions and ignores the reality of what happens in practice.  The fact is that building societies, as a general practice, make considerable efforts to ensure that second parties to a joint account are provided with important information relating to their accounts including regular statements.  For example, it is the normal practice to address correspondence relating to mortgage accounts to both joint holders.  More-over, where difficulties such as arrears arise, societies make special efforts to contact the second party and it is the practice to interview both parties before any proceedings are instituted.  An important point to note here is that problems of arrears are not, in practice, always attributable to default on the part of the first named account holder.  Quite often the other party is the one responsible for paying bills and it can happen that this person fails to make repayments without the knowledge of the other.  In such circumstances, the practical measures which societies take to ensure that both parties are contacted are far more effective than any legislative measures.  It is also worth pointing out that the rate of repossessions in this country is extremely low &mdash; much lower, for example, than in the UK.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin raised the issue of borrowers with relatively high fixed interest rate loans from local authorities.  Generally speaking, fixed rate local authority house purchase or improvement loans have not issued since 1 December 1987. While these interest rates may look high compared to today's rates, when they first issued and indeed for many years subsequently, they were below the market rates.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, borrowers with fixed rate local authority mortgages are free to redeem them at any time without any interest rate penalty and if they wish, refinance them at the lower rate now available in the private sector.  This is an important concession which would not be available with private sector fixed rate loans.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government will, as suggested by Deputy Howlin, write to local authorities requesting them to notify borrowers of this option.</P>
    <P>Some speakers sought to trivialise the cost implications of the Bill.  The suggestion appears to be that building societies can well afford it and a comment was even made to the effect that they could easily recoup the cost by increasing their rates.  The reality is that additional costs which, as the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace pointed out, could arise well beyond the building society sector if the principle in the Bill was accepted, would ultimately bear on members of building societies and other institutions and on consumers. Some of the sentiments that have been voiced pay scant regard to the interests of affordability for people trying to purchase their homes, or commitment <Col N="1262" /> to business competitiveness which will be increasingly vital in the context of monetary union.</P>
    <P>The problems that have emerged in relation to this Bill can be summarised in terms of a gulf between the broad objective that it purports to achieve and the reality of what it would result in. This Bill simply would not achieve the objective of securing equality between the parties to a particular joint account.  Instead, it would have a range of undesirable consequences both in relation to building societies and much further afield.  It would, in the process, create significant constitutional difficulties arising from the basic approach on which it is founded which makes it impossible for the Government to accept it as a valid legislative approach even in principle.</P>
    <P>The Minister, however, has undertaken to examine how the valid objectives underlying the Bill can best be secured without creating the sort of significant legal and practical difficulties which the Bill involves.  If this means legislation then the House has an assurance that the necessary proposals will be considered in consultation with the other relevant interests and having regard to the implications of other codes such as the companies Acts which have much wider application than the Building Societies Act.  This is a reasonable approach and in the circumstances the only sensible option to ensure a workable solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share my time with Deputy John Browne.  I congratulate Deputy Browne on bringing before the House an important an symbolic Bill.  I am pleased to discuss it with your illustrious presence in the Chair.  Now that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is assuming the Chair even more lustre is added to the occasion.</P>
      <P>This measure is one which any sensible Government would have welcomed, accepted and allowed to pass Second Stage without the parties dividing.  Any technical changes which the Government parties sought could have been included on Committee Stage.  It is appropriate that we address this measure this evening when there are so many women in the public gallery of the House, many of whom I recognise from my constituency of Dublin South.  They will be amazed to learn what the substance of this legislation is and that the Government is opposing it.</P>
      <P>This Bill does a very simple thing.  It seeks to ensure that where a family home is held in the joint names of husband and wife and where there is a building society mortgage, if the building society floats and goes public any shares made available to the members of the society are shared equally between husband and wife. Apparently the view of the Fianna Fáil party is that shares should not be shared equally between husband and wife and that primarily they should go to husbands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought such an approach had been abandoned by the Members of this House years ago.  That is the effective position taken by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in voting against this Bill.  Two building societies, Irish Permanent and First Active, have floated.  By and large when mortgages are taken out on properties which are in joint names the building society writes the husband's name down first and the wife's second.  That has been my experience as a Member of this House and as a legal practitioner and family lawyer.  If Mr. and Mrs. Bloggs take out a mortgage with a building society the first named borrower will usually be Mr. Bloggs and the second named Mrs. Bloggs. When the Irish Permanent and First National which became First Active floated, the shares which were issued in the context of joint mortgages all issued to the first named person on the mortgage.  It would be correct to estimate that where the mortgages were in joint names, in 90 per cent of instances, the shares issued to the husband alone.  Where a marriage is happy and there are no difficulties between husband and wife and they operate under true financial partnership, no difficulty was created.  Trouble arose where there were family difficulties.  Deserted wives living in family homes held in joint names found that the deserting husband got the shares and the wife, left in the home looking after the children not only did not get the shares but was furthermore told by the building society that she had no entitlement to them.  This meant she did not have the opportunity to realise the windfall benefit of the shares and sell them.  It meant that if the shares were retained she had no entitlement to the annual dividend paid to shareholders.  The current law in this area is an ass and has failed to keep up to date with the partnership view which we now have of marriage and the view that women deserve to be treated equally with men which we have articulated in many other areas in this House.  Neither deserves to be regarded as superior to the other, each should be treated equally.  Many mortgage holders tend not to involve themselves in this to any great degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other practical consequence of this in which many mortgage holders tend not to become involved to any great degree is that when it comes to voting on whether a building society should go public the only persons to whom voting cards are issued are those who are named first on the mortgage, and in 90 per cent of instances that is the husband.  That is completely wrong.  When a family home is held in joint names and there is a joint mortgage, there is no practical reason, when there is a public flotation, that a husband and wife should not have a joint share or a joint beneficial ownership in the shares that are issued.  There is no reason a husband and wife should not have an equal 50 per cent entitlement to dividends paid under those shares.  There is also no reason wives should be generally excluded from voting at annual general meetings of building societies or from voting on whether their society should <Col N="1264" /> maintain its mutuality status or become a publicly quoted company.</P>
    <P>I read, with some astonishment and amazement, the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, in this House last night.  Normally I would not reveal confidential discussions that take place between colleagues, but yesterday evening Deputy Browne and I discussed what the Government would say about this Bill.  Having brought 15 Private Members' Bills before the House, I am familiar with the mantra that is usually wheeled out by Government Departments, when they consider Deputies are impudently attempting to act as legislators as opposed to simply lobby fodder and they want to deflect legislation and prevent it being enacted.  I was subjected to that mantra in respect of 11 of the Private Members' Bills I introduced, but within 12 to 18 months Bills practically identical to mine were subsequently published by the Government of the day which addressed issues it had previously said could not be properly addressed.</P>
    <P>The first mantra is that this Bill could possibly be unconstitutional, but that is balderdash.  In so far as the current provisions in the Building Societies Act discriminate against some mortgage holders, they could be found to be unconstitutional. It is only because such a challenge has not been brought that the issue has not been addressed comprehensively by our courts.  In no circumstance could legislation which seeks to provide equality between a husband and a wife be regarded as unconstitutional.  It is unfortunate that important constitutional issues are used as asinine political weapons to try to do down practical propositions for legislation that comes from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>It is suggested that if one allowed joint mortgage holders to share in a share issue that, in some way, sole mortgage holders would lose out. That is arrant nonsense.  If I take out a mortgage in my sole name on my home and a building society, when it floats its shares, issues 500 shares to the person who has borrowed funds from it, I would get 500 shares.  Based on that provision, if the mortgage were held by my wife and myself jointly, we would get 250 shares each.  I fail to understand how that would act contrary to the interests of sole mortgage holders.  There is a suggestion that the roof would fall in if husbands and wives were given voting rights and that, in some way, the sole mortgage holder would be done down.</P>
    <P>Mortgages can be for different sums of money. Take a married couple with a mortgage of £60,000 who are each allowed to vote, based on the Minister's analysis that would do great damage to the sole mortgage holder who might have a mortgage of only £30,000 and who has a single vote.  There is not a single credible argument offered by the Government for voting down this legislation.  If the legislation requires technical change, amendments can be tabled on Committee Stage.  A Bill has not been brought before the House by the Government that has been so perfect <Col N="1265" /> that the Minister has not had to amend it on Committee Stage.  This Bill works.  It would right a wrong.  It would give women true equality.  If it were enacted, it would ensure that any women in the Public Gallery, whose company we have the pleasure of this evening, who have shares in Irish Nationwide or who are parties to a mortgage with that building society, would share in the benefits of that building society going public by getting equal ownership of any shares issued.</P>
    <P>We are trying to modernise an archaic area of our law and to brush off the cobwebs of legislative inertia.  The Fianna Fáil Party and Progressive Democrats will vote to maintain women as second class citizens in the area of mortgages. They will vote to deny thousands of married women throughout the length and breadth of this country the entitlement to joint ownership rights in any shares issued by any building society that goes public in the future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: I thank all the Members who took part in this debate, particularly my party colleagues who made a case that justifies the enactment of this Bill.  I have seldom listened to arguments from the Government side that stand up.  I do not blame the Ministers for that.  A script writer somewhere is the son of Sam, the son of the man who brought in the 1989 Act. I checked the Official Report of the Seanad debate on that Bill.  That Bill was introduced when a Government had fallen in 1989 and the Seanad was still in session.  All Stages of the Central Bank Bill and the Building Societies Bill were put through the Seanad on the same day.  That proposal led to the Fine Gael Senators and Independent Senators walking out of the Seanad. Senator Robinson, who arrived a few minutes late, asked about the legality of enacting that legislation.  The then Minister, Pádraig Flynn was acting on behalf of the Minister responsible for this area and Committee and Remaining Stages of the Building Societies Bill were passed with no amendment or discussion.</P>
      <P>I wish to support the case that was ably put by Deputy Shatter.  One cannot be selective about the Constitution.  Women's rights are guarded under it and one cannot pretend otherwise.  The same is the case in regard to the division of shares and votes.  Some Members opposite are convoluted in their thinking and seem to have got only one side of the story.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: That is true. <Col N="1266" /> The thinking opposite is such that there appears to be nothing wrong with depriving a woman, who has £30,000 worth of shares, of a vote.  She will suffer, but she has always suffered and the attitude appears to be that she should continue to suffer.  If three account holders have £10,000 worth of shares, they will get three shares.  That is a marvellous argument to put forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, stated last night that there are significant constitutional doubts.  He said, in particular, the Bill could add substantially to the cost of building societies.  The Government said the same in 1989, but it has not learned anything in this regard since then.  The contribution of the then Minister, Pádraig Flynn focused on the building societies and did not deal with individuals.  I checked the record to see what he said about section 16, but he never mentioned it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Wallace, also said that more systems changes would be needed to collect, verify and record details.  Whoever wrote this rubbish should be taken out?  He also said that this Bill, if enacted, would require fundamental restructuring of computer information and the IT unit, as if computers would go up in flames and building societies offices would be burned out because computers would not be able to deal with the second name of a joint account holder.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, said that would be too costly.  He also said the Bill would add greatly to difficulties in determining share entitlements in the event of a conversion.  One could imagine an official in a building society, with the stub of a pencil, working out that the holders of a joint account are to be given 400 shares and how that could be divided by two or checking if there was a calculator.  That just adds insult to injury.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said the Bill would greatly add to difficulties in determining share entitlements in the event of a conversion.  The building societies can calculate the shares for the one person who is elected, illegally and unconstitutionally but they cannot divide that by two.  The Minister should do something about such logic. The Government is voting against a change which will take away an injustice to women about which I am embarrassed.  I hope the female Members who vote against this Bill also feel embarrassed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 17, after &ldquo;include&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Courts Act, 1996, the Courts Act, 1997, the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1997 (other than sections 3 and 9 thereof) and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I realise that on Committee Stage the Minister stated it was not necessary to include this amendment but, having discussed it with my advisers, I suggest that the Minister look at it again.  Has the Minister changed his view on that matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, I have received advice to the effect that there is no pressing need for this amendment.  I would be more sympathetic if it related to an issue of substance and, in particular, if its non-acceptance were to have adverse implications for the Bill.  This is not the case.  However, I reiterate that I will ensure some appropriate adjustment is made in a Bill which would be more suited to this task.  I thank the Deputy for bringing this matter to my attention.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 18, after &ldquo;Convention&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;; and</P>
      <P>(e) such report (if any) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on the 1996 Accession Convention as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for the purposes of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have resubmitted this amendment despite the fact that the Minister felt it was not necessary.  I did so to ensure he had a second chance to examine whether it was appropriate to be included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, while I appreciate the good intentions which underlie this amendment, the reality is that it is over two years since the accession convention was signed.  At this stage the likelihood of an explanatory report must be remote.  The amendment highlights this regrettable reality.  For the practical reason that I do not think we will ever have to rely on its provisions, I am not disposed towards accepting this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) Where by virtue of any enactment <Col N="1270" /> (including but not limited to section 39 of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996), a court has jurisdiction to entertain proceedings proposed to be brought against a person outside the jurisdiction, but in the particular circumstances of the case the relevant rules of court (including but not limited to Order 11 of the Rules of the Circuit Court, 1950 or Order 11 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1986) do not provide for service of the proposed proceedings or notice thereof out of the jurisdiction against that person, the court may order such service.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the introduction of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  I thank the Minister for his correspondence since I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage.  I also thank him for asking the superior courts to have the matter brought before the superior courts rules committee at an early date.</P>
    <P>However, in resubmitting the amendment, my understanding is that almost 95 per cent of divorce cases take place in the Circuit Court rather than the superior courts.  The Minister has indicated that, under the rules of the Circuit Court, county registrars have powers to issue orders for service out of the jurisdiction and that, as far as he knows, there have not been any problems. However, these rules would only partly include what might emerge under the divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>While I accept there have not been problems to date, the divorce legislation was only recently enacted and problems could arise in the future.  It would be appropriate to include the Family Law (Divorce) Act in this legislation to ensure problems do not arise concerning the jurisdiction of courts in relation to that Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As I promised on Committee Stage, I have made inquiries on the adequacy of the powers available to the Circuit and superior courts to serve documents out of the jurisdiction on any person who is not domiciled in the State.  My advice is that, under Circuit Court rule No. 2 1999, Statutory Instrument No. 155 of 1990, county registrars have the power to issue orders for service out of the jurisdiction.  By virtue of the Second Schedule to the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, such registrars are also empowered to make any order which may be made as of course.</P>
      <P>My information is that this provision enables county registrars to deal with the type of situation which the Deputy's amendment seeks to address. With regard to the superior courts, preliminary inquiries do not indicate that problems have emerged to date.  However, I have asked that the matter be brought to the attention of the superior courts rules committee at an early date.  In these circumstances, I hope the Deputy will understand why I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan" hpid="Ms O'Sullivan Ms O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why we need the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgements Bill concerning other aspects of <Col N="1271" /> law and why the divorce Act is already catered for under the rules of the Circuit Court and the superior court.  It would be appropriate to include this amendment to ensure there are no problems in the future with regard to this specific legislation.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that a large number of cases which will arise under the Family Law (Divorce) Act will involve people living outside the jurisdiction. It is in the nature of marriage separation and potential divorce that people are separated. I am suggesting this amendment in anticipation of future problems.  I ask the Minister to take those points on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I took this amendment seriously as I do all amendments.  My advice is that, as a matter of practice, the power to issue orders for service out of the jurisdiction exists.  If a difficulty arose the appropriate forum for amending the position is by rule of court through the Circuit Court rules.  No one would suggest that the right way to proceed would be by way of primary legislation.  As regards divorce proceedings raised by the Deputy, they would be outside the scope of this legislation.  I am assured at a practical level that there is no problem at Circuit Court level concerning this matter.</P>
      <P>If a problem does arise, it is possible to provide for it by amendment to the rules of the Circuit Court.  That is the best way to handle this. However, the problem does not arise as of now.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
      <P>Bill reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 (No. 29 of 1996), shall continue in operation for the period ending on the 31st day of December, 2000.</P>
      <P>The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuation in operation of those sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 which relate essentially to the detention provisions in that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Act provides that each of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months after the date of its commencement unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that it shall continue in operation.  The Act, including the sections which are the subject of the resolution, was brought into operation with effect from 9 September 1996.  The period of operation of the <Col N="1272" /> sections would therefore have expired on 8 September, 1997 unless appropriate resolutions were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before then.</P>
    <P>One of my first parliamentary duties on being appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June 1997 was to move a similar resolution in this House.  On that occasion the Act had been in operation for just under a year.  Recognising the relatively short period for which the sections had been in operation at that time, it was considered that their continuation should again be reviewable within 18 months.  It was decided therefore to continue them in operation until 31 December 1998.  This would allow the House an opportunity to debate the appropriateness of the sections in combating drug-related crime after a further suitable interval.  On this occasion it is proposed to continue them in operation for two years, that is until 31 December 2000.</P>
    <P>It is important that Members of this House should have the opportunity to re-examine legislative provisions such as these to determine the need to retain them as weapons in the Garda's armoury.  If at any stage it becomes clear that these provisions are no longer necessary, the mechanism is there for them to lapse.  I regret that time has not yet come and that we must continue to employ the detention provisions of the 1996 Act.  The effort to eliminate the menace which drugs pose to our society and to end their corrosive effects has involved a concerted effort on the part of the law enforcement agencies of the State in recent years.  Legislation such as the 1996 Act is only part of the answer.  Other aspects hinge on Garda operations.  In this regard I mention some recent initiatives, all of which have yielded positive results.</P>
    <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit was established in 1996 with the primary function of targeting major drug traffickers.  In the period January to September, 1988 Garda operations and joint operations involving the Garda and the customs authorities have yielded significant drug seizures with a value of £70 million.  In addition, there have been a number of significant seizures of heroin, amphetamines, cannabis and ecstasy in the Dublin region since September.</P>
    <P>Operation Dóchas, which began in October 1996, has as a primary objective the making of substantial inroads into the drug problem in the city through the identification of the critical areas requiring action and the development of the necessary Garda resources to implement the operation in these areas.  This strategy operates in all Dublin districts and involves the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plainclothes gardaí.  Uniformed gardaí adopt a high profile through foot patrols and mobile patrols, and are working with local communities, through community leaders and individual families.  Backup is provided by specialist mobile units and other units.  This operation has already resulted in an increase in the quantity of drugs seized and an increase in the arrests of those suspected of being <Col N="1273" /> involved in drugs.  Since the commencement of Operation Dóchas, up to June 1998, more than 21,000 arrests have been made and 10,060 persons have been charged.  In addition, drugs with a value of £7 million have been seized up to 30 September 1988.  To ensure its effectiveness Operation Dóchas is subject to ongoing review as are all Garda operations.  It will continue operating and will be revised as circumstances indicate or require.</P>
    <P>Operation Mainstreet was initiated in April 1997 with the purpose of targeting those persons engaging in the supply of controlled substances, particularly heroin, in city centre areas.  The operation has proved to be successful combining efforts from uniformed gardaí, the Divisional Drugs Unit and using the CCTV system.  This operation is ongoing and has resulted in more than 2,000 searches and more than 200 arrests, up to June 1998 and, in the period January to September 1988, seizures of £915,000 worth of controlled substances.</P>
    <P>Operation Cleanstreet which commenced in December 1997 targets on-street heroin dealers in the Dublin area.  Undercover gardaí visit areas where suspected drug dealing is taking place and when approached they buy drugs with marked money from the drug pusher.  When the undercover garda moves away, uniformed gardaí arrest the drug pusher for the purpose of a drug search and take the marked money and whatever other drugs he or she has from the pusher.  When the drug which was purchased has been analysed the pusher is arrested and charged.  Twelve undercover gardaí, two from each DMA Garda Division, are involved in this operation, co-ordinated by the Garda National Drugs Unit.  To date almost 200 arrests have been made, 101 of which have been made since 10 September 1998.</P>
    <P>These successes are to be applauded. However, while we must not become complacent and drop our guard in the fight against drug criminality, it is only right that we should keep our response under review.  In this context I emphasise that the Government accepts fully that as, well as tackling the supply side, comprehensive measures need to be taken also in relation to the demand side.  In this context I remind the House that a wide range of initiatives are under way in this regard, many of which arise in the context of the Government's strategy for dealing with social exclusion issues.</P>
    <P>To return specifically to the resolution before the House and to assist Deputies regarding the sections of the 1996 Act which are the subject of the resolution, it might be of benefit if I were to outline the contents of those sections.  Section 2 deals with powers of detention and permits the detention of a person suspected of having committed a drug trafficking offence for up to a maximum of seven days.  The first 48 hours of this period may be authorised by a member of the Garda Síochána of specified rank.  Thereafter, authority to detain the person up to the maximum of 7 days must be obtained from a judge of the <Col N="1274" /> Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court.  In each case the authorisation may be granted where the court is satisfied the detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Section 3 involves an amendment of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990 to allow for the taking of bodily samples in the case of a person detained under the Act.  Section 4 permits the rearrest of a person previously detained under section 2 who has been released without being charged.  The rearrest may be made only on the authority of a judge and only in cases where new information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release. Section 5 applies certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 to persons detained under section 2 of the Act, so that, for example, when there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting a detained person of having committed an offence he or she must be released.  It also covers such matters as the provision of medical attention, access to a solicitor and the destruction of records where a detained person is not prosecuted or where he or she is acquitted.</P>
    <P>Under section 6 the Minister may make regulations providing for the attendance of an officer of customs and excise at, and the participation of such an officer in, the questioning of persons detained under the provisions of the Act.  The position regarding such regulations is that work is proceeding on the preparation of regulations under the section which will be the subject of consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Garda Authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 11 also requires the Minister to prepare a report on the operation of the sections covering the period since the previous resolution.  This report is required to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas before a resolution is passed by either House and must cover the period from the date of the ending of the previous report up to a date not more than 21 days before the moving of the resolution.  Such a report has already been prepared covering the period from 28 June 1997 to 30 November 1998 and was laid before both Houses last week.</P>
    <P>The report, based on information received from the Garda Authorities, shows that the number of persons detained under section 2 during the period in question, that is, between 28 June 1997 and 30 November 1998, was 708.  Of these, 281 persons were detained for a period not exceeding six hours, which is the initial period of detention permitted under section 2; 272 for a period between six hours and 24 hours; 132 for a period between 24 hours and 48 hours; 13 for a period between 48 hours and 120 hours and 10 for a period between 120 hours and 168 hours. The number of persons detained under section 2 who were released without charge was 301.  A total of 407 persons were charged following detention under section 2, of whom 105 were convicted. <Col N="1275" /> There are 301 cases still pending before the courts and one case was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have indicated that the provisions of the legislation have proved beneficial to the force in the investigation of drug trafficking offences.  I have no doubt but that they have played their part in the fight against drug trafficking and that their continued operation is essential to the future success of that fight.  I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I support the extension of the detention provisions of the Criminal Justice (Drugs Trafficking) Act, 1996.  This legislation was introduced by Deputy Owen as Minister for Justice.  The Criminal Assets Bureau was established in tandem with it, as were the introduction of powers of seizure of assets.  These have proven to be the most potent instruments in tackling the drugs problem head on.</P>
      <P>The details of the procedures are clear, specific and adequate &mdash; six hours initial detention, followed by 18 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours and a further final 48 hours, a total of seven days, with the authorisation of a superintendent, a chief superintendent or the District or Circuit Courts. This time last year we were in the middle of a furore when there was considerable misinterpretation of the provisions of the legislation, on the part of the Garda and judges.  I do not know how this arose as the provisions are clear.  I am glad these glitches have been ironed out.  The legislation is now working effectively and its detail and provisions seem to be understood by all sides.</P>
      <P>As a result of Deputy Owen's drugs trafficking legislation and the initiative of Deputy Quinn in establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau and the attendant legislation on the seizure of assets, the major drugs barons are on the run.  Their empires are in tatters and are being dismantled.  They are coming before the courts, or are in jail or exile.</P>
      <P>I welcome a number of the initiatives announced by the Minister.  We acknowledge success when there is success.  However, the Minister and his colleagues have failed to deal with the crucial areas of drug use and drug pushing.  All the indications are, irrespective of how we trot out impressive figures, that the drug problem is of crisis proportions.  Independent studies have shown that 40 per cent of Irish 15 or 16 year olds admit to having used cannabis &mdash; a level unrivalled anywhere in Europe, even in Holland. There, where there is no prosecution for soft drug usage and where cannabis can be bought openly, only 14 per cent of school children experiment with drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lisbon based EU drugs monitoring agency has confirmed that Ireland is one of only a handful of European countries where drug abuse among school children is rampant and on the increase.  The number of addicts under 25 years old undergoing treatment is more than double the EU average.  The number of drug-related deaths has increased sixfold in Ireland in the past decade. <Col N="1276" /> Ireland also has the youngest group of drug addicts seeking treatment.  Two in three of those being treated for addiction are under 25 years old, compared with an EU average of approximately 29 years old.</P>
    <P>The report confirms the prevalence of heroin among young adult users.  Heroin is the main drug of three quarters of those seeking treatment. While we laud ourselves for high profile, spectacular, multi-million pound drugs seizures &mdash; I pay special tribute, as the Minister did, to the Garda national drugs unit and Customs officers &mdash; the reality is that what is being seized is only the tip of the iceberg.  Drug prices are reasonably stable and drugs are readily available.  Supplies are getting through to the domestic market and also for transit to Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland is in the unfortunate position of being a drugs entrepot. We have been identified as such because of our vast open coastline and our poor security.  What is seized is important.  I acknowledge, in terms of the gross figure given by the Minister, that on the surface it is an impressive multi-million pound seizure.  However, it represents only a fraction of the amount which passes through our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We have also failed miserably in tackling the socio-economic factors which have contributed to the pervasive drugs culture which sadly dominates huge tracts of urban Dublin and parts of Cork and Limerick.  It is also becoming a growing reality in other cities, towns and villages.  The real story in Ireland now is that if one wants drugs, they are obtainable in any part of Ireland, either urban or rural.</P>
    <P>We have failed to put education programmes in place.  The constantly decreasing age threshold points clearly to the need to introduce proper programmes for sixth class in primary schools. These programmes need to be continued throughout the post-primary sector.  We have failed in terms of our inability to stop children dropping out of school.  We have failed to target drugs blackspots with meaningful job opportunities. We have failed to lift people's horizons or to enable them to exploit and explore their talents and abilities in a meaningful way.  We have failed in terms of housing policy.  We have built huge ghettos where there are no jobs, no facilities, no green areas and no hope.</P>
    <P>The main target group must be children and education is the key.  Irrespective of how much resources are needed, they must be made available to try to protect the vulnerable.  We need to ensure that no matter how low a pupil-teacher ratio is required to penetrate this areas with education, the resources will be applied.  We need to ensure that every child who enters primary school will exit with some qualification.</P>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium is impressive in its commitment.  It recognises that drugs is one of the root causes of crime in our society.  It promises an integrated philosophy of prevention, education, detoxification and rehabilitation, ultimately leading to employment <Col N="1277" /> and reintegration into normal society.  It is worth looking at those headings.  Prevention &mdash; what has happened in terms of meaningful prevention on a national scale?  Education &mdash; what education programmes are in place to alert every child in every school to the reality of drugs?  Drugs are now available in every town, village and townland in the country.  Detoxification &mdash; the Minister knows Mountjoy is literally infested with drugs. People come out as they go in.  Rehabilitation is not even worthy of mention as there is none in our prison system.</P>
    <P>The programme sounds good &mdash; it is acknowledged that two thirds of all crime in Dublin is committed by drug addicts.  However, in terms of meeting the commitments given in the programme on a multi-faceted basis, it has been a hit and miss affair.  The 1996 Garda report speaks for itself.  For example, one heroin addict was responsible for 147 crimes.  Sixty six per cent of crimes committed in Dublin &mdash; mainly minor crimes have been committed by heroin addicts.  According to the last figure published by the Garda there are 4,105 heroin addicts in Dublin and 2,800 of those are acknowledged as having been involved in burglary and crime to feed their habit.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge initiatives such as the Minister has introduced &mdash; Operation Mainstream and Operation Clean Stream.  Deputy Owen as Minister introduced operation Dóchas.  We have a hang-up about pilot projects and we go from one to another.  We need a comprehensive programme, an all out war on drugs, as it has the most corrosive effect on society.</P>
    <P>Summerhill in inner city Dublin is a very good example.  Deputy Gregory is far more qualified than I to speak on this.  The people there have taken the bull by the horns and have dealt with the problem themselves.  They have co-operated with the Garda and have proved what can be achieved through a co-operative effort involving the community leading the battle and the Garda. If it can be done with inspiration, encouragement and resources in Summerhill, it can be done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measure.  Detention is crucially important in dealing with the problem.  However, I think we are coming at it, not from the wrong end of the market as it is necessary to fight fire with fire, but we need much more resources at the other end of the market in terms of imaginative initiatives to deal with the root causes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be opposing the motion, even if I am uncomfortable with the fact that it is still necessary to have this type of legislation on the Statute Book.  The drugs problem seems to be getting worse despite an Exchequer surplus and the fact that the Irish economy is the envy of our EU counterparts.  I do not believe measures such as this can stop drugs from getting onto the streets or tearing families and communities to shreds.  The drugs problem needs a multi-pronged approach which looks at individual users, the <Col N="1278" /> communities most affected by drugs and the legal system which deals with drug pushers and barons.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is inexorably linked to areas of disadvantage.  In Dublin alone there are 13,000 addicts, most of whom are addicted to heroin and live in the poorest areas of the city.  In my constituency there are huge problems in certain areas, particularly in parts of Dolphins Barn and Inchicore.  Unless there is a very targeted investment in these areas to stamp out drugs, trafficking will continue while a market exists.  Some of the flat complexes in these areas are not under constant surveillance.  The letting policy is far from perfect and to some extent allows drug barons to flourish.  To be fair to Dublin Corporation it has considerably &mdash; many might say radically &mdash; improved the management of these areas, but there is still scope for improvement.</P>
      <P>During last summer people living in and adjacent to Fatima Mansions were subjected to several nights of shooting during which old people living on their own and young families lived in fear.  As I understand it, some of these shoot outs, or demonstrations of fire power, were the result of turf wars between certain drug pushers and drug gangs.  If this activity occurred in an affluent housing estate it would have become an issue and radical action would have been taken to resolve the problem.  However, because it happened where it did, the story hardly got a line in the media, never mind priority attention.</P>
      <P>We must start treating areas of disadvantage as a priority.  It is not acceptable to ignore any longer the devastation drugs are causing to communities and families living there.  In an ideal society if resources were evenly spread, Ireland's drug crisis would not have reached its current level.  With an unprecedented amount of money in the Exchequer it is high time we started to address the causes of addiction, namely, bad housing, poor educational facilities, people dropping out of the education system, inadequate recreational resources and inadequate and pitiable employment opportunities.  Addressing these issues should be part of a package to prevent people from taking up drugs in the first place.  If that level of deprivation was removed the problem would not arise in the first place, or if it did, it would be very easy to contain and manage.</P>
      <P>We must make key changes to ensure those who have entered the world of drug addiction can abandon their habit and break the cycle of moving in and out of prison without rehabilitation. Day in day out our courts are full of drug addicts who have committed offences, including possession of drugs.  Our current system of handing down prison sentences to drug addicts is not working.  The drugs court system, if properly resourced, could have much more progressive outcomes, with addicts moving away from their habit and sustaining a livelihood through paid employment.  For this reason I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he intends pursuing this route, but unfortunately I still await progress on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> As it stands, addicts are being sentenced and most do not receive treatment while in prison. Once released their habit continues and most end up in prison again and again.  Furthermore, there is an urgent need to put in place court supervised treatment programmes for addicts who end up in prison.  There is an urgent need for the introduction of methadone maintenance programmes in all our major prisons where drug abuse is widespread among inmates.  The drug crisis in prisons is getting worse by the day.  People on methadone maintenance in the community are arriving in prison and, due to lack of access to maintenance programmes, are returning to the use of hard drugs.  People in prison should be entitled to the same opportunities of management, treatment and curbing of their addiction as in their community. It is a disgrace and a crime that prison inmates have almost unlimited access to illicit drugs and at the same time have no access to a sustained methadone programme.</P>
    <P>The majority of inmates in Mountjoy are drug addicts.  In most cases the crimes they have committed are drug related.  By locking up drug addicts in an institution which offers no solution to their fundamental problem of drug addiction, we are failing to address the root cause of the problem.  People are leaving Mountjoy in a more drug dependent state than when they arrive.  This means many are back on the street once outside, using every possible means to support their habit. Before long they end up in prison again.  A comprehensive methadone maintenance programme available to all prison inmates would help to significantly reduce the number leaving prison acutely dependent on drugs.</P>
    <P>In my area the Garda has demonstrated a capacity to deal with the problem.  In some areas there has been a huge reduction in the sale and use of drugs because of concerted efforts by the Garda.  This is particularly true of Fatima Mansions in the recent past.  The Garda has clearly demonstrated that if it has the resources and manpower it has the capacity to bring about a significant change.  This is openly acknowledged by the communities living in the area.</P>
    <P>Some of the seizures by the Garda in the past 12 months have been very significant if not spectacular. They are very alarming as they give an indication of the quantity of drugs available. Many communities are grateful to the Garda for the efforts and progress it has made.</P>
    <P>Those of us who go to public meetings on drugs know that Garda spokespersons do not tire of saying that Garda activity will not solve the drug problem.  Good progress is made when the Garda makes a seizure or an arrest, but the addiction remains and this must be tackled as it is fundamental. The problem we are facing is truly enormous. I wish this type of legislation was not necessary and that it was not necessary to renew it.  Unfortunately, it is necessary and for that reason I support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no real difficulty supporting the motion, although I think it is noteworthy that of the 708 persons detained, only ten had to be detained for a period anyway close to the full seven days.  I am not terribly sure what this indicates, but it seems to suggest that section of the legislation was not as necessary as some of us thought.  I supported it when the legislation was passing through the House.  I understood the reason for the annual reviews was to see how necessary the provision was.  I am not happy with the analysis of the experience over the past 12 months in that respect.  Because of the seriousness of it, I support the motion.</P>
      <P>I also agree with the Minister and other speakers in their recognition of the successes of the Garda, particularly the Garda National Drugs Unit, in recent months.  It is welcome to see such huge amounts of heroin being seized, one of which was valued somewhere in the region of £20 million and was found in two cars on a car ferry coming from Liverpool.  It is heartening to see that type of seizure being made and the people responsible being caught.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the other side to that is that for years &mdash; certainly in response to all the questions I tabled in this House &mdash; it was always put to me that if seizures were small, then that was evidence the problem was under control.  While I do not have a question or reply from which to quote, I assure the House that was the constant reply I received when I tried to draw attention to what I saw as a growing problem.  If that is the case and small seizures indicate the problem is under control, then the logic of that argument is that seizures of £20 million indicate the problem is out of control.  It certainly indicates the potential threat heroin and the people who deal in it pose mainly to Dublin but to other parts of the country as well.  In spite of these seizures and perhaps even because of them, there is clearly no place for complacency.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Upton in that the measures which will deal with the heroin problem are not police or law and order measures but are measures which will tackle social disadvantage which is the gateway to heroin.  The single most disappointing aspect of my attempt to represent my community and constituency in the Dáil has been my inability to convince the Minister for Education and Science that national schools in heroin task force areas should be treated differently from national schools in other areas.</P>
      <P>It is particularly disappointing that at a time when a drugs awareness programme is being introduced in schools throughout heroin task force areas, teachers are being taken out of those schools.  In the north inner city heroin task force area, I tried to draw attention to the fact that ten national schools lost teachers simply because they are treated on a national criteria of disadvantage or need.  They are not treated on the basis of the special needs these areas have in terms of a major heroin problem and appalling levels of social disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> It is probably noteworthy that it was the previous Government which designated the heroin task force areas in the first place and which made the case very strongly that these areas needed special attention.  The present Government says, superficially at least, that it supports that policy but, in practice, that is not the case.  In the critical vital area of education, it is definitely not the case.  If I was asked what I would do to try to deal with the heroin crisis in Dublin and where I would put resources, I say without even thinking, that I would put the resources into schools, preschools and national schools, in particular, specifically in the heroin task force areas.  It is a matter of extreme regret to me that despite making that case at committee, in the media and privately and publicly with the Minister, I appear to be getting nowhere.  This House will get nowhere with the heroin problem if it does not tackle it in that respect.</P>
    <P>Two years ago a commitment was made to end waiting lists for treatment, but they continue to grow.  We are at a stage where people who are addicted will not go for treatment because if they do so, they will be told there is a waiting list and that it is a waste of time.  There is virtually no rehabilitation after care programmes available to people who are on methadone treatment despite the fact it is accepted practice that it is an essential mechanism in getting people who are in treatment back into the community over a period of time and off drugs on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>The only initiatives in relation to rehabilitation and after care of which I am aware, were initiated by the community to which some Deputies referred.  The community in the north inner city initiated some pilot programmes which have proved to be extremely successful but only a handful of addicted people are able to attend.  The resources are clearly not going where they are needed.</P>
    <P>Recent research has shown that people addicted to heroin are more or less equally divided between young men and women.  Young women who have young children are least likely to seek treatment and only do so at a very late stage when, in many cases, they are beyond help. The reason is that there are no facilities for mothers to get treatment.  These issues must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The situation in prisons was referred to. Recently, I raised the fact that when prisoners who are on methadone maintenance in prison it is sort of a reverse situation &mdash; come out, they cannot get treatment in treatment centres for whatever bureaucratic reasons.  They come out of prison and go for methadone but are refused it because they are not on the list in the particular centre.  They go back on the streets buying heroin from drug dealers.  That is the cycle of which the health board, the prisons, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are aware.  They all say they are trying to do something about it. It is easy to organise it, but it is not being done. <Col N="1282" /> I do not know why it is not being done and perhaps the Minister will tell us.</P>
    <P>I raise an issue which I have raised on many occasions and in so doing, I pay tribute to the communities who, like the Garda and others, had a huge part to play in stemming some of the tide of the heroin upsurge in recent years.  Just as effectively as the Criminal Assets Bureau, they drove the heroin dealers out of this country. Those major drug dealers are based in Amsterdam. One of them who I named in this House I will not do so on this occasion as he is a well known individual and one of the leading heroin dealers supplying this country &mdash; is based in Amsterdam and continues his trade.  Others are based in Manchester, Liverpool and London. While there has been co-operation between the Garda and European police forces, particularly the police in Britain, with some recent successes, the main heroin dealers are still based in places like Amsterdam and are living lives of luxury on the misery of the many victims they have left behind.  I hope the Minister, through his European contacts, will seek to redress that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  It is important that measures such as those contained in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, be kept under review and that Members should periodically have the opportunity to receive a report on the effectiveness of the provisions and express their opinions on them.  Having listened to the views expressed, it is clear that Deputies also feel it is important there should be a debate on these issues at suitable intervals.  There are a number of legislative provisions on the Statute Book which have as their objective the elimination of the menace of drug trafficking.  Some of these are aimed specifically at tackling supply, but demand must also be targeted with a view to its reduction. This involves an integrated approach and this has been adopted by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is sometimes forgotten that the Government has provided £30 million under the EU facilities fund.  That is the Government putting its money where its mouth is.  It has endeavoured, through the Minister of State with responsibility for this area, Deputy Flood, to tackle the problem head on and has been unafraid to do so.  It is a difficult problem and complex to resolve but no one can doubt that the Minister of State is trying hard. The success of Garda operations, for which I am specifically responsible, such as Operations Dóchas, Main Street and Clean Street, as well as recent successes of joint action between the Garda and the customs service in making significant drugs seizures is evidence of a determined effort to eliminate the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution to the problem does not lie in any one area.  There is a need for an integrated and multi-faceted approach and legislation is only one element of that.  The success of the 1996 Act can be gauged from the report on its operation <Col N="1283" /> between the 28 June 1997 and 30 November 1998, which has already been laid before the House. While it may be academic, it is a fact that the 1996 Act is a close replica of legislation I introduced to the House on behalf of Fianna Fáil in Opposition. The report shows that, during the period in question, 105 people were convicted in the courts and a further 301 cases are pending.  From the information contained in the report based on material provided by the Garda, it is clear that sections of the Act have been used successfully in securing convictions against people trafficking in drugs. Regrettable though such measures may be, they are necessary if we are serious about ridding ourselves of the destructive potential posed by drug traffickers.  If and when the threat they pose is eliminated, the provisions of the 1996 Act will no longer be necessary and the mechanism exists for these sections to expire.  Deputies must be pleased with the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I also introduced to the House from the Opposition benches and which was accepted by the Government, however grudgingly.  That Act has been spectacularly successful in terms of freezing illicit assets.</P>
    <P>Specific reference was made to the issue of drugs in prison and it cannot be denied that it is a problem.  Treatment for drug addicted prisoners is currently available in all prisons as part of the general medical service available to all inmates. Any offender willing to make an effort to stop abusing drugs and who shows the necessary commitment and motivation is supported by appropriate medical intervention and therapeutic counselling. Unfortunately, many offenders refuse to grasp the opportunities provided to address their addiction.  During 1997, following medical assessment, approximately 1,650 inmates in Mountjoy Prison received the standard 14 day drug detoxification programme in the prison.  That is not indicative of the Government ignoring the problem in the prisons; it is the opposite.  The programme is operated by the medical personnel in the prison and is aimed at weaning addicts off drugs by means of gradually reducing dosages of substitutes, such as methadone.</P>
    <P>More intensive treatment is available at the drug treatment unit which has been in operation in Mountjoy Prison health care unit since July 1996.  That unit is modelled on similar hospital-based units in the community.  More than 156 inmates have been admitted to the drugs treatment unit since it opened.  A number of options are available for inmates who have completed the detoxification programme in the drug treatment unit.  They can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population, they can, if considered suitable, be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency, or they may transfer to the drug free unit at the training unit adjacent to Mountjoy Prison.  This unit provides a sympathetic yet closely monitored setting in which prisoners coming to terms with their addiction and who have stable drug-free <Col N="1284" /> status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs.  The regime in the drug free unit also provides inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of work and training related activities to assist in the rehabilitation process.</P>
    <P>The drug treatment unit has proved to be a success. The successful completion rate of the programme during the first 12 months of operation was 98 per cent.  Of the 88 patients accepted to the programme in the first year, 36 had returned to drug use at the time of the review.  A review of the first two years of operation has proved that prisoners who are motivated and given an opportunity to engage in a structured detoxification and rehabilitation programme and whose environment is made drug free through strict regulation of visits will successfully stay off illicit drugs.  In addition, there are weekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings in the unit.  Individual counselling is also available on request from the probation service and voluntary organisations such as Anna Liffey, Coolmine Therapeutic Community and the Merchant's Quay Project, which visit the prison regularly.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to curtail the smuggling in and use of illegal drugs in prisons.  These include video surveillance, improved visiting and searching facilities, increased vigilance by staff and urine testing.  It is intended to continue efforts to reduce the level of drug abuse in the prison system and to have a medical treatment programme and a secure drug free unit in every closed institution as soon as possible and where necessary. To this end, the Department has agreed a policy on substance abuse with the Eastern Health Board.  A plan is being drawn up to implement the policy.  In addition to examining the feasibility of providing a drug free area in each prison and increased detoxification facilities, it is intended to consider the development of further education and training courses suitable for addicts which could be devised in conjunction with an aftercare programme.</P>
    <P>Progress in developing the drug treatment programme and drug free areas is greatly hampered by the old problem of overcrowding in committal prisons.  This obstacle will be removed as the prison building programme progresses.  The opening of the new women's prison at Mountjoy, a new male remand centre at Plover Hill and a new male prison in Portlaoise in 1999 will help alleviate the problem.  Deputy Gregory said that only ten people were held for a period of between 120 and 160 hours for questioning may indicate the legislation was not as necessary as some people thought.  I disagree.  That number would appear to be relatively low in terms of the overall number of detentions but there are a limited number of cases where such detention is required.  Unfortunately one could point to instances in the past where a successful conviction might have been obtained if the period of detention had been <Col N="1285" /> longer.  Some 132 people were detained for a period of between 24 and 48 hours.</P>
    <P>Prior to this legislation it was not possible to do that because the Criminal Justice Act did not allow it.  Only in a case where firearms explosives were used, pursuant to the Offences Against the State Act, could a person be held for a period of 48 hours.  The legislation is not only desirable but necessary and it has been effective.  From my perspective and that of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the struggle against drug use will continue unabated.  Where legislative provisions are deemed necessary they will be provided.  Resources are provided to the Garda Síochána and every effort I can make to tackle the terrible scourge in society will continue to be made.  It must be recognised that legislation and law enforcement is only one aspect of the armour required in the struggle against drugs.  I have never thought otherwise.</P>
    <P>The need for an integrated and multi-faceted approach is recognised by the Government.  In this respect not only has the Government been quick to move in the legislative area and in the law enforcement area as evidenced, it has also been quick to move in the other areas and is committed to battling this problem to the end.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  In regard to adoption procedures I welcome the Minister's recent initiative to establish a committee of experts to look at the differences of approach to the assessment procedures by all health boards, with a view to standardising them.  While I subscribe to the view that nothing short of a full and rigorous assessment of applicants is acceptable in this area, for the most part this is a difficult but vital role which professional social workers must fulfil.  I am concerned at the apparent varying practices of the health boards.  I hope this team will find a way of assisting the introduction of the best assessment procedures possible.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party fully supports strict compliance with the Hague Convention on intercountry adoptions which should exclude non-convention adoptions and the privatisation of adoption services.  Adoption is a service for children and as such it must not be privatised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In raising the matter of access to birth records I recognise the history surrounding the treatment of fostered, adopted and institutionalised children which continues into their adult lives.  Decisions affecting their childhood are made on their behalf and continue to be made long after they cease to be children.  It is a case of the &ldquo;does he take sugar&rdquo; syndrome where decisions are made for people without asking them what they want.  It is <Col N="1286" /> symptomatic that the person with responsibility for studying post-adoption services legislation is the Minister of State with special responsibility for children.  I am talking about the treatment of adopted people over the age of 18 years, their natural mothers and their adoptive families, whenever these adults seek information from State records concerning their origins and family relationships.  We need to put a system in place which works for everyone involved.  When adopted people seek this information why can they not receive it in a direct way?  A better way can surely be found to deal with post-adoption issues which recognises that adopted and fostered children and children raised in institutions have, as adults, the same rights as all other autonomous and responsible individuals in their dealings with the State.  I understand legislation on this issue is being drafted by the child care unit in the Department of Health and Children.  This is following through on a commitment given in the Health Strategy by my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in his capacity as Minister for Health.  A lengthy supreme court case prevented the introduction of this legislation until recently.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for making the introduction of this vital legislation a priority in his Department.  I understand the officials charged with the responsibility of drafting this legislation are extremely diligent and are making good progress in their preparation.  For some, this legislation cannot come quickly enough.</P>
    <P>In recent months I have met and corresponded with various voluntary groups representing all the parties to adoption.  With regard to the legislation concerning access to birth records for adopted people, it is necessary for the Minister and his officials to bear in mind when drafting the legislation that the rights of the child must come first. We need a post-adoption service board which would safeguard the right to privacy of those few people, whether natural parents, adopted persons, adopting people or others who have no wish to make contact.  The needs of those affected by adoption and fostering go well beyond the contact register.  The new board will be responsible for maintaining a central register of all adoption, fostering and child institution files, including copies of all adoption agency files.  It would provide practical non-judgmental advice on all relevant matters and ensure counselling is available to those who need it.  In no way should counselling be a pre-condition to obtaining information.  The board would also involve itself in ongoing research.  It is essential that adequate funding and personnel resources should be provided.  These proposals are modest and deserve consideration.</P>
    <P>People who have been affected by adoption should be treated properly in accordance with their basic human rights.  At present we are saying to more than 40,000 adopted people in Ireland that because they are so special they are excluded from the provisions of the Ombudsman Act, the Status of Children Act, the Data Protection Act <Col N="1287" /> and the Freedom of Information Act.  It is a sad and sorry state of affairs that our Constitution which pledges to treat all children equally has failed so miserably when the facts show that such a large number of people can be systematically discriminated against on the sole basis of being adopted.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Government should live up to its responsibilities as a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which states that a child should be registered immediately after birth, should have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.  The issue is not as complex as some may suggest.  It has been resolved successfully in many other jurisdictions.  The people affected are in a legal quagmire.  They can attempt to conduct their own research, sometimes with the help of paid private detective agencies but at best this is a hit and miss affair.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that the restrictions in the current legislation will continue to cause unnecessary suffering.  I call on the Minister to ensure that people's right to know who they are, which is a fundamental human right, will be reflected in the forthcoming legislation.  That legislation should be introduced as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan is aware, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case earlier this year which addressed a number of constitutional and legal matters surrounding post-adoption contact. Specific staff in the newly established child care legislation unit of the Department of Health and Children have been assigned to the preparation of legislation in this area.  These staff have been familiarising themselves with the issues involved in this complex area and have met with the Office of the Attorney General in the matter.  The advice of the Office of the Attorney General is being awaited and once it is received and examined, the child care legislation unit will be in a position to enter into an extensive consultation process with all parties as early as possible in 1999.  The aim of the consultation process, which will follow the format of the recently concluded consultation process on the ratification of the Hague Convention is to facilitate an inclusive and well informed approach to the preparation of legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the interest groups who recently met with the representatives of the child care legislation unit in the Department of Health and Children during the consultation process on the ratification of the Hague Convention will also be involved in the consultation process on post-adoption contact.  These interest groups are aware <Col N="1288" /> of the approach being taken in this area and of the priority which the Department of Health and Children attaches to the overall introduction of legislation on adoption and associated issues.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will listen carefully to all views before finalising his proposals so that this issue can be dealt with in a coherent, integrated and sensitive manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter for discussion and I thank the Minister for coming before the House to take it.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the inadequate man-power and resources available to the Garda authorities in south Galway, with specific reference to the towns of Gort, Athenry and Kinvara.  Events in south Galway last weekend have precipitated widespread concern in the community.  A member of the Garda Síochána was attacked and seriously assaulted when rival gangs of outsiders caused a serious disturbance in the town.  The garda was struck with an iron bar and received serious injuries when he tried to break up a disturbance.</P>
      <P>On the night in question, only two gardaí were on duty, a totally inadequate number to serve the town and district.  There is no substitute for an active Garda presence in an area.  The presence of and access to Garda assistance provides an important sense of protection to the population in any area, but particularly to elderly people living in rural districts.  The provision of a one-man car protection system from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. is totally inadequate and can be dangerous, not only for the garda involved but also for the community at large.</P>
      <P>Gort is a district Garda headquarters and, if these are the only resources available, I call on the Minister to urgently review the needs of the area in terms of increasing Garda numbers and resources.  In Athenry, which has a population of over 2,000 people, there is no Garda presence from 10 p.m. until early morning.  All that is provided is a call out system in the form of a &ldquo;green man&rdquo; alert button on the door of the Garda barracks. It takes gardaí from Galway city, who cover the area at night, a minimum of 45 minutes to respond to a call.  Must the communities in these areas live in fear despite the Government's policy of zero tolerance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate what he intends to do to improve this intolerable situation?  What plans does he have to deploy additional gardaí in order that members of the public can rest assured that they can go about their business in safety?  Will the Minister provide a 24 hour service in Athenry?  High visibility uniformed gardaí on patrol and good community relations could resolve the problems in these areas.  The people of south Galway deserve from the State the minimum protection afforded by a good Garda presence. Were it not for the existence of the neighbourhood <Col N="1289" /> watch system in the area, what could the community there expect by way of Garda protection?</P>
    <P>There is public disquiet in many areas of south Galway regarding the absence of a Garda presence. Only 58 per cent of gardaí are deployed on regular uniform duties such as walking a beat, going on mobile patrols and carrying out station duties.  Surely responsibility for a number of the non-operational duties currently undertaken by gardaí could be given to other bodies and individuals in order to release additional gardaí for patrolling duties.</P>
    <P>If the Minister fails to provide adequate Garda services and resources in the area in question, the least he should do is resurrect the old system whereby roadblocks were put in place to stop mobile gangs entering areas and terrorising rural communities.  It is unfortunate that these gangs are now visiting towns and causing the kind of disturbance which led to a garda being seriously injured last weekend.  Will the Minister review this matter urgently and make every possible resource available to the Garda in the area to which I refer in order to ensure that there will not be a recurrence of this problem?  The area is inhabited by peaceable people and disturbances of this kind have never occurred there before.  I hope the Minister will respond positively in terms of dealing with this emerging problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Burke for his contribution on this important issue.  It is not unusual for areas to seek increased Garda man-power and resources in view of their effectiveness in tackling crime and providing a deterrent against would-be criminals.  This is perfectly understandable and is a reflection of the importance people attach to the visible presence of the Garda.  We must, however, readily admit that resources are finite and it is, therefore, incumbent on us to make the best use of the resources at our disposal.  Among the factors we need to take into account are the level of crime, the population and geography of an area.  Moving additional Garda resources into one area means that other areas are deprived of those resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas.  They have advised me that in the past year there has only been one incident in the Gort Garda district that could be described as quite serious.  This occurred on Saturday last, 12 December 1998, at approximately 2.40 a.m., when an altercation between settled traveller family groups took place at the Square in the town of Gort.  The incident lasted approximately five minutes and no person outside the family groups was involved.  Three gardaí were on duty in the town and were present in the Square when the row erupted.  A number of persons have been arrested and several interviewed.  A file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions and it will then be a matter for the DPP, as an <Col N="1290" /> independent officer, to decide what charges should be brought.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with crime figures for the Galway West or Millstreet Garda district which includes Athenry and the Gort district &mdash; that includes Kinvara &mdash; for the period 1995 to 31 October 1998.  The figures for Millstreet are included as Athenry is contained in that district.</P>
    <P>The statistics relating to Millstreet show that a total of 2,180 offences were reported in 1995, with 876 of these being detected.  These included offences against the person, burglary, robbery, larceny, forgery and others.  A total of 2,011 offences were reported in 1996 with 873 detected; 1,381 in 1997 with 635 detected, and 1,131 to the end of October this year with 478 detected.  These statistics show clearly that the number of crimes in the Millstreet district is steadily decreasing. The percentage detection rate for the area has increased from 40 per cent in 1995 to 42 per cent in 1998.</P>
    <P>The statistics for Gort show a lower level of crime than in Millstreet.  A total of 69 offences were reported in 1995 with 17 detected.  These included offences against the person, burglary, robbery, larceny, forgery and others.  A total of 66 offences were reported in 1996 with 27 detected; 87 in 1997 with 48 detected, and 100 to the end of October this year with 40 detected. The percentage detection rate for Gort has increased from 25 per cent in 1995 to 40 per cent in 1998.</P>
    <P>The staffing strength of the Gort Garda district, including Kinvara, is 33.  The staffing strength of Athenry Garda station is three and the Galway West Garda district, including Athenry, is 162. The only reduction in staffing strength in the Gort, Kinvara and Athenry areas is in Athenry where a sergeant retired last month.  I understand from the Garda authorities that community alert schemes operate in each of these areas.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have advised me that they are satisfied that the current deployment of resources in the area is adequate in meeting present policing needs.  The situation, however, will be kept under review.  If the Deputy has a further point that he wishes to make or wishes me to consider, I will be happy to accept it.</P>
    <P>When I took office the number of gardaí was far lower.  At about 11,150, it is now at its highest level for a considerable period.  There is a campaign under way to recruit 550 gardaí next year. With the recruitment this year, this is the first back-to-back major recruitment drive for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>International experience indicates that only 10 per cent of asylum seekers will be found to be genuine refugees.  I greatly dislike the prejudicial view of applications for asylum in the Department.  It solidifies the need for an independent evaluation of applications.  The Minister appears to have set himself and his officials a target <Col N="1291" /> for the number of applicants who will be admitted.  Repeated media reports point to a pre-Christmas clear-out of unsuccessful applicants. Two applicants have been imprisoned in Mountjoy Prison and are awaiting deportation.  Is this the brutal manner in which the Minister will deport the remaining unsuccessful applicants?  If so, he will tarnish Ireland's image on the international stage and it could well lead to another shocking death such as the one in Belgium during one such deportation.</P>
      <P>Due to a poor response by the State, asylum applicants have been abandoned to a state of limbo without the right to work and integrate in society.  Despite these odds they have built a life for themselves.  The Minister proposes to destroy their lives.  Many children have been attending school for a number of years and will now be forced to leave their friends and schoolrooms.</P>
      <P>The Minister's problem is that these deportations lack legitimacy.  The provision of an independent refugee commissioner is the key to securing a fair and efficient consideration of an application for asylum.  It is regrettable that the Minister has decided to shelve the Refugee Act which he supported enthusiastically and vigorously in opposition.  If he believes he will solve the refugee problem by slipping mass deportations through on the quiet, he is wrong.  My party will oppose such deportations which lack legitimacy. They are brutal acts against some of the weakest members of society.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Minister has set himself a 10 per cent target which he intends to fulfil.  We cannot have confidence that his Department has considered applications fairly.  It can easily be concluded that his officials pay more attention to his target figure than the terms of the Geneva Convention. The Minister is trying to slip through deportations with dawn raids and imprisonment. He will fail in this task.</P>
      <P>There is a solution.  Those who fail to be given asylum status could be allowed to remain as legal immigrants.  This would allow them to reside, work and prosper in Ireland.  It would not mean an open door for immigration, rather it offers a solution to the immediate problem.  It is imperative that the status &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; remains sacrosanct under the Geneva Convention.  There should not be a blanket award of refugee status.  Asylum policy should not be confused with immigration policy. The Labour Party does not wish to see a dilution of the status of refugees.  The Minister must not continue his policy of deportation which lacks legitimacy.  There is a need for an independent refugee commissioner.  Those whom his Department decides are not genuine refugees should be awarded the status of legal immigrant. This is true of those who have been resident here for a prolonged period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I do not agree with much of what he said, I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to provide the clarification <Col N="1292" /> he seeks on the deportation of persons who have had their applications for asylum rejected.  I will outline briefly the measures I have put in place for processing asylum claims.</P>
      <P>When the Government took office in June 1997 there were 22 staff to deal with the thousands of cases which had built up over the previous two years.  A few months before there were four staff assigned to this work.  I was faced with a chaotic situation where nobody had given political leadership, let alone put in place administrative arrangements, and where applicants were left in the dark about whether their cases would be dealt with.  The legacy of the previous Government in this area could only be described as a complete and utter shambles.</P>
      <P>The Government has increased staffing in this area almost tenfold to close on 200.  We aim to deal with new arrivals as they come into the system and, if possible, to give decisions on their applications within six months.  We are making substantial inroads into the backlog of applications to such an extent that in a matter of weeks all applications lodged prior to 1997 will be at various stages of processing.  We have established a one-stop-shop customised premises which includes reception, social welfare and health facilities for asylum seekers as well as the processing of claims.</P>
      <P>The logical consequence of devoting so many resources to the processing of asylum claims at the projected cost of £8 million in 1999 is that persons who are not recognised as refugees after having been through the process must be asked to leave the State if there is no other basis for giving them permission to remain.  If this were not the case and persons were allowed to remain in Ireland irrespective of whether they achieved recognition as refugees, there would be no point in processing their claims in the first place.</P>
      <P>Many of the critics of my Department &mdash; not all of them in this House &mdash; are very ready to point to alleged shortcomings in the system of processing asylum claims but are very slow to acknowledge that persons who fail to achieve recognition as refugees must logically be asked to leave the State and be deported if necessary.  This is essential in order to maintain the integrity of the asylum process and is a view very strongly shared and indeed publicly expressed by none other than the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Representatives of the UNHCR have stated that our system could act as a model for other countries and, naturally, this is something which pleases me greatly.  They also, in the course of a recent meeting I had with them, discussed the operation of the asylum procedures and were unstinting in their praise of the strides which have been made in recent times in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the operational arrangements for deportation, these are principally a matter for the Garda Síochána who are immigration officers. This includes such matters as treatment of persons in custody and the use of restraints and complaints <Col N="1293" /> against individual members.  With regard to the procedures that apply prior to the making of a deportation order, these have derived in the main from decisions taken by the courts.</P>
    <P>With reference to the case of a person who was due to be deported to Belgium in accordance with the provision of the Dublin Convention, my Department has been informed by this person's solicitor that the High Court has granted leave to apply for judicial review and has ordered a stay on the deportation order.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Garda are considering the question of instituting criminal charges in respect of alleged offences arising out of an incident which occurred during an attempt to enforce a deportation order earlier today at Dublin Air-port. In the circumstances I cannot comment in any further detail on this matter.</P>
    <P>The statement made by Deputy Upton that there is a quota on the number of refugees who are accepted into the country is most unworthy of him.  It is simply untrue.</P>

      <P>Tá Gairmscoil Chú Uladh suite i mBéal an Átha Mhór i nGaeltacht Lár Dhún na nGall.  Roimh 1982 ní raibh iar-bhunoideachas tré Ghaeilge le fáil ag páistí an cheantair seo cé gur i nGaeilge a bhí a gcuid bunscolaíochta.  Ba mhór an dochar é sin do labhairt agus stádas na Gaeilge san áit.</P>
      <P>Tháinig buíon daoine le chéile agus bhunaigh siad feachtas le hiar-bhunscoil Ghaelach a fháil. Sa bhliain 1982 ceadaíodh scoil, cuireadh seomraí réamhdhéanta ar fáil agus i bhfómhar na bliana d'oscail an scoil úr le 23 dalta ar na rollaí.</P>
      <P>Ba ar bhonn trialach a ceadaíodh an scoil ar feadh dhá bhliain.  In a dhiaidh sin cheadaigh an tAire Oideachais ag an am, Gemma Hussey, trí bliana eile agus i 1994 osclaíodh scoil úr i bhfoirg-neamh úr.</P>
      <P>Inniu tá tinreamh de 155 ar an scoil; gach ábhar á theagasc trí Ghaeilge agus saol na scoile uilig á riaradh trí Ghaeilge.  Scéal iontach dóchasach gan dabht.</P>
      <P>D'éirigh leis an scoil atá ainmnithe do Chú Uladh, duine de bhunaitheoirí Chonradh na Gaeilge, spiorad agus borradh úr a thabhairt isteach sa cheantar Gaeltachta seo.  Ní amháin go bhfuil oideachas d'ard-chaighdeán á chur ar fáil ach gla-cann siad páirt in imeachtaí eile mar dhíospóire-achtaí, spórt agus Taispeántas na nEolaithe Óga Aer Lingus.  Chomh maith le torthaí den scoth a bhaint amach sna scrúduithe tá gradaim agus duaiseanna go leor eile ag an scoil i gcomórtais áitiúla agus náisiúnta.</P>
      <P>Tá an chéadchodán de na daltaí a chríoch-naíonn cúrsa Ardteistiméarachta níos airde ná an meán ar fud na tíre agus an chéad-chodán a thite-ann amach as oideachas níos ísle ná an meán náisiúnta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin féin tá deacrachtaí sa scoil de bharr easpa áiseanna agus spáis.  Níl ach sé seomra ranga rialta sa scoil, rud a chiallaíonn go mbíonn <Col N="1294" /> ranganna ar siúl sa halla agus sa phasáiste go rialta.  Níl de spás sa seomra ríomhaireachta ach 36 méadar cearnach, rud a fhágann go mbíonn sé plódaithe.</P>
    <P>Tá na háiseanna leithris easnamhach.  Níl ach dhá leithreas do bhuachaillí agus trí leithreas do chailíní le freastal ar 150 dalta.</P>
    <P>Níl sé seo ceart nó inghlactha.  Níl áiseanna leithris ann do na múinteoirí agus níl oifig ann don phríomh oide.</P>
    <P>Níl leabharlann sa scoil agus níl seomra staidéir do na mic léinn sinsearacha a bhíonn ag ullmhú do scrúduithe.  Níl seomra bídh sa scoil do na daltaí agus tá an seomra fóirne ró-chúng agus bíonn sé plódaithe nuair a bhíonn na múinteoirí uilig i láthair.</P>
    <P>Cé go bhfuil páirc bhreá imeartha in aice leis an scoil níl folcadáin ann do na daltaí mar a bhíonn i scoileanna eile.  Mar sin, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil géarghá le breis áiseanna agus spáis má tá an scoil le forbairt agus freastal ceart a dhéanamh ar na daltaí.</P>
    <P>Is iad na háiseanna is práinní atá de dhith orthu anois ná seomra úr ríomhaireachta, trí sheomra ranga agus ceann acu gléasta go speisialta do líníocht theicniúil, tuilleadh leithris agus seomraí clóchaí, seomraí folca agus gléasta do chúrsaí spóirt, seomra ceart fóirne &mdash; d'fhéadfaí an seomra fóirne atá ann faoi láthair a úsáid mar oifig &mdash; agus seomra lóin nó proinnteach a d'fhéadfaí a úsáid mar sheomra staidéir nuair a bhíonn feidhm leis.</P>
    <P>Deineadh plé ar na háiseanna seo ag an Choiste Ghairmoideachais agus aontaíonn an coiste go bhfuil gá leis an obair seo a dhéanamh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Táim ag iarraidh ar an Aire agus ar an Roinn cead a thabhairt don Choiste Ghairmoideachais dul ar aghaidh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Gairmscoil Chú Uladh is situated in Ballinamore in the Donegal Gaeltacht Lár, one of the strongest Gaeltacht areas in County Donegal, if not in the country.  This school was established in 1982 in response to a campaign waged by local parents and others who wanted post-primary education through the medium of Irish for their children. At its opening day in 1982 there was an enrolment of 23 pupils accommodated in a number of prefabricated classrooms.</P>
    <P>Since then the school has developed and expanded.  In 1994 a new building was officially opened and today there are more than 150 pupils enrolled.  This school has obtained a high level of academic achievement, an above average percentage of the pupils complete their second level studies and the drop-out rate is much lower than the national average.  The pupils have also won recognition for activities other than academic subjects.  They participate with distinction in many types of sport, cultural events such as Scór na nÓg and have won many awards at the Aer Lingus Young Scientist of the Year Exhibition.</P>
    <P>They urgently need extra accommodation including a computer room, three general classrooms, enhanced toilet and cloakroom facilities, <Col N="1295" /> changing rooms and showers, an office, a canteen and a staffroom.  These plans have already been discussed at and are supported by County Donegal VEC of which I am a member and I understand stong representations have been made through the VEC to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that this application is sanctioned so that the pupils of Gairmscoil Chú Uladh have the accommodation to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date this year a record level of £804 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes.  This compares most favourably with the positions in 1997 and 1996 when £746 million and £788 million respectively were paid at the years' end.  The previous high level of payments in 1996 and 1997 resulted from a concession being obtained from the European Commission to overcome problems associated with the introduction of a new computerised land parcel identification system (LPIS).  While the EU concession facilitated large levels of payment in those two years, on the negative side its application resulted in the build up of significant processing backlogs which had detrimental impacts on the following years processing. This was a factor in dealing with 1998 area aid applications.  All payments are now made on the basis of a clear area aid declaration, major advances have been achieved in dealing with area aid applications in 1998.  In the past week alone over £19 million has been paid bringing the total paid out so far under the 1998 schemes to over £503 million.  The corresponding figure at this time last year was £479 million.  The payment targets under the Charter of Rights for Farmers for the main headage and premium schemes are very specific and in 1998 the payment commencement targets have been met or indeed surpassed under these schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> In so far as the 1998 headage schemes are concerned, payment of sheep headage commenced on 21 September, one week ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  To date over £20 million has been paid.  Payments under the 1998 cattle headage scheme commenced on 26 September three weeks ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  Payments under the 1998 beef cow schemes commenced on 30 October 1998.  To date £88 million has been paid to cattle headage-beef cow applicants.</P>
    <P>Of the 89,000 applications received under the 1998 cattle headage/beef cow scheme, some 2,700 applications have not been cleared for payment at local office level because of problems of one kind or another.  In these cases the applicants have been written to and my Department is awaiting responses.</P>
    <P>The second instalment of 1998 ewe premium was agreed at EU level on 2 October.  The regulation giving effect to the rate was published on 16 October and payments totalling £24.699 million were paid to 97 per cent of applicants during week ending 23 October 1998.</P>
    <P>Payments of the advances under the 1998 special beef premium started on 19 October 1998 as opposed to 1 November 1997 under the 1997 schemes.  I secured this earlier payment date this year with an 80 per cent advance instead of the normal 60 per cent advance in order to increase the cash flow to farmers in the October-December period.  So far over £85 million has been paid.  This compares with £53 million paid at this time last year.  Of the 169,000 January to September applications received, some 6,500 are under query and in these cases the farmers concerned have been written to on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>Payments under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 20 October 1998 which is ahead of the commencement date of 4 November 1997 under the 1997 scheme.  The earlier commencement and higher rate of advance applies also to this scheme.  To date over £102 million has been paid.  The position at this time last year was that £75 million was paid.  Of the 73,500 applications received under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme, over 2,600 are under query at local office level and in these cases the applicants have been written to on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1998 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October and, including payments in respect of oilseeds advances, some £90 million has now been paid to 98 per cent of applicants. Those applicants who have not yet been paid, have been written to setting out the reason for non-payment.</P>
    <P>I have also made arrangements for payments under the winter fodder scheme valued at over £10 million to issue this week with payments under the cull ewe supplementary measure to follow before the year's end.</P>
    <P>The position on area aid is that some 4,500 of the 1998 area aid applications are still under <Col N="1299" /> query.  Of these some 1,500 will receive payments or part payments by the end of the week leaving 3,000 cases which have particularly difficult overclaim problems most of them commonage related.  The area aid unit is currently concentrating all of its resources on the resolution of problems associated with these cases with a view to paying the farmers concerned at the earliest opportunity.  EU Regulations, require a 100 per cent check on all land parcels submitted by farmers on their area aid declarations.  This ensures that farmers are not overclaiming on individual parcels of land or that two or more farmers are not claiming on the same parcel.  Of the 132,000 area aid applications received in 1998, some 85,000 required changes to the 1997 data.  Many of these changes had to be redigitised on the LPIS database and in some cases this process results in the creation of dual or overlap claims against a previously clear contiguous farm.  This makes it necessary to establish actual entitlement to the area concerned which can be a difficult process.  Furthermore, I should point out that not all applications will ultimately be entitled to payment. For example over 1,000 May 1998 suckler cow applicants do not hold suckler cow quotas and are therefore not entitled to payment.  In other cases payments are withheld because of the application of penalties and in some cases farmers omitted to complete an area aid declaration.  As I have pointed out the applicants who have been written to have yet to establish entitlement under the relevant schemes.  It should be noted also that payments do not conclude at the end of the calendar year.  For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef premium scheme the regulations provide for advance payments in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year.  Payments to applicants under the October 1998 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1999.  The House will appreciate therefore that until such time as each application is finalised in conjunction with the farmer concerned it is simply not possible at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of the value of outstanding payments or the percentage of farmers still awaiting payment in any county.</P>
    <P>I am extremely conscious of the importance of headage and premia payments to farmers and their families.  With this in mind, I successfully approached the European Commission early in the autumn to secure earlier and larger advance payments under special beef and suckler cow schemes.

      <P>The prices which producers receive for their product are determined by many factors including in particular the balance between supply and demand.  For those products covered by the EU Common Agricultural Policy, the various supports applied within the market regime in question are, in general, designed to support producer prices at or above particular levels.  The manner in which the processing, distribution and marketing of the primary product is carried on, either in more basic or value added form, is also a major factor in the price available to the producer at farm level.</P>
      <P>One of the principal means at my disposal to ensure that a fair price is paid to producers is to negotiate adequate market support arrangements for the product in question at EU level.  The provision of EU and National Exchequer investment aid for projects related to the processing and marketing of food products is also a mechanism designed to ensure that there is sufficient competition within the trade and that the maximum value is added to the available raw material.  As regards marketing, the work done by An Bord Bia contributes towards the enhancement of the ultimate price paid to producers.  The various measures to guarantee the safety and quality of produce provide the necessary assurance to the consumer and protects the price to the producer.</P>

      <P>There are currently over 39,000 participants in REPS farming in excess of 1.32 million hectares of land and corresponding to approximately 29 per cent of Ireland's agricultural area.</P>
      <P>The revised REP scheme requires that a framework plan be drawn up for all commonage lands. The preparation of the framework plans will be carried out under the supervision of my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, as I announced recently, interim arrangements have been agreed between <Col N="1301" /> my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  The national plan involves a destocking of mountain ewes equivalent to 30 per cent of the quota held in 1998 for flock holders who use commonage in six counties, Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway and Kerry, that is those counties identified as having overgrazed commonages.  Plans prepared under the national framework plan will be reviewed when the individual commonage framework plans are available in 1999.</P>
    <P>The revised REP scheme provides that farmers with commonage land who are already in the scheme or who join the scheme in the future can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres on the basis of the national framework plan and the other conditions of the revised scheme.  It has been necessary to revise the scheme document and the agri-enviromnental specifications to take account of the new measure.  These, along with application forms, will be available from my Department's farm development services offices shortly opening the way to the implementation of the revised REPS.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, and I as Minister, have always acknowledged that the past few months have been difficult for many Irish farmers, and I have concentrated on taking practical steps towards alleviating those difficulties.</P>
      <P>The CSO's latest estimate for 1998, released last Friday, shows a decline in aggregate farm income of 5.6 per cent.  This result is disappointing, coming after last year's decline, and in view of the very good income performance in the previous five years.  The aggregate income figure masks different performances in different sectors. 1998 was a relatively good year for dairy farmers. On the other hand, cattle, sheep and pig farmers were hit by substantial difficulties in the second half of the year.  The two primary causes were the unfavourable weather and the collapse of the Russian meat market, the extent and nature of which was not anticipated.  The measure announced in the recent budget, in the form of a new farm assist income support scheme, is designed to assist farmers with income difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1302" /> I have taken a wide range of measures to alleviate the serious problems faced by these sectors, and to provide additional income support for farm families.</P>
    <P>Total direct income payments this year will amount to over one billion pounds.  This record figure reflects speeding up of payments by my Department; an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent; and a special package of almost £20 million including £10 million in fodder payments, £6 million for mountain ewe de-stocking, and almost £3 million in sheep headage top-up.</P>
    <P>Other key actions which I have taken included winning substantial increases in export refunds for beef and pigmeat; getting private storage schemes for sheepmeat and pigmeat; and obtaining increased access to intervention for heavier cattle.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget contains several measures which will help to support farm families over the next year.</P>
    <P>The new farm assist scheme will have a changed basis for assessing eligibility for payment. As a result, many farm families who do not currently qualify for assistance will now qualify; and many families who already qualify will be eligible for higher rates of payment.  The number of farm families benefiting from the scheme is expected to double, from almost 7,000 to almost 14,000.</P>
    <P>Other budget measures which will support farm incomes include a 21 per cent increase in funding for REPS; increased Exchequer funding for headage; the reopening of the farm investment and installation aid schemes; an increase in the VAT refund and extension of the special stock relief rates.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this package of measures will provide valuable income support for the most vulnerable farming groups.</P>

      <P>Supporting the maximum number of family farms is a key policy priority for this Government, as is clearly indicated in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in the strategy statement of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action in support of this objective in 1998 includes well over one thousand million pounds in direct income payments to farmers.  That is 56 per cent of estimated farm income, or 62 per cent after allowing for interest payments.  This is a 9 per cent increase in payments over the level in 1997, which was itself a record.  These payments <Col N="1303" /> are a very practical expression of public support for farm families and are vital to the viability of many farmers.</P>
    <P>In addition this Government has responded to the specific needs of low income farmers by making provision in the recent budget for the new farm assist scheme.  This initiative is targeted at those farm families with children who are in greatest risk of poverty and will provide further practical support to maintain farm families on the land.</P>
    <P>In relation to Agenda 2000, negotiations are still continuing and are now entering a crucial phase with the objective of reaching agreement by the end of March.  I have made Ireland's position on the current proposals very clear and I will continue to seek changes in the final package to protect the livelihood of Irish farmers, and to ensure the best possible framework for the development of Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium <Col N="1304" /> includes a commitment to establish &ldquo;an independent agency to administer FEOGA and other payments such as premia to farmers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Work has been under way within my Department with a view to giving effect to this Programme commitment, whereby, inter alia, all FEOGA and payment operations would be assembled into a single unit.  I presented a progress report in this connection to the Government in 1997.</P>
      <P>It is intended that implementation of the action programme commitment will avail of the opportunity afforded by the Public Service Management Act, 1997 to introduce innovative management and accountability structures within Government Departments.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in addition to preparing the establishment of the FEOGA agency, my Department has over the past 18 months been engaged in two other substantial projects of an organisational character, in relation, first, to the implementation of the Food Safety Authority Ireland Act, 1998 and, second, the decentralisation of a substantial part of the Department to Wexford, both of which affect the FEOGA operational area and which have of necessity absorbed considerable management time and attention.</P>
      <P>The Department has been engaged, in conjunction with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI), in the development of arrangements for the implementation by the Department of the extensive functions to be conducted by it on behalf of the Authority.  The establishment of the FSAI was a major commitment under An Action Programme for the Millennium.  Given the urgency attached to its progress through the legislative process, it was decided that priority should be given to this issue.  The arrangements being laid down under the FSAI Act, 1998 have considerable organisational implications for the Department, not least because many of the staff engaged on food safety work also carry out functions in relation to FEOGA operations.</P>
      <P>The Department is in the process of transferring to Johnstown Castle, County Wexford, on a phased basis, the work and staff posts of most Dublin-based FEOGA divisions other than those dealing with headage and premia schemes.  Some 290 posts are being transferred on a phased basis, which represents a very substantial decentralisation. The first of the FEOGA Divisions concerned moved to Wexford on schedule in September 1998, and the decentralisation process will be completed over the next year.</P>
      <P>Given that the position on the establishment of the FSAI has been clarified, and that the decentralisation is well under way, it is my intention to proceed with the establishment of the FEOGA agency as quickly as possible.  I would expect to put proposals as regards its establishment to the Government early in 1999.</P>

      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers introduced in 1994 under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry was suspended on 7 August 1997, as all available funding was exhausted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of its suspension there were some 1.500 applications on hands in my Department.  I understand that between 700-800 applications <Col N="1306" /> were being processed by Teagasc and private planners prior to the suspension of the scheme. The majority of the applications with Teagasc and private planners could not be finalised before the closing date due to technical deficiencies, including registration of title in Land Registry.  Some 350 applications submitted to my Department after the scheme was suspended were returned to the applicants and they were informed at that time that it would be open to them to reapply under the revised scheme when it was finalised, subject to meeting the new conditions.</P>
    <P>As regards the revised scheme, national funding of £10 million has been provided for this scheme over a three year period.  This level of funding will allow for the acceptance of some 1,750 applications.  In this connection I would point out that applications will be accepted from eligible farmers who set up in farming from 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>I expect that application forms, along with full details of the new scheme will be available in the local office of my Department within the next two weeks.  The scheme will be widely publicised in the national and farming press.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position on area aid is that some 4,500 from a total of 132,000 1998 area aid applications are still under query.  Of these some 1,500 will receive payments or part payments by the end of the week leaving 3,000 cases which have particularly difficult overclaim problems most of them commonage related.  The area aid unit is currently concentrating all of its resources on the resolution of problems associated with these cases with a view to paying the farmers concerned at the earliest opportunity.  EU Regulations require a 100 per cent check on all land parcels submitted by farmers on their area aid declarations. This ensures that farmers are not overclaiming on individual parcels of land or that two or more farmers are not claiming on the same parcel.</P>
      <P>Of the 132,000 area aid applications received in 1998, some 85,000 required changes to the 1997 data.  Many of these changes had to be redigitised on the land parcel identification system database and in some cases this process results in the creation of dual or overlap claims against a previously clear contiguous farm.  This makes it necessary to establish actual entitlement to the area concerned which can be a difficult and time consuming process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the resolution of overclaim problems is a tedious process it would not be facilitated by <Col N="1307" /> mapping expertise in regional offices.  Indeed, this year the vast bulk of the 85,000 area aid cases involving maps were solved quickly and without undue difficulty.  Similarly, establishment of entitlement to commonage shares is difficult but does not involve any mapping or digitising process.</P>
    <P>I am extremely conscious of the importance of headage and premia payments to farmers and their families.  With this in mind, I successfully approached the European Commission early in the autumn to secure earlier and larger advance payments under special beef and suckler cow schemes.  On the headage side, payments also commenced at earlier dates and I obtained additional funds in a Supplementary Estimate last week to permit me to pay the maximum number of farmers this year.  The record level of payments this year is a testament of my commitment and that of my Department on this issue.  Every effort continues to be made to clear remaining problem cases and make payment in time for Christmas. Farmers too can help by responding to my Department's letters thus opening the way to early payment.</P>

      <P>Exports of Irish beef to EU countries will this year increase by over 8 per cent to about 200,000 tonnes from 185,000 tonnes in 1997.  A decline in sales to the UK was more than offset by increased sales to other important markets notably France, Netherlands, Italy and some of the Scandinavian countries.</P>
      <P>The overall increase in 1998 represents continued recovery of EU market share for Irish beef from a low in 1996 when beef markets became renationalised in the aftermath of the BSE scare. The EU markets offer the most sustainable high value outlets for Irish beef and An Bord Bia's marketing strategy identified the development of these markets in order to secure the long-term future of the Irish beef industry.  I am satisfied that the trend is now in the right direction but, having regard to the competitive nature of the markets, a persistent long-term marketing effort by the industry supported by An Bord Bia is required to ensure further penetration of the EU consumer markets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>At meetings of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers since last March when the detailed proposals for CAP reform were presented by the EU Commission, I have made it very clear that the Irish Government cannot accept the proposals in their present form.  The proposals will not provide for equity between member states and between different types of production and they will involve an estimated net annual loss of £226 million to Irish producers.  I informed the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Council of the economic significance of the Irish interests that would be affected and I obtained acknowledgement of the importance of beef and milk to Ireland by having written into the Conclusions of the Agriculture Council in May a statement that the dependence of particular member states on specific sectors would be taken into account in the final agreement.  I also sought and obtained recognition by the Council in those Conclusions of the need to avoid renationalisation of the CAP and distortion of competition.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Cardiff set the objective of achieving final adoption of the overall Agenda 2000 proposals before the next European parliamentary elections in June 1999 and specified that political agreement could be reached on the package as a whole no later than March 1999.</P>
      <P>Technical examination of the proposals on agriculture has been carried out in recent months and the November Agriculture Council finalised a progress report for the Vienna European Council on 11 and 12 December.  The Vienna European Council reaffirmed that agreement should be reached on the package of measures by the end of March 1999.</P>
      <P>I have put Ireland's case forcefully in bilateral meetings with Commissioner Fischler and with my ministerial colleagues from the UK, Germany, France and Austria.  I have also made arrangements to meet my ministerial colleagues from Spain, Portugal and France in the coming weeks. Discussions have also taken place at official level with a number of member states.</P>
      <P>During the coming months of negotiations, I will continue to strongly promote Ireland's case and to seek support from my ministerial colleagues both in formal meetings and in bilateral discussions.  It is my firm objective to secure a satisfactory outcome for Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the EU Commission proposals for reform in the milk sector are continuing in the context of Agenda 2000.  I have already made clear my objections to certain aspects of the proposals on milk both to the Commission and to my colleagues at the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Among the aspects of the proposals to which I object is the allocation of additional quota between member states.  I have highlighted the economic importance of the milk sector to this country as well as the role of milk production in protecting viability at farm level.</P>
      <P>During the course of the negotiations, which it is hoped will be finalised in March of next year, I will, in relation to any allocation of additional quota, be insisting on an equitable share for Irish milk producers.</P>
      <P>In relation both to small scale producers and those with development plans, it is clear that within the constraints of the existing quota system, considerable efforts have been made to improve the position of these producers.  They continue to have priority access to additional quota under the temporary leasing and restructuring schemes and they also have the possibility of applying to the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal for additional allocations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The overall incidence of BSE has remained constant over the last three years.  As at 30 November 1998, a total of 69 clinical cases of this disease had been confirmed in Ireland during 1998. This compares with a total of 70 cases during the same period in 1997 and 64 for the corresponding period in 1996.</P>
      <P>From 1989 to the end of November this year, 334 cases of clinical BSE have been recorded and a total of 42,489 animals have been slaughtered to date.  This latter figure includes animals from BSE depopulated herds, birth cohort and-or progeny animals, UK imported animals and BSE suspect and affected animals.</P>
      <P>Given that the overall incidence of BSE in the Irish herd is extremely low and given the strict and extensive control systems in place to ensure the safety of Irish beef, I am confident that exports from the Irish beef sector will continue to develop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The disallowance of approximately £18 million in respect of multiple tendering arose from a difference between my Department and the EU Commission on the interpretation of EU legislation.  My Department's interpretation was shared by a number of other member states who <Col N="1313" /> were also subjected to disallowance.  These member states, along with Ireland, appealed the Commission's decision to the European Court of Justice which, however, upheld the Commission's interpretation.</P>
      <P>The disallowances of £50 million in respect of beef intervention storage were applied on the basis of the Commission's assessment of weaknesses in the system in 1990 and 1991.  Ireland has acknowledged that the Beef Intervention Control System was severely over-stretched in 1990 and 1991, when some 470,000 tonnes of beef at a value of £750 million, were taken into intervention over a very short period in an emergency operation.  This was done to prevent a total collapse of the Irish beef market at a time of major international market disruption.  This fact was fully acknowledged in the report of the beef tribunal. Ireland unsuccessfully contested, up to European Court level, some of the bases of the Commission's findings and the extent of the disallowances applied.</P>
      <P>The immediate improvements in the intervention control systems begun in 1991 were recognised by both the Conciliation Body and the Commission, and no disallowances under Article 8 of Regulation 729/70 have been imposed in respect of beef intervention controls since 1991. The control system has been continually and significantly upgraded since then and intake levels have been considerably lower.  This work has been endorsed in the many visits of Commission officials and the Court of Auditors, and in the reports of the certification body appointed under the EU process of accreditation of paying agencies. Disciplinary action against any individual official in the Department did not arise on the grounds that the weaknesses revealed were primarily of a system nature and the intake situation faced in 1990 and to a lesser extent in 1991 was unprecedented.</P>
      <P>The circumstances relating to the second case referred to by the Deputy have been outlined in recent replies to questions.  They relate to the decision by my Department to allocate import licences to a number of meat processors rather than to the company he refers to.  This decision was taken in good faith and was supported by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. It is important in this connection to make it clear that there was no collusion or conspiracy on the part of any officer of my Department.  I am satisfied that while my Department's interpretation of the relevant EU law was subsequently found to be incorrect, and while there were shortcomings in the administrative procedures and customer relations practices employed, disciplinary action is not warranted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that substantial progress has been made towards implementing the national beef assurance scheme, including the traceability elements.  Phase One of the computerised cattle movement monitoring system was introduced on 28 September last when some 40 marts began recording details of the cattle movements through their premises and farmers and dealers began to make notifications about private sales.  Since that date 30 more marts have been brought into the system and the intention is that all marts should be on stream early in the new year.  The procedures for bringing meat plants and live export points into the system are well advanced and these establishments will be brought on stream early in 1999.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the introduction of the wider national beef assurance scheme are also well in hand.  The Government recently approved the drafting of legislation to underpin the scheme and a detailed Bill will be drawn up in the coming months.  In the meantime, the texts of standards to be applied by farms, meat plants, marts etc. have been the subject of extensive consultation with industry partners and it is expected that outstanding issues will be resolved early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards other products, there are a range of quality related measures in place, and while there are no immediate plans to introduce a comprehensive <Col N="1315" /> measure similar to that being implemented for beef, a review is taking place on the issue of food quality and quality standards in general.</P>

      <P>My Department continually monitors the operation of the REP scheme both in terms of compliance by participants with the conditions of the scheme and in relation to the effectiveness of the measures to achieve the objectives of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Compliance checks are carried out on some 50 per cent of participants in the scheme each year. Where compliance failures are discovered appropriate penalties are applied.  These can vary from monetary penalties for failure by participants to complete certain aspects of their environmental plan to suspension or expulsion from the scheme together with reimbursement of moneys paid for more serious breaches of the conditions of the scheme.</P>
      <P>In terms of monitoring the effectiveness of the measures, I point out that as a result of the constant monitoring of the scheme a number of adjustments were proposed by my Department to certain of the measures.  These adjustments were to cover issues which arose in the implementation of the measures.  The Commission in two formal decisions has formally accepted these adjustments.</P>
      <P>In addition to the continuous monitoring of the scheme, my Department intends to carry out a full evaluation of the scheme in the first half of 1999.  An outline of this evaluation was submitted to the European Commission in the summer of 1998.  The Commission has not indicated that it has any concerns in relation to the proposed scope of the evaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 50 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am circulating a table which sets out aggregate and average farm income for each of the years 1992 to 1998, based on data provided by the CSO and Teagasc.  There was a sustained growth both in aggregate and average farm income from 1992 to 1996.  The CSO figures show that aggregate income grew by a total of 32 per cent, while average income per farm grew by almost 50 per <Col N="1318" /> cent over the period.  Teagasc's national farm survey records a growth in average income of 64 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, following these growth years, there was a decline of 6 per cent in aggregate farm income in 1997.  However, Teagasc's national farm survey recorded a lower drop of 1 per cent in average income.</P>
    <P>According to advance figures for 1998 published last week by the Central Statistics Office, aggregate income is estimated to have declined by 5.6 per cent in 1998.  There are no figures yet for average farm income.</P>
    <P>I have taken a range of measures this year to alleviate the income problems, which emanate mainly from the unfavourable weather and the collapse of the Russian market.</P>
    <P>Direct income payments this year are estimated to reach a record level of well over £1 billion, or 56 per cent of farm income, as a result of speeding up of payments and increased advances, as well as the special fodder package.</P>
    <P>Other key actions which I have taken include winning substantial increases in export refunds for beef and pigmeat; getting private storage schemes for sheepmeat and pigmeat; and obtaining increased access to intervention for heavier cattle.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget contains several measures which will help to support farm families over the next year.  In particular, the new farm assist scheme will provide a valuable safety net for the most vulnerable farming families.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to incomes in 1999 is unclear at this stage.  As we have seen this year, factors outside our control, such as the weather and third country markets, can have a major influence on the outcome.  For my part, I will be ensuring that every assistance possible is provided and that direct payments, which are now such an important factor in farm incomes, are made as speedily as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the amount outstanding for payment under each headage and premia scheme for 1998 which under the Charter of Rights should have issued; the percentage of farmers still waiting on payments which will be made before Christmas; the number of applicants still experiencing difficulties with their 1998 area aid applications; and the number of applicants still to be contacted by the area aid unit.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date this year a record level of £804 million has been paid to farmers under the various EU headage and premium schemes.  This compares most favourably with the positions in 1997 and 1996 when £746 million and £788 million respectively were paid at the years' end.  The previous high level of payments in 1996 and 1997 resulted from a concession being obtained from the European Commission to overcome problems associated with the introduction of a new computerised land parcel identification system, LPIS. While the EU concession facilitated large levels of payment in those two years, on the negative side its application resulted in the build up of significant processing backlogs which had detrimental impacts on the following years processing. This was a factor in dealing with 1998 area aid applications.  All payments are now made on the basis of a clear area aid declaration, major advances have been achieved in dealing with area aid applications in 1998.  In the past week alone over £19 million has been paid bringing the total paid out so far under the 1998 schemes to over £503 million.  The corresponding figure at this time last year was £479 million.</P>
      <P>The payment targets under the charter of rights for farmers for the main headage and premium schemes are specific and in 1998 the payment commencement targets have been met or indeed surpassed under these schemes.</P>
      <P>In so far as the 1998 headage schemes are concerned, payment of sheep headage commenced on 21 September, one week ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  To date over £20 million has been paid.  Payments under the 1998 cattle headage scheme commenced on 26 September three weeks ahead of the commencement date in 1997.  Payments under the 1998 beef cow schemes commenced on 30 October 1998.  To date £88 million has been paid to cattle headage and beef cow applicants.</P>
      <P>Of the 89,000 applications received under the 1998 cattle headage and beef cow scheme, some 2,700 applications have not been cleared for payment at local office level because of problems of one kind or another.  In these cases the applicants have been written to and my Department is awaiting responses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second instalment of 1998 ewe premium was agreed at EU level on 2 October.  The regulation giving effect to the rate was published on 16 October and payments totalling £24.699 million <Col N="1320" /> were paid to 97 per cent of applicants during week ending 23 October 1998.</P>
    <P>Payments of the advances under the 1998 special beef premium started on 19 October 1998 as opposed to 1 November 1997 under the 1997 schemes.  I secured this earlier payment date this year with an 80 per cent advance instead of the normal 60 per cent advance in order to increase the cash flow to farmers in the October-December period.  So far over £85 million has been paid.  This compares with £53 million paid at this time last year.  Of the 169,000 January to September applications received, some 6,500 are under query and in these cases the farmers concerned have been written to on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>Payments under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 20 October 1998 which is ahead of the commencement date of 4 November 1997 under the 1997 scheme.  The earlier commencement and higher rate of advance applies also to this scheme.  To date over £102 million has been paid.  The position at this time last year was that £75 million was paid.  Of the 73,500 applications received under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme, over 2,600 are under query at local office level and in these cases the applicants have been written to on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>Payments under the 1998 arable aid scheme commenced on 16 October and, including payments in respect of oilseeds advances, some £90 million has now been paid to 98 per cent of applicants. Those applicants who have not yet been paid, have been written to setting out the reason for non-payment.</P>
    <P>I have also made arrangements for payments under the winter fodder scheme valued at over £10 million to issue this week with payments under the cull ewe supplementary measure to follow before the year's end.</P>
    <P>The position on area aid is that some 4,500 of the 1998 area aid applications are still under query.  Of these some 1,500 will receive payments or part payments by the end of the week leaving 3,000 cases which have particularly difficult overclaim problems most of them commonage related.  The area aid unit is currently concentrating all of its resources on the resolution of problems associated with these cases with a view to paying the farmers concerned at the earliest opportunity.  EU regulations require a 100 per cent check on all land parcels submitted by farmers on their area aid declarations.  This ensures that farmers are not overclaiming on individual parcels of land or that two or more farmers are not claiming on the same parcel.  Of the 132,000 area aid applications received in 1998, some 85,000 required changes to the 1997 data.  Many of these changes had to be redigitised on the LPIS database and in some cases this process results in the creation of dual or overlap claims against a previously clear contiguous farm.  This makes it necessary to establish actual entitlement to the area concerned which can be a difficult <Col N="1321" /> process.  Furthermore, I should point out that not all applications will ultimately be entitled to payment. For example over 1,000 May 1998 suckler cow applicants do not hold suckler cow quotas and are therefore not entitled to payment.  In other cases payments are withheld because of the application of penalties and in some cases farmers omitted to complete an area aid declaration.  As I have pointed out the applicants who have been written to have yet to establish entitlement under the relevant schemes.  It should be noted also that payments do not conclude at the end of the calendar year.  For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef premium scheme the regulations provide for advance payments in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year.  Payments to applicants under the October 1998 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1999.  The House will appreciate therefore that until such time as each application is finalised in conjunction with the farmer concerned it is simply not possible at this stage to provide a reasonable estimate of the value of outstanding payments or the percentage of farmers still awaiting payment in any county.</P>
    <P>I am extremely conscious of the importance of headage and premia payments to farmers and their families.  With this in mind, I successfully approached the European Commission early in the autumn to secure earlier and larger advance payments under special beef and suckler cow schemes.  On the headage side, payments also commenced at earlier dates and I obtained additional funds in a Supplementary Estimate last week to permit me to pay the maximum number of farmers this year.  The record level of payments this year is a testament of my commitment and that of my Department on this issue.  Every effort continues to be made to clear problem cases and make payment in time for Christmas.  Farmers too can help by responding to my Department's letters thus opening the way to early payment.</P>

      <P>The report on the beef sector, which was commissioned by Enterprise Ireland, was designed to identify the most appropriate strategy for the development of the beef industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report did not suggest that there would be substantial job losses and a number of plant closures unless immediate action is taken.  One of the main conclusions in the report, however, was that <Col N="1322" /> there was substantial over-capacity in the cattle slaughtering sector and it recommended that the excess capacity should be removed through the closure of a number of plants leading to a more efficient industry which would be better equipped to exploit the high priced markets in the European Union.  Such a development would, according to the report, also reduce damaging competition between Irish meat factories on third country markets.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report, I set up a task force to prepare a strategic plan of action for the industry covering the complete range of activity from on farm production to processing and marketing.  The report will provide a useful starting point for the work of the task force, but it will not be relied upon exclusively as a basis for drawing up the plan of action.  The task force is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and its members are drawn from senior levels within the Department, industry and the relevant State agencies, including union representation. I have asked the group to submit its report before the end of January 1999.</P>

      <P>The requirement for retention periods during which animals applied on under the various EU headage and premium schemes must be held and maintained by the applicant is an integral part of each scheme and is set out in EU regulations. In the case of the cattle headage and beef cow and suckler cow premium schemes the regulations allow for animals applied on to be replaced by other eligible animals during the retention period.  Retention periods serve to ensure that beneficiaries under the schemes are genuine farmers who normally maintain livestock on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>Different retention periods apply under different schemes ranging from two months in the case of cattle and beef cow headage, sheep headage and special beef premium to 100 days in the case of ewe premium and six months in the case of suckler cow premium.  The longer retention period for suckler cows reflects the fact that these animals are in fact the main breeding stock and are not normally disposed of except in the case of normal stock replacement.  The shorter retention period under the headage and special beef premium schemes reflects the fact that these animals are part of a producers trading stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The putting in place of a traceability system for bovine animals will not negate the need for retention periods.  The fact that movement of animals <Col N="1323" /> will be recorded centrally on a computer database will serve to police compliance with retention period requirements.</P>
    <P>Since most retention periods are set out in Council regulations any variation of retention periods would require the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers.  Any such change would have to be proposed in the first instance by the EU Commission.  It is unlikely that the Commission would agree to a variation in retention periods arising from what could be termed once-off problems in Ireland associated with fodder difficulties.</P>

To advance this development, arrangements are being made for a trial of such a system within a meat plant <Col N="1324" /> and to assess its potential under Irish conditions. I wish to add, however, that any changes along these lines will depend on the practical experience of the mechanical system and will require EU approval.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current brucellosis situation and in consultation with the animal health forum a number of new measures have been introduced to combat the disease.  These measures include the following: from 23 February 1998 all female cattle and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings, other than direct to a slaughter premises, must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; from the same date, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test and such cattle being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding; a full round of blood testing annually for all eligible cattle to augment and complement existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing; revamped administrative procedures to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds; arrangements to speed up the completion of blood tests and the improved notification of results; early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities; increased epidemiology work by my <Col N="1325" /> Department's veterinary staff; an awareness/ advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis; a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the compensation arrangements for herds with BSE are adequate and fair. Average mart prices are used only in relation to calculating compensation for BSE affected animals and not in relation to BSE herd depopulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under S.I. 195 of 1990, where a herd is slaughtered due to a case of BSE in the herd the compensation <Col N="1328" /> payable is the market value of the animals concerned.  Market value is defined as the price which might reasonably have been obtained for the animals at the time of their slaughter in the open market.</P>
    <P>Under S.I. 98 of 1990, the compensation to be paid for a BSE affected animal is the lesser of the market value of the animal or the average price in respect of the month which occurred two months prior to the month in which the animal was slaughtered.  In effect this means that reasonable compensation is being paid for the BSE animal notwithstanding its condition.</P>
    <P>The compensation system in place has worked well over a period of years and I have no plans to amend it at this time.</P>

      <P>My Department has been involved in direct negotiations with the authorities in those traditionally important international markets which had concerns about imports of beef from Ireland.  In the past year, for example, such negotiations have taken place with Russia, Egypt, the Gulf states, Iran and Turkey.  These negotiations with the assistance of both the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia, have secured unhindered access for Irish beef so world-wide <Col N="1329" /> markets.  With the recent reopening of the Iranian market, all traditionally important markets are now open to us.  I am satisfied that the necessary conditions have been secured to enable Irish beef exporters to exploit all available marketing opportunities.</P>
      <P>The level of exports is, of course, influenced by factors other than market access but in the first six months of this year there was an increase of about 7 per cent in total beef exports over the same period in 1997.  The economic crisis in Russia, given our traditional reliance on that market, will obviously adversely affect the final outturn for the year but, needless to say, this is a matter over which we have no control.</P>

Because of the comprehensive nature of this task and to ensure the widest possible representation within its remit, members are drawn from senior levels within the production and processing side of the industry as well as from the relevant State agencies.  Representations were made from many organisations, all of whom have a direct interest in the industry, for membership of the task force.

      <P>Agreement was reached with a Libyan Government delegation in July last providing for the reopening of the Libyan market for Irish cattle and beef on the basis of agreed veterinary health conditions and terms of contracts.  This agreement was the culmination of extensive contacts with the Libyan authorities since early 1997. The Libyan Government, through the General People's Committee, formally cleared the agreement before the end of September and written confirmation to this effect was received. Although the Libyan authorities indicated their wish to have the agreement implemented immediately, there have been delays in the conclusion of contracts for Irish cattle.  In order to establish the reasons for these delays, which were of concern both to myself and the Government, our Ambassador in Rome, who is accredited to Libya, visited Tripoli again in mid-October.  The Ambassador was assured that there was no political blockage to the agreement and that it was now a matter for the Irish exporters to pursue contracts with the purchasing agency in Libyan. Ongoing contact is being maintained with the Libyan authorities through every possible channel with a view to ensuring that the July agreement, <Col N="1331" /> which was accepted by the authorities in both countries, is fully honoured and implemented in practice.</P>

      <P>The report of the EU Commission Inspection Mission to Ireland in March 1998, in so far as it related to the plant to which the Deputy refers, found certain hygiene related deficiencies concerning the loading bay, handling of seized/detained carcasses and the staining of specified risk material.</P>
      <P>In addition, the mission reported serious deficiencies which could allow for the possibility of fraudulent actions inside or outside the slaughterhouse. These included unsatisfactory health marking procedures, trimming procedures leading to the cut-off of health marks, the separation between seized carcasses and EU eligible carcasses, and traceability weaknesses in respect of the age of the bovines slaughtered.  It was made clear by the EU Commission, at a later meeting in Brussels, that the inspection mission had not found any evidence of actual or attempted fraud.</P>
      <P>Arising out of the findings of the mission and its own ongoing review of in-plant veterinary control procedures, my Department took a number of steps including: revised arrangements in relation to marshalling halls and loading bays in all slaughter plants, including the plant to which the Deputy refers; revised procedures for the detention of carcasses in all slaughter plants; tightened procedures for the identification, handling, segregation, staining and removal of specified risk material in all slaughter and cutting plants; and revision of the procedures at local plant level in respect of the evaluation of cattle age for the purpose of facilitating commercial trade.</P>

      <P>I have made it clear on a number of <Col N="1332" /> occasions that I am disappointed with the response of the beef processors to the concessions which I negotiated with Commissioner Fischler last October.  As regards intervention, the quantities offered were significantly lower than expected.  While I take the view that intervention should be used sparingly, I believe that more effective use could and should have been made of the new arrangements.  It is also difficult to understand why a greater proportion of the recent significant increase in refunds has not been passed on to producers in the form of higher cattle prices.  I do acknowledge that, because of the difficult market situation, prices fell on many third country markets and in that context intervention, even though used sparingly, acted as an important alternative.</P>
      <P>In relation to market support in the new year, I made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler last week for an extension of the intervention arrangements.  I am pleased that the Commissioner has agreed to their extension and a proposal to this effect was adopted by the beef management committee on 11 December.  I believe that these arrangements, combined with relatively strong EU and third country markets, should help to underpin cattle prices at higher levels than those currently prevailing and I have called on the meat processors to react accordingly.</P>

      <P>Matters concerning consumer prices and market competition are under the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>While the margin between the farmgate price and the retail price must take account of all the costs right through the food chain, the actual size of the margin will be determined by a number of factors including consumer preference, competition and other market forces.

      <P>The European Union and South Africa are both members of the World Trade Organisation and, as such, are bound by its agreements and rules on trade.  The EU support regime for canned products has been part of EU agricultural policy for many years and is permissible under WTO rules.</P>
      <P>The EU and South Africa have been negotiating a trade and co-operation agreement since 1995.  The negotiations are being conducted on the EU side by the European Commission in accordance with the negotiating mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 1995 and amended by the council in March 1996.</P>
      <P>I support the conclusion of an agreement between the EU and South Africa in accordance with the Council's negotiating mandate.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my recent reply in respect of grant schemes operated by my Department, Parliamentary Question No. 121 of Wednesday 2 December 1998.  In addition, a token Supplementary Estimate was passed recently to approve a nominal amount, £1,000, for the initial administration costs of the millenium celebrations.  However, no grants for the millenium celebrations will come in course for payment until 1999.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for two grants-in-aid, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the National Economic and Social Forum, NESF.  The grants-in-aid for each in respect of 1998 were £384,000 and £500,000, respectively.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the Government decided to reconstitute both the NESF and the NESC on a statutory basis.  Legislation to give effect to this is at present with the Parliamentary Draftsman's Office and it is hoped to introduce the legislation in the new year.  The grants-in-aid for 1998 covered the operating costs of the council and the forum during the year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Vote of my Department in 1998 contains specific financial allocations for a number of bodies under the aegis of my Department. These are as follows:</P>
      <P>The All-Party Committee on the Constitution, £240,000;</P>
      <P>The All-Party Committee on SMI, £50,000; The Information Society Commission, £500,000;</P>
      <P>The National Partnership Centre, £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the arrival of multinational chain stores in Ireland has stimulated changes in practices and procedures in the retail sector.  I have been anxious to keep abreast of these developments and to ensure that Irish suppliers are positioned to benefit from the opportunities arising.</P>
      <P>Indeed, certain multinational chain stores who have established outlets here have given commitments in relation to the sourcing of Irish products.</P>
      <P>In addition, Enterprise Ireland launched its supplier development programme earlier this year to assist Irish companies to respond to these changes.  To date, 27 companies have expressed an interest in the programme.  Of these, four are now at the implementation phase where training and development of staff with specific improvement projects is being addressed.  The remaining companies are being assessed as regards their suitability for strategic change.</P>
      <P>Of course, the creation of the European single market gives the right to any EU multinational chain store to establish retail outlets in other member states and to source freely their supplies from within the European Union.  This is a right which many Irish firms are exploiting very successfully, both in terms of establishing businesses in other EU States and in supplying the EU single market.  Once the relevant provisions of EU competition law are respected and single market rules adhered to, it is not open to me to compel multinational chain stores to source their products in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The ESRI study referred to was completed in February 1998 at which time a copy was made available to my Department.  The report, which established a benchmark for the size and structure of the supplier base to the former Quinnsworth chain over the period March 1996 to February 1997, formed the basis for an indepth evaluation of Tesco's plans to purchase Irish products which was carried out at a meeting involving representatives of <Col N="1339" /> my Department, Enterprise Ireland, An Bord Bia and Tesco Ireland.</P>
      <P>A second ESRI study, which will measure Tesco's purchases of Irish products in the year ended February 1998 is being finalised.  As soon as these results are available discussions will be arranged with Tesco Ireland to review the situation.</P>

      <P>Representatives from the Eastern Regional Fishery Board and the Central Fishery Board are on the local catchment group and the steering committee of the Boyne catchment monitoring and management system.  These representatives are particularly concerned with fisheries interests and keep my Department informed of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the decline in salmon stocks in the Boyne, my priority is to continue to progress my conservation and management strategies for the salmon resource.  The impact of the conservation measures which I renewed for 1998 has been to effectively reduce the commercial salmon <Col N="1340" /> season to the months of June and July.  I am assessing the conservation measures needed for 1999 in light of trends this year, with particular reference to concerns about the state of spring salmon stocks.  The Eastern Regional Fisheries Board along with others has been asked for its advice on salmon conservation measures in 1999.</P>
    <P>I have provided funding in 1999 to progress a tagging and quota scheme in order to achieve real time management of salmon stocks on a shared resource basis, and I have announced the establishment of a National Salmon Management Commission which will have a key role in delivering this new regime and all the related decisions underpinning that approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of wide-ranging concerns expressed by anglers, and indeed many others, about the use of jetskis and fast power-boats on our inland waters and inshore seas.  The concerns expressed suggest that there are instances where, perhaps inexperienced operators of these craft, have shown scant regard for safety. Safety must be a primary and integral part of water sports activities, particularly where power craft are involved.</P>
      <P>As I have stated before, my overriding concern as Minister with responsibility for the prevention of loss of life at sea and the promotion of sustainable development of marine tourism and leisure is to ensure that such craft are operated in a safe and responsible manner.</P>
      <P>I have identified the need for action on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>A Marine Safety Working Group, MSWG operates under the chairmanship of the director of the Irish Marine Emergency Service, IMES of my Department, with the aim of creating and communicating marine safety information and messages, to endeavour to reduce accidents and to prevent the loss of life in Irish waters.  The safety working group meets regularly and has produced a number of Safety on the Water book-lets, leaflets and posters for widespread dissemination. A safety code, for jet skis and fast power boats which is available in &ldquo;poster&rdquo;, &ldquo;flyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;sticker&rdquo; form has been drawn up and is being widely distributed by the Director of IMES.  The purpose of the code is to heighten awareness of the requirement to operate such craft in a safe manner with regard to the safety of other water users.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking steps to ensure that this safety code is communicated to purchasers and users of jet <Col N="1341" /> skis and fast power craft and that suppliers of such craft will assist in disseminating the code. Also, local authorities are being requested to post the code in areas where jet skis and fast power craft are used.  The National Safety Council will also be involved in promoting the code.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute, whose functions include the promotion of the sustainable development of the marine leisure resource, is examining, at my request and with the benefit of independent expertise, the options for the management of the operation of fast power craft.  The examination is, amongst other things, looking at appropriate statutory and non-statutory models for management and promotion of the safe use of such craft. The institute is liaising closely with my Department in the matter and will draw on management models at a number of locations in Ireland and abroad.  In addition, there will be full consultation with interested parties, including public authorities and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>It is clear to me that the control of recreational fast power craft must be addressed on a number of fronts.  My immediate concern is to ensure that progress is made as a matter of urgency in raising safety awareness amongst the users of such craft. The use of statutory mechanisms to regulate such craft has proved complex from both safety and legal perspectives but I am determined that, if statutory measures are identified as being necessary, the various public agencies will agree on a plan of action to implement them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate the Government's total opposition to the use of the death penalty and I would also assure the Deputy that I am committed to availing of every opportunity to press for its abolition.  I was particularly pleased at the success of the resolution on this issue in two consecutive years at the Commission on Human Rights. This has made it very clear that a growing number of countries do not accept use of the death penalty. I believe that this growing conviction must be carefully sustained and strengthened by encouraging more states to support this view.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am pleased to say that the EU has formally recognised the importance of the issue by adopting a set of guidelines for EU initiatives on the issue of the death penalty.  At a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers last June, it was decided to strengthen the Union's international activities in opposition to the death penalty, as an integral part of its human rights policy.  Consequently, the Union now works towards the uni-versal abolition of the death penalty as a strongly held policy agreed by all member states.</P>
      <P>The use of the death penalty in a regrettably large number of countries, including the United States, is of concern to the Government.  On a national basis, and in co-operation with EU partners, we have intervened in a number of cases of particular concern, including the recently much-publicised case of Karla Faye Tucker.  I would refer the Deputy to my statement to the House on 3 February last on this sad case.  More recently, the Austrian Presidency, on behalf of the European Union, called upon the State of Texas to stop the execution of Mr. Stan Faulder who had been on death row for 21 years.  The US Supreme Court subsequently ordered a stay of execution to allow time to consider an appeal.</P>
      <P>I would also like to commend the initiative taken by the Chairman of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Human Rights, Deputy Gay Mitchell, in bringing to the attention of the US authorities his Committee's opposition to the continued use of the death penalty there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland will continue to take a strong position in support of world-wide abolition of the death penalty at all appropriate international fora.  In particular, at the forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March 1999 we hope to build on the success we have achieved to date in persuading a growing number of countries to abolish capital punishment. <Col N="1343" /></P>

      <P>Allocation of the capital provision for buildings under subhead L in my Department's Estimates for 1999 is currently being finalised.  However, with regard to the Curragh Camp, expenditure of about £0.75 million will be provided for in respect of a number of projects which are currently in progress and will be completed in 1999 &mdash; principally the building of an armoury and roof replacement at Connolly Barracks.  Tenders have been sought for the major refurbishment project at the ammunition depot and expenditure on this work in 1999 is likely to exceed £2.5 million &mdash; further substantial financial provision being required in 2000.  It is anticipated that in the normal course some minor capital works will arise during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> A special provision of £6 million will be included in the 1999 Defence Estimates as the first step towards the application of proceeds expected from the sale of barracks to the improvement of Defence Forces' infrastructure and to meet costs associated with the relocation of personnel.  In this context work is expected to commence in 1999 on refurbishment of the swimming pool and on provision of NCO's mess facilities at the camp.  The total cost of these works will be over £4 million.  A number of other projects to provide upgraded operational, living and recreational accommodation at the camp are at an early planning stage.  A reliable forecast of costs likely to arise &mdash; for example, for consultants' fees in advancing the planning process and for building work undertaken in 1999 &mdash; is not yet available.</P>

      <P>The primary responsibility for internal security rests with an Garda Síochána.  The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist the Garda as required.  In this regard, the Garda request the provision of armed military escorts while explosive materials are in transit and such requests are responded to by the military authorities.  I presume this is the matter to which the Deputy alludes.</P>
      <P>In addition the collection and disposal of pyro-technics and time-expired flares has occasionally in the past involved the provision of an armed military escort.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns regarding the export of EU canned fruit and tomatoes to South Africa.  The European Union and South Africa are both members of the World Trade Organisation and as such are bound by its agreements and rules on trade.  The EU support regime for canned products has been part of EU agricultural policy for many years and is permissible under WTO rules.</P>
      <P>The EU and South Africa have been negotiating a trade and co-operation agreement since 1995.  The negotiations are being conducted on the EU side by the European Commission in accordance with the negotiating mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 1995 and amended by the council in March 1996.</P>

      <P>The current development policy for the food industry covers the period 1994 to 1999 and is contained in the food sub-programme of the operational programme for industrial development. This arrangement constitutes the mechanism whereby EU and national funds are made available to the food industry and I am satisfied that it has not detracted from the implementation of food policy.  Under the monitoring provisions for the operational programme for industrial development, there is a special subcommittee which reviews progress under the food sub-programme. These provisions have worked very satisfactorily and have facilitated amendments to the sub-programme as the need has arisen.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to make a direct comparison of overtime in a Department by Department basis because of the differing staff structures and functions carried out.</P>
      <P>In my Department 65 per cent of overtime is accounted for by technical staff mainly employed at export abattoirs.  A significant proportion of this overtime is recouped from the industry.  it is also the case that the seasonal nature of many of the schemes which provide direct payments to farmers create a demand for overtime.  While much of the Department's overtime is not discretionary, arising from necessary early morning-late evening attendance at meat export plants, ports, etc., the situation is constantly monitored to ensure the most efficient use of resources. Special emphasis is placed on ensuring that overtime is necessary and that it provides an enhanced level of service.</P>

      <P>From time to time my Department received documentation from the Irish Seal Sanctuary, ISS.  I am aware from such documentation of the work of the ISS in the care and rehabilitation of injured and distressed seals recovered from Irish national waters.  I have noted that ISS states that it has been involved in Ireland's contribution to the International Year of the Ocean and is engaged in activities around the Irish coastline relating to cetacean strandings, oils spills at sea and monitoring and assistance with international conventions relating to marine matters. I am also aware that the ISS is taking a keen interest in implementation of the research, technology, development and innovation, RTDI, programme which comes under the aegis of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and involves the Marine Institute and a variety of other organisations concerned with the marine resource.</P>
      <P>As its name suggests, the ISS is concerned mainly with the well-being of seals, which are of course marine creatures.  The seals cared for by the ISS are invariably the victims of human activity or natural phenomena in the marine environment.  In short, the ISS, its operations and the context in which it operates are marine-centred. It is clear that my Department does not have responsibility for marine matters.  Support for the activities and operations of the ISS is therefore not a matter for my Department but rather for others who have responsibility for the marine environment and the wellbeing of marine life.</P>

      <P>The position in this case was outlined in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 187 on 24 November 1998.  The person named did not claim headage on any mountain ewes under the 1995 scheme.  Under the 1996 scheme his payment for mountain ewes was limited to 18 sheep based on his mountain acreage as shown on area aid records.  Under the 1997 and 1998 schemes according to this area aid records he did not have any mountain grazings and as a result he was deemed ineligible for payment on his mountain breeding ewes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 137, 139, 140 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The bovine tuberculosis level tends to be cyclical and the 1997 level was the lowest recorded for many years.  Unfortunately, the rate of disclosure of TB reactors is higher this year than in recent years.  An analysis of the reasons for the increase is currently being undertaken and the results will be discussed with the veterinary groups on a scientific sub-group of the animal health forum when these are available.</P>
      <P>Research projects including the specialised work of the TB investigation unit are continuing with the aim of providing new technologies required to eradicate TB.  The research is focused in particular on the role of the badger as well as establishing the best possible information on the causes of the disease spread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the current brucellosis situation and in consultation with the animal health forum a number of new measures have been introduced to combat the disease as follows: from 23 February 1998 all female cattle and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings (other than direct to a slaughter premises) must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement; from the same date, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than <Col N="1357" /> once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test and such cattle being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding; a full round of blood testing for all eligible cattle in 1998 to augment and complement existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing; revamped administrative procedures in my Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds; arrangements to speed up the completion of blood tests and the improved notification of results; early removal of reactors and steps to improve detection of irregularities; increased epidemiology work by my Department's veterinary staff; an awareness/advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis; a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>
    <P>The arrangements to be applied for both TB and brucellosis for 1999 are kept under review in consultation with the animal health forum.</P>
    <P>As regards BSE, my Department operates extensive surveillance and control procedures aimed at reducing the possibility of exposure of cattle to the BSE agent through the ingestion of contaminated feed and simultaneously providing safety assurance to consumers.  Where a BSE suspect is identified the herd in question is immediately placed under official restriction and quarantined.</P>
    <P>Once BSE is not ruled out, suspects are slaughtered and the brains taken to the Veterinary Research Laboratory for examination.  Herds in which a BSE case is confirmed are slaughtered in a dedicated licensed plant, the carcases of these animals are rendered in a dedicated rendering plant and the meat and bonemeal and tallow produced are incinerated.  Also slaughtered at the same plant and products therefrom disposed of in the same way are: all animals which had been previously imported from the UK; the progeny of BSE positive animals and birth cohorts of BSE positive animals.</P>
    <P>The number of herds restricted due to TB and brucellosis in recent years are as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 138 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>From 1989 to the end of November this year, 334 cases of clinical BSE have been recorded.</P>
      <P>The following controls listed are aimed at removing the possibility of exposure of cattle to the BSE agent through the ingestion of contaminated feed and simultaneously provide the best possible assurance of the consumption of Irish beef.</P>
      <P>1.  A surveillance system is in place and all cattle slaughtered in Ireland are subjected to ante-mortem examination.  at the licensed slaughter plant, by an authorised veterinarian.</P>
      <P>2.  Herds in which a BSE case is diagnosed are slaughtered in a dedicated licensed plant, the carcases of these animals are rendered in a dedicated rendering plant and the meat and bone meal (MBM) and tallow produced are incinerated.  Also slaughtered at the same plant and products therefrom disposed of in the same way are:</P>
      <P>all animals which had been previously imported from the UK; the progeny of BSE-positive animals; birth cohorts of BSE-positive animals.</P>
      <P>3.  Knackeries which handle animals dying on-farm are licensed and are operated under the supervision of DAF staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Specified risk materials (SRMs) (defined as (a) the skull, the brain, the eyes, the tonsils and spinal cord of a bovine animal aged over 12 months, and (b) the skull, the brain, the eyes, the tonsils, and spinal cord of a caprine or ovine animal which has a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum.  and the spleen of a caprine or ovine animal) are <Col N="1359" /> removed from the carcases of cattle and sheep at all slaughter plants and knackeries and are rendered at a dedicated rendering plant.</P>
    <P>5.  The offals remaining after 4 above are rendered at 133ºC, bar 3 for 20 minutes in accordance with EU rules.</P>
    <P>6.  The sale, purchase and use of the MBM produced by the process described at 5 above is controlled by licence.  Only feedmills which solely produce pig or poultry rations and farmers dedicated to pig or poultry production are granted licences to purchase and use mammalian MBM.</P>
    <P>7.  Detailed epidemiological investigations to trace the source of the infection are undertaken on each confirmed case of BSE. Cumulatively this comprises a comprehensive range of control measures and the control system has been the subject of very considerable inspection by veterinary authorities in countries which import from us.</P>

      <P>The payment targets under the charter of rights for farmers for the main headage and premium schemes are very specific and in 1998 the payment commencement targets have been met or indeed surpassed under these schemes. EU regulations governing some of the cattle premium schemes also specify payment commencement dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charter targets under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes require that advance payments of 60 per cent commence on 1 November.  Where the retention period is completed by 1 November in the case of special beef premium applicants and 30 November in the case of suckler cow premium applicants, all eligible advance payments will be made by 31 December Payments of the advances under the 1998 special beef premium started on 19 October 1998 as compared to the starting date of 1 November 1997 under the 1997 schemes.  Arising from my approach to the European Commission, I secured this earlier payment date this year together with an 80 per cent advance instead of the normal 60 per cent advance in order to increase the cash flow to farmers in the October-December period. So far over £85 million has been paid in respect of January to September applications.  This compares with £55 million paid at this time last year. <Col N="1360" /> Over 6,500 of January-September applications are under query and in these cases the farmers concerned have been written to on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>Payments under the suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 20 October 1998.  The earlier commencement and higher rate of advance applies also to this scheme.  To date over £102 million has been paid in respect of May 1998 applications.  The position at this time last year was that over £75 million was paid under the scheme.  Some 2,600 of May 1998 applications are under query at local office level.  In all cases the applicants have been written to about the problem.</P>
    <P>The charter specifies that payment under the deseasonalisation slaughter premium will be made within 60 days of application.  In line with this commitment, payments under the 1998 scheme commenced on 10 March in respect of January applications and 99 per cent of applicants have been paid almost £26 million to date.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 1998 ewe premium scheme, payment of the first instalment commenced on 19 June and 91 per cent of applicants were paid on that date.  The second instalment of 1998 ewe premium was agreed at EU level on 2 October.  The regulation giving effect to the rate was published on 16 October and payments totalling £24.699 million were paid to 97 per cent during week ending 23 October 1998.</P>
    <P>Payments will continue to be made under the schemes as problem cases are resolved with a view to ensuring that the advance payments are made in all eligible cases by 31 December 1998 in line with the charter commitments.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations and indeed in line with charter commitments, full payments under the cattle premium schemes must be completed by 30 June in the year following the year of application. I have no doubt that in so far as the 1998 schemes are concerned, this payment deadline will be met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal basis for the ban on the use of hormonal substances and beta-agonists as growth promoters in animal production is founded in European Union directives.  Under relevant national legislation, the Animal Remedies Act, 1993, severe penalties may be imposed by the courts for breaches of the law in this area.  On summary conviction, fines of up to £1,000 and-or imprisonment for up to one year may be imposed; on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £100,000, or in the case of a second or subsequent offence, £250,000, and-or imprisonment for up to ten years may be imposed.  In addition, the court may order the forfeiture of an animal or animal remedy involved in an offence.  Furthermore, a court may ban a person who has been convicted on indictment from holding animals or animal remedies; the duration of such a ban is at the discretion of the court.</P>
      <P>Since 1 July 1996 where an illegal growth promoter is found on a farmers premises or where a residue is found in an animal, the farmer is deemed ineligible for bovine headage or premia payments for a period of one year.  In the case of a repeated infringement, the period may be for up to five years.</P>
      <P>This legislation is enforced vigorously in the interests of public health and the reputation of agriculture industry by the Department's staff in meat processing plants and district veterinary offices as well as by the special investigation unit of my Department.  My Department also co-operates closely with the Garda Síochána in this area.</P>
      <P>In the past two years over 100 persons have been convicted of breaches of veterinary medicines legislation; fines in excess of £330,000 have been imposed by the courts and 41 persons have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment and 25 of these sentences were suspended.</P>
      <P>Results of testing for residues of veterinary medicines has, over the past few years, shown a substantial and welcome decline in the use of growth promoters from a positive level in excess of 4 per cent in 1993 to 0.06 per cent in the first six months of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will shortly adopt regulations to further improve the system of enforcing the legislation banning the use of growth promoters.  While I will be making a detailed announcement on this in the <Col N="1362" /> near future I can indicate at this stage that the measures will include registration of all those involved in trading in animals and the establishment of a system of monitoring for residues by processing plants.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the use of certain antibiotics in animal production to promote growth is currently permitted under EU legislation, However, the Council decided this week to ban the use of four of these antibiotics.  The ban was introduced because of concerns that prolonged exposure through the continuous use of these particular antibiotics, which may be important in human and animal therapy, could lead to the development of resistance in humans.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 12 November last, the rules governing the Single Market preclude any member state from restricting the free movement of goods on grounds of trade.  Equally, no member state can compel its retailers to source supplies from its domestic producers.</P>
      <P>The reality is that some Irish producers have experienced difficulties in securing a market for their products with the multinationals.  In overall terms however, Irish food producers are benefiting and will continue to benefit from the presence of multinational retail outlets here, not least because of the opportunity this provides for access to markets abroad.</P>
      <P>I am confident that real opportunities exist for the Irish supply base to realise its full potential both at home and abroad.  Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia are fully committed to ensuring accelerated progress in this respect in 1999.</P>

      <P>Over 72,000 payments valued at almost £33.5 million have issued to farmers in County Mayo under the various 1998 headage and premium schemes.  At this early stage it is not possible to provide a reasonable estimate of the amounts outstanding in any county as payments do not conclude at the end of the calendar year. For example, under the suckler cow premium scheme and the special beef premium scheme the regulations provide for advance payments in the year of application with balancing payments being made in the following year.  Payments to applicants under the October 1998 suckler cow premium scheme cannot commence until such time as the six month retention period expires in April 1999.</P>
      <P>I should point out also that not all applications received will ultimately qualify for payment. Some 100 applicants under the May 1998 suckler cow premium scheme in County Mayo do not hold suckler cow quota and are therefore not entitled to payment.  Some applicants even yet, have to establish eligibility.  Over 300 cattle headage and almost the same number of suckler cow premium applicants in County Mayo are not yet cleared for payment at local office level. Under the 1998 special beef premium scheme, some 800 applications from County Mayo are under query from Portlaoise.  All of these farmers have been written to at least once.  Payment to others have been withheld because of application of penalties or because they have failed to submit an area aid application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort is being made to have these queries resolved at the earliest opportunity with a view to having all eligible applicants paid their entitlements by the year's end. <Col N="1364" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>As I said in my Budget Statement on 2 December 1998, the Government is conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system.  The question of child care tax relief raises important and complex issues.  There is the question of equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional child care expenses when they go out to work.  There is also a need for a balanced treatment of those who are in the tax system and those who rely on social welfare benefits and for finding the right balance between measures to help towards the cost of child care and measures to improve the supply and quality of child care facilities to meet the growing demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has discussed this area in some detail and proposes to examine the matter further.  In doing so it will take into consideration <Col N="1365" /> the recommendations of the P2000 working group on child care which has not yet finalised its report.</P>
    <P>As a means of facilitating and encouraging the supply of child care facilities, the Government has decided that the provision of crèche facilities by employers will not be subject to a charge to income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind. Furthermore, the Finance Bill will also provide for capital allowances to allow for the write off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.  This capital allowances regime will also extend to providers of child care services generally in the community.</P>
    <P>Those with children will also be helped by increases in child benefit which I also announced in my Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>This is a complex and sensitive area which, as I have already stated, the Government wishes to examine further, taking into account the results of the various major studies already completed and still ongoing.  I do not expect to be introducing any major new initiatives in the Finance Bill over and above those announced in my Budget Statement.</P>

    <P>Receipts for 1998 are expected to be just under £53 million.  Projections for future years will be affected by the proposed cut in betting tax from 1 July 1999 for which I made a prudent provision of £12 million reduction in revenue in 1999 and <Col N="1366" /> £24 million in a full year, although, as I pointed out in my budget speech, I am of the view that the reduction will increase betting activity and help recover receipts lost.</P>

      <P>The meeting lasted one hour and two main topics were discussed, namely the EU budget and the German contribution to it and tax co-ordination within EU.  Mr. Lafontaine and myself set out our respective positions on various matters relating to these two issues.  It was not a negotiating session but a preliminary exchange of views in the light of the fact that Germany will take over the EU Presidency on 1 January next.  I made it clear that as far as Ireland was concerned tax harmonisation was not part of the scenario and that I favoured the route proposed by Commissioner Monti which was the code of conduct group.</P>

Their report included proposals for funding of their development strategy under the next National Development Plan 2000-2006.  While my Department is responsible for the overall strategic formulation of the plan it would be a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Food who has responsibility for the horse industry sector to assess in the first instance the appropriateness of making provisions within that sector for the association's development strategy.</P>

      <Quest>the threshold which applies for gifts and inheritance taxes between an adult and her niece; if there are any special considerations, or exemptions where the recipient is disabled and wheelchair bound; the other special provisions, if any, which exist allowing for a gift to be given or expenses to be paid over a period to a wheelchair bound person.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the threshold which applies for gift and inheritance tax between an adult and her niece is £25,120 where the benefit in question is taken on or after 2 December 1988 and the niece has not taken any other gift or inheritance since 2 December 1988.</P>
      <P>While there are no special considerations or exemptions where the recipient is disabled and wheelchair bound, there are a number of provisions which may be relevant in this case.  These include: where the inheritance in question consists of a house and the niece has resided in the house with the aunt for ten years and does not own any other house, she may be entitled to reduce the value of the house for inheritance tax purposes by 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser; payments made for the support, maintenance or education of the niece may qualify for exemption from gift tax where the aunt stands <i>in loco parentis</i> to her niece or the aunt is entitled to claim dependent relative allowance for income tax purposes in respect of her niece and payments made exclusively for the purpose of discharging the medical expenses of the niece, including the cost of maintenance in connection with medical care, may also qualify for exemption where the niece is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental infirmity.</P>
      <P>A further relief is also available, in certain circumstances, where the gift or inheritance in question consists of property used in a business, or shares in a company carrying on a business, and the niece has worked in the business substantially on a full time basis for a period of five years.  In the event of such a situation arising the niece may qualify for the &ldquo;child threshold&rdquo; of £188,400 where the benefit is taken in 1998.</P>
      <P>Finally, the first £500 of the taxable value of all gifts taken by the niece from her aunt in any one year is exempt from gift tax.  However, in this year's budget I increased this annual gift tax exemption limit to £1,000 for gifts taken in 1999 and subsequent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not collect information on the non-scheduling of hospital appointments in particular specialities.  While in certain circumstances, hospital facilities may be closed on a temporary basis to enable activity to be brought into line with service plan targets and available funding, <Col N="1368" /> the scheduling of consultant out-patient clinics would not normally be directly used for these purposes.  It would be expected, however, that the schedule of appointments for patients would be related to overall projected activity in a particular speciality and would take account of the clinical needs of individual patients.</P>
      <P>It is important that, in the event of the non-scheduling of hospital appointments, these are viewed in the context of overall levels of activity delivered in the acute hospital sector against agreed service plans.  It should be noted in this regard that overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to September 1998 shows an increase of 1.11 per cent over the same period in 1997 and there is a corresponding increase in day activity of 6.78 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note from the details I have forwarded to him that waiting times in a number of key specialties have fallen for both adults and children.  In the case of adults, there was a noticeable decline in the proportion of patients waiting for longer than the maximum target period of 12 months in cardiac surgery, orthopaedics, plastic surgery and general surgery.  For children, there <Col N="1369" /> were significant falls in the proportion waiting for longer than the target period of six months in orthopaedics, surgery and urology.</P>
      <P>I have provided for a total of £20 million for waiting list activity in 1999.  This is a 66 per cent increase over the amount provided in 1998 and is 2.5 times higher than the sum of £8 million provided by the previous Government for 1997.</P>
      <P>I have published the report of the review group on the waiting list initiative and am committed to ensuring that its recommended approach is implemented.  Towards this end, the extra funding in 1999 of £9 million for services for older people and £2 million for accident and emergency services will be important in helping to free up acute hospital beds which are currently occupied by those not needing acute care.  This is a key element of the approach recommended by the review group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned indicated in her letter to me on 4 September 1998 that she received anti-D in 1972, 1973, 1974 and 1982.  Her letter was replied to on 29 September.  Every batch number of anti-D has been identified.  My Department has been advised that a total of 621 batches were manufactured between 1970 and 1994.  Some 336 of these batches have been tested for the presence of hepatitis C including all batches sourced from plasma taken from patient X. In the years 1973-86, 62 batches were manufactured of which 41 have been tested.  In relation to the period prior to October 1973, archived samples of batches produced are not availing for testing but the Blood Transfusion Service Board has advised that it has no evidence to suggest that these batches were infectious.  In the period September 1973 to December 1973, eight batches were manufactured and six were tested.  In 1974, 32 batches were manufactured, 22 were tested.  In 1982, 29 batches were manufactured and 16 were tested.</P>
      <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has tested all batches where there is evidence of infection or potential infection.  It has also tested batches which were selected to be representative of the various donors to the plasma pool, to rule out the possibility of infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person in question has advised that her <Col N="1370" /> hepatitis is type 2.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board has confirmed that extensive scientific testing of anti-D batches carried out in the University of London Medical School and the University of Edinburgh has not shown any evidence of type 2 infections associated with that product.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Oireachtas enacted the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, which established the compensation tribunal. Section 4(8) of the Act provides that a claimant shall establish to the satisfaction of the tribunal, on the balance of probabilities, that the hepatitis C resulted from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D within the State.  It is a matter for the tribunal, therefore, to make a determination on causation in each individual case. Section 5(15) of the Act provides for an appeal to the High Court by a claimant in respect of any decision made by the tribunal.</P>

      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board, in consultation with voluntary sector service providers, user groups and parents, has drawn up plans for a regional facility in Waterford to provide services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. This will be discussed with the board's regional co-ordinating committee for physical and sensory disability services in the context of deciding on priorities for the allocation of funding available in 1999 for the development of these services.</P>
      <P>In 1999 additional funding of £9.4 million revenue &mdash; £12.4 million full year cost in the year 2000 &mdash; is being made available for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities, of which £3 million &mdash; £6 million full year cost in the year 2002 &mdash; is for the development of the services. In addition, £4 million is being made available for capital projects.  Of the £3 million for development, £100,000 has been allocated to the South-Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>A review of the local improvements scheme, LIS, which my Department carried out in early 1998 established the number of LIS applications on hands at that time in each county council, including Clare.

      <P>It is desirable to reduce further the backlog of LIS applications on hand in county councils.

My Department has recently asked county councils for information on the numbers of LIS applications currently on hands.  This information will enable me to assess the impact that the increased funds in 1998 have had on the backlog of applications and will be taken into account in the allocation of the 1999 LIS moneys to county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1999 budget provides for major increases in child benefit of £3 per month for the first two children and £4 per month for the third and subsequent children, which will bring the rates payable from September 1999 up to £34.50 and £46 respectively.</P>
      <P>This substantial investment in child benefit, involving a full-year cost of over £40 million, was influenced primarily by the fact that the Government considers child benefit to be one of the more effective mechanisms available for the provision of child income support.  It is effective in tackling poverty as it channels resources directly to the main carers of children and is of particular importance to families on low incomes.  As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>Child income support policy in recent years has therefore sought to ensure that the supports provided by the State are more neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents and the approach taken in the 1999 budget is consistent with this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of childcare raises wider issues than child benefit; these were set out by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the course of his Budget Statement.  These issues include the need to ensure equity between parents who stay at home to care for children and those who have to meet additional childcare expenses when they go out to work.  Similarly, there is a need to <Col N="1377" /> ensure that there is a balanced treatment between those who rely on social welfare benefits and those who are in the tax system.  There is also a need to ensure that the right balance is struck between measures to help towards the cost of childcare and measures to improve the supply and quality of childcare facilities to meet the growing demands.  All of these issues will be the subject of further examination by the Government, which will take into consideration the recommendations of the working group on childcare, established under the Partnership 2000 agreement, when that group's report is finalised.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a planning application was submitted in August 1998 to Mayo County Council in respect of a proposed new dwelling at south Iniskea Island, a copy of which was subsequently forwarded to my Department.  The proposal involved the demolition of an existing dwelling and the construction of a new dwelling on the site of the original.</P>
      <P>Following a review of the application, my Department recommended that permission should be refused as the proposed development would have resulted in the demolition of a recorded monument and this was conveyed to Mayo County Council.  Following receipt of this recommendation the applicant withdrew his request.</P>
      <P>In addition, my Department has been consulted recently about a revised proposal for development on the island and this proposal is under active consideration.</P>

      <P>There is no entitlement to parental leave in respect of children born before 3 June 1996.</P>
      <P>The Parental Leave Act, 1998, which came into operation on 3 December 1998 transposes the EU Directive on Parental Leave (96/34/EC) into Irish law.  The Act applies only to parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996 or adopted on or after that date.  The leave must be taken before the child is five years, subject to a certain modification in the case of an adopted child.</P>
      <P>The directive sets down parameters for parental leave but it left much to the discretion of member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive does not specify any form of retrospection in respect of parental leave.  Granting the right to parental leave in respect of children under the maximum age limit who were <Col N="1386" /> born before 3 June 1996 would mean that parents of children now aged three or four would seek to take their leave before the child reaches the age of five, which would mean a large demand for parental leave in the initial years of the scheme's operation.</P>
    <P>In the context of my Department's consultations with the social partners in accordance with a commitment under Partnership 2000, IBEC wanted a more restrictive system of parental leave than is provided for in the Act.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has argued that the directive provided that all children under the age limit set by member states were eligible for the leave.  In an effort to achieve a balanced approach on the matter between, on the one hand, the concerns of employers regarding a large demand for parental leave in the initial years of the scheme's operation which might arise if full retrospection were granted and, on the other hand, the expectations of parents with young children, it was decided that entitlement to parental leave should be given to parents of children born on or after 3 June 1996 the date on which the directive was adopted by the Council of the European Union.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that when a person is stopped for speeding the Garda has the following two options.  First, the Garda may take the person's name and address and proceed by way of summons after administering an oral warning of intention to prosecute.  Incorporated in the oral warning would be the actual speed detected. Second, the Garda has the option to issue to the motorist an on the spot fixed penalty notice which states the actual speed detected.  When speed is detected and the speeding vehicle is not stopped by the Garda, a warning notice is posted to the registered owner giving him-her an option to pay the fixed penalty within 14 days of receipt of the notice.  The actual speed detected is included on the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also understand that a summons requiring the attendance of a defendant motorist in court does not on its face allege the actual speeding offence alleged to have been committed.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the procedures described above have operated effectively <Col N="1387" /> and they currently have no plans to change them.</P>

    <P>In the period since I took office, the Government approved prisons building programme in place at my Department, has already produced an additional 212 places at Castlerea and Limerick Prisons.  That building programme is on target to complete a further 480 places by early next year at the new remand prison at Cloverhill and the new women's prison beside Mountjoy, and, thereafter, before the end of 1999, an additional 515 places at the new Midlands Prison, Portlaoise. Thus, a total of 995 additional new prison places will be completed between now and the end of 1999.</P>

      <P>The position as regards administration of sentence on transfer in respect of the person referred to in the question was previously addressed in my reply to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 134 on Wednesday, 1 April 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may further wish to note that Article 9 of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons states that &ldquo;the enforcement of the sentence shall be governed by the law of the administering State and that State alone shall be competent to take all appropriate decisions&rdquo;. This includes for instance the rules relating to eligibility for conditional release &mdash; as quoted from the explanatory report to the Convention. The sentence of the person referred to in the question is therefore being administered under the laws and regulations of the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Northern Ireland authorities did however advise that occasional periods of parole could be granted as part of a pre-release programme following review by the life sentence review board. Again, the Deputy will be aware from my previous reply that the criteria used in reviewing such cases are similar to those applied in the review of cases here by the sentence review group.  I am not aware if the prisoner visited this jurisdiction while on temporary release.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1389" /> There is no set hourly rate for overtime.  Overtime is linked to the pay of the officer involved; so the higher an officer is on his scale or in grade, the higher the hourly amount payable.  The rate payable also varies in respect of the accumulated hours per week, namely, the first three hours overtime per week are paid at the rate of time and a quarter, the next five hours at time and a half and the remainder at double time.  There are also special rates payable in respect of Sunday and public holiday overtime.  Overall, the average amount paid per hour, in the first half of 1998, was approximately £19.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, without expending a disproportionate amount of staff time, to ascertain exactly the extra hours worked by the officers above.  However, the level of overtime earned by the top officer above equates to approximately 36 basic hours extra per week. That level of extra attendance is, however, not sustainable.  Currently, the whole issue of overtime is actively being addressed, through a range of measures, by prisons management in conjunction with the governors with particular emphasis on high individual earnings.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the strong local support for a new pool in Cobh.  However, the total provision in this year's Estimates of £4 million for the construction and refurbishment of swimming pools, is fully committed to projects under construction or to projects already approved and on which work is expected to commence shortly.  These projects also give rise to commitments of some £6 million in 1999 and subsequent years.  In addition, there are over £40 million worth of projects including Cobh &mdash; at various stages of planning, which are also seeking funding.  Therefore, as formal approval of contract documents and permission to go to tender can only be given when the necessary funding, for the project is available, I cannot give approval at this time, to the proposals for a new pool in Cobh. <Col N="1390" /></P>

Criteria for recognition purposes are currently being revised by the Irish Sports Council, soon to be put on a statutory basis under legislative proposals currently before the Oireachtas and it has been suggested to the association that they might consider preparing a submission to the council in this context.</P>

      <P>Since the publication of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, the number of visiting teachers allocated by my Department to the visiting teacher service for travellers has been increased from 12 to 20.  I will be keeping the question of further development of this service under ongoing review.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I announced the establishment of an advisory committee on traveller education. The composition of this committee will include traveller representatives and will give travellers a real voice in shaping educational provision for future generations of traveller children and adults.  In the context of the recent budget, I have also arranged an allocation of £300,000 over the next two years to provide special increased rates of capitation in respect of traveller children attending second-level schools.  I am confident that this development will act as an encouragement to second-level schools to meet the needs of local traveller children.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the correspondence referred to by the Deputy.  I have asked my officials to respond as soon as possible, but not later than the end of December, to the specific points raised in the correspondence.  My Department does not have a psychological service available to the area where this child lives.  However, in view of the child's special needs, a psychologist from my Department was asked to draw up an individual educational plan in consultation with the child's parents and the school which he attends.</P>

    <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of a full or part-time resource teacher or child care support depending <Col N="1397" /> on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.  The school which the child attends is one of a number of schools that will be considered in the context of this new arrangement for full or part time resource teacher support.</P>
    <P>I have recently allocated a special needs assistant to facilitate the special needs of this child in his local national school.</P>

      <P>My Department facilitated the development of the certificate programme in question as one of a range of inservice programmes for staff within Youthreach and senior traveller training centres with no formal teaching qualifications. Staff in this category are facilitated to attend the programme through financial assistance towards fees.  Those who successfully complete the programme are awarded a certificate in further education and training from Dublin City University. DCU is an independent university and the question of NUI certification does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department does not specify minimum qualifications criteria for employment or promotion within Youthreach, but has identified a range of key characteristics which, with relevant experience, are needed for employment in the programme.  It would be expected that qualifications would be among the criteria which would be taken into account at local level in selection for appointment or promotion. <Col N="1398" /></P>

      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>The number of superintendents appointed for the leaving and junior certificate examinations is determined by the number of examination centres required to accommodate candidates. Normally teachers are appointed to these positions. As the number of applicants usually greatly exceeds the number of centres, priority is given to teachers who are unemployed or are employed in a substitute or part-time capacity.  Otherwise appointments are made on the basis of seniority and applicants who are not appointed are on a reserve panel.</P>
      <P>In making appointments from the reserve panel other factors, such as location of the vacancy and the nature of the appointment, for example, student in hospital, are taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1998 the percentage of appointees aged from 20 to 30, inclusive was 5.5 from 31 to 40, inclusive, was 18.9 and from 41 to 50, inclusive, was 42.9. <Col N="1401" /></P>

      <P>As explained in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 15 October 1998 in this matter, the enrolment of 125 pupils at St. Brigid's national school in September 1998 does not warrant the sanction of an additional teacher for the 1998-9 school year.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment at Castletara national school on 30 September, 1997 was 53 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and one teacher for the 1998-9 school year.  While the enrolment of the school has increased to 59 pupils, in September 1998, there is no basis for the appointment of an additional teacher to the school at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the case that special arrangements granted to students who sat the junior certificate examination in 1996 are being withdrawn when those students come to sit the leaving certificate examination.  Any such student will continue to have his-her application assessed in light of the most up-to-date information provided in relation to the application.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.  However in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner. This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty which might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination. This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in assessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure problems with readability <Col N="1403" /> whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The change is operational in nature and, as I have already explained, does not involve any change in the actual marking of examination material submitted by students with specific learning difficulties.  Every effort will continue to be made to ensure full credit is given for work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as was the case in 1996, be required to apply the agreed <Col N="1404" /> marking schemes consistently to all candidates to ensure equity and fairness.</P>
