      <P>In line with a commitment under Partnership 2000, a working group on basic income, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is examining the viability and suitability of introducing a system of basic income. My Department has commissioned a study to be carried out in two phases by economic consultants. This independent study will assist the working group in producing as comprehensive and robust a consideration of the subject as possible.</P>
      <P>The overall purpose of the study is to consider and evaluate the economic, social, budgetary and administrative impact of the introduction of a basic income system.  The first phase, which examines the costs and distributional analysis of a basic income, is now nearing completion.  The second phase, which will commence shortly, will consider the dynamic effects of such a system from a broad economic and social perspective and will draw on the findings of phase one.  I hope the overall study will be completed in the spring of 1999.</P>
      <P>This study is the first step in the Government's consideration of the question.  When the findings of the independent study are available, the matter will be considered in detail by the Government and a Green Paper will be published as per An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>There is an element of <i>déja vu</i><Col N="190" /> about this.  A similar question was the first tabled following the Christmas recess.  The answer is not much different.  Does the Taoiseach need to be reminded that the Government presides over more poverty since last Christmas?  More people have become richer, the gap is widening and both are linked.  Will he give this matter greater urgency?  He mentioned spring as a publication date.  Will he be more specific about when the first and second phases of the report will be published so that we can prepare to consider the matter more fully?</P>

      <P>The first phase of the work is almost complete.  The first report is in and some work is being undertaken to finalise it.  It will hopefully be ready in one month.  The first part will involve the evaluation of the economic, budgetary and distributional impact of the introduction of the basic income system in Ireland. That work was carried out by a team comprising the ESRI and Professor Charles Clark from St. John's University, New York, who was the co-author of <i>Pathways to a Basic Income.</i>  Getting Professor Clark to work with the ESRI was felt more likely to resolve the fundamental issues of what was possible.  They will try to reach an agreement, sign off on it and then move to the second phase.  It appears they will begin the second part in November.  Realistically, it will take them about three months so it will be early spring before the work is completed.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the family income supplement as constituted provides a basic floor under family income, with one or two exceptions, one being that it is not available to the self-employed and farmers where their incomes fall below this floor?  Is the Government considering the extension of FIS to comprehensively include all occupations and not just some as a step towards basic income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the studies will look at how best a basic income can be provided and if it is possible to do so.  The big difficulties in the basic income system will be the distributional effects, the necessary increases in taxation and whether the system will operate.  I am very familiar with the CORI work originally carried out on this and the argument centred on distributional effects.  I am sure they will look at how best to do it.  Of course, FIS is one area which can be looked at, but there are downsides in the way is it calculated. It is calculated in a way that is not behind the thrust basic income is trying to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true as reported that the Taoiseach said if one was to extend FIS to the farming community and the self-employed it would cost £70 million extra annually?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Professor John Clark's work which is very reputable and I look forward to the report given his involvement is central to it.  In the context of Government policy, does the Taoiseach recognise the need for complementary taxation reform to make this proposal a reality and that it is not sufficient to merely use the CORI proposals which are confined to a remit that is a Government one?  Will he take into account that, aside from the different allowances, the benefit of a guaranteed basic income is its unconditional nature and the way it would remove the level of dependency that has besieged many poor people who fear they may lose their allowances?  That is its appeal which must be sold to the policy makers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have undertaken to ensure this report will be as comprehensive as possible and published as soon as possible.

The Government is committed to maintaining and enhancing our growing competitive economy and making sure that the fruits of that are spread as evenly as possible through existing mechanisms and, if necessary, new ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> The concept of a basic income is to establish a floor of income below which the income of a family or individual would not fall.  Therefore, it should be set at a level to eliminate poverty and hardship which so many families endure.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the setting of a legally underpinned minimum wage is a step in the direction of providing a decent basic income for everyone?  In view of the rising cost of living, the drastic situation in the housing market and the large profits accrued by business over the past few years, will the Taoiseach bring forward the timetable for the legal implementation of a minimum wage?  Will he also agree that in view of the points I made, the £4.40 hourly minimum wage level set for the year 2000 is derisory and that a £6 hourly minimum wage should be the minimum contemplated with immediate effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is ongoing on a minimum wage and discussions are taking place on how it can best be achieved.  I do not consider the hourly rate of £4.40 derisory, but in the fullness of time the figure will have to be considered and agreed. The figure is hotly disputed on both sides.  It is <Col N="192" /> important that we give all the people concerned an opportunity of employment.  The more people who get employment, the better the opportunities they will have to break the cycle of exclusion, poverty and disadvantage.  The Deputy is correct in that a legal minimum wage is part of the solution. Deputy Sargent's question was more concerned with those who are unemployed.  When the final study is completed in spring it will show the distribution effect of a basic income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House if the £4.40 hourly rate is the figure he has in mind or is it lower or higher than that?  Will he agree that tackling basic income is not much good unless we tackle poverty traps such as the use of gross income to assess entitlement to a medical card and local authority rents?  That needs to be tackled in tandem with introducing a basic minimum wage if poverty traps are to be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the agreement and discussions between the social partners and the Tánaiste on the minimum wage have not been concluded, I do not want to speculate on what the figure will be, but, as Deputy Higgins said, figures have been mentioned.  All measures possible should be taken to eliminate poverty traps and make the system easier.  A number of poverty traps have been eliminated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the health boards in recent years.  This has made the system easier to use and ensured the level of social welfare benefits or take home pay of less well off people can be used to better effect.  Anything that can be done in that regard is a help.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government undertook to examine whether the system would work.  I am not prepared to state my conclusion until the report is available.  As Deputy Quinn is aware, there were huge divergences in previous studies by CORI and the ESRI on this area.  Each side did not accept the findings of the other.  An effort will be made in this study to reach an agreed conclusion, if that is possible given the dynamics of the changes involved.  Such changes have not been made elsewhere.  Examples of the position in other countries have been given but they do not involve a basic minimum wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I chair the meetings of the Ministers and Secretaries General group on EU policy, the last meeting of which took place in my Department on Thursday, 24 September.  Last week's meeting was the fifth meeting of the group since the beginning of the year.  As part of its general supervisory role in relation to EU policy the group is responsible for co-ordinating the Irish approach to the key European issues, including enlargement, institutional reform and the Agenda 2000 negotiations.  In this context, last Thursday's meeting concentrated on aspects of each of these topics, including the issue of regionalisation.</P>
      <P>While the group, which is co-ordinated by my Department, has a central role in shaping the strategy to be adopted in the Agenda 2000 negotiations and, therefore, has examined the assessment undertaken by the Department of Finance of the implications of a regionalisation approach, a final decision on this issue is a matter for Government.  No final decision has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the timescale for negotiations, I do not intend to ask NESC to report on the question of Objective One status.  There is sufficient expertise and knowledge of the issues, not least in the light of the plans of the eight regional authorities together with the submissions received from other interested parties, to allow full consideration <Col N="194" /> of the regionalisation issue by Departments and ultimately by Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the constructive leaks to the media about the Government contemplating the division of the country into two separate regions, one with Objective One status and the other without, is it the case that agreement has not been reached either by the committee which the Taoiseach chairs or the Cabinet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding progress, the Government has considered both sides of the issue in recent months in terms of whether to seek Objective One status for the entire country, as was sought during negotiations on the last two rounds of funds in which I was involved, or to argue for sub-regions.  It is possible that NUTS II areas could be negotiated with the Commission. Some reports suggest it is only a matter of the Government deciding to divide the country. However, that is not the case.  Other member states have divided in a similar manner but it requires Commission approval.  We have to look at the statistical data to determine which regions would qualify and consider whether this would be to our benefit in the long term.  There are arguments on both sides.  An excellent paper has been prepared based, among others, on the report produced last December by the ESRI on rural development in the period 1950-1995.  The matter has been referred to Government for decision. The Agenda 2000 negotiations will probably commence after the special summit to be held under the auspices of the Austrian Presidency on 24-25 October.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that Commission agreement is required to divide the country into regions.  The Eurostat figures would have to be examined to determine which regions were below the figure of 75 per cent of GDP in the relevant years.  We did not make this assessment in Opposition.  We are now in a position to consider what Objective One status would mean in financial terms for the country as a whole or if we decide to divide the country into regions. The Government wishes to ensure all aspects are taken into account.  What benefits would accrue if the country is granted Objective One status up to 2006?  It looks likely that we will have access to Cohesion Funds for a four year period.  What would happen after 2006 if subregions are not granted Objective One status?  The question of State aids also has to be considered.  These are extremely important questions which will have to be addressed before we enter serious negotiations. We now have all the data, we have made presentations and have had discussions.  We will make a decision on the issue well in advance of entering negotiations.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the report entitled &ldquo;The Regional Problem: Regional Incomes and Urban Deprivation&rdquo; by P.J. Drudy and Michael Punch of the Department of Economics, Trinity College Dublin, which was published this month?  Has the Government taken that report into consideration?  It was prepared with a view to examining whether areas such as Dublin should be excluded from Objective One status and shows that there is massive deprivation in urban areas of the State.  Dublin has the second highest long-term unemployment rate after the west.  It is 52 per cent in Dublin and 53 per cent in the west. Has that report been taken into account?  It would have a major bearing on the case the Taoiseach hopes to make to the European Council.</P>

      <P>To repeat what I have said, the work of the NESC, the NESF and other bodies regarding rural distribution has been examined in the Department of Finance paper which has been prepared on this issue.  The assessment for that paper will also influence the discussions on Agenda 2000, as these matters are affected by the Common Agricultural Policy and other issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have negotiated on the basis of Objective One single region status in the last two rounds. Funds will be reduced in the next round anyway. Many people seem to miss the fact that fewer resources will be available under the rule regarding 1.27 per cent of GNP.  We can maintain that single region status, negotiate on that basis, conclude the agreement for 2000 to 2006 and end Structural Funds.  That is what will happen at this <Col N="197" /> stage of negotiations and my assessment of what has happened at the European Council and ECOFIN meetings to date suggests that will not change.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to explore the possibility of isolating regions with less than 75 per cent of GDP as a means of holding on to Structural Funds for those regions after 2006.  There is also the case that grant aid for those areas will be higher for a period into the future.  On the basis of Eurostat figures, one would not be able to pinpoint blackspots in certain areas.  If an entire region is not under 75 per cent, one cannot isolate blackspots within it.  The alternative is to subsidise those areas from Exchequer funds, which will probably happen after 2006.  These are the issues which are very important and which must be decided on.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he accepts that the object of the exercise is not to maximise the global amount of money coming to the State but to maximise the amount of money coming to those people who need it most?

      <P>The Taoiseach gave a comprehensive reply setting out the alternatives &mdash; Objective One status for the whole country in transition or for that portion of the country which falls below the 75 per cent GDP ratio, leading to the prospect of enhanced entitlements beyond 2006.  Is the Government contemplating a regional structure of devolution explicitly constructed so as to maximise the attraction of EU Structural Funds for seven years and, perhaps, a maximum of a further seven years?  Is that a correct understanding of the two options the Government is considering?  To maximise the attraction of funds to be dedicated to a specific region of 13 counties, will the Government construct an entirely new structure of regional devolution for those 13 counties?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.  If we remain in this position, Structural and Cohesion Funds will end in 2006.  There would probably be two divisions of NUTS II, no one would contemplate three regions.  At this stage of negotiations the difference in terms of money is very little. That would not influence the decision in terms of money.  However, areas such as the Border region and some western counties are well below the 75 per cent GDP ratio.  Demographic, national, European and other statistics indicate that these areas will stay below that figure for the long term. In that case, with the Commission's agreement, there could be a possibility of retaining European funds for these areas over the long term.</P>

What role does the Taoiseach see for the Euro 11 Council in guiding the exchange rate policy to be pursued by the European Central Bank, given that policy on this issue is shared between the Council of Ministers and the bank?  It is not the sole preserve of the bank in accordance with the treaty.  Will the possible retention of Objective One status after 2006 be settled in the context of the Agenda 2000 negotiations as a whole, or will it be settled separately in advance or thereafter?  What is the Taoiseach's view on the suggestion that Germany is receiving comparatively less from Europe, in proportion to what it is contributing, than any other country and that the Agenda 2000 negotiations will involve cooking the books to give Germany more money?</P>

The intention was that it would be wrapped up in the life time of the present European Parliament.  A timescale was set out for the preliminary negotiations to start at the end of this month and I have no reason to believe it will be otherwise.  It will all be done as part of Agenda 2000.</P>

      <P>Apart from the worrying prospect of setting rural poor against urban poor, would it have been better to approach the Commissioner for Regional Affairs prior to the matter becoming the subject of a public debate, given her comments on the radio that she was astonished the matter had not been brought to her attention before being reported in the media?  Does the Taoiseach agree that, in the battle for Objective One status, the real battle has to be fought in the area of decentralisation and regional policy?  The strongest argument we could put to the European Commission is that we have forgotten our old policies which were bad and will now embark on a proper decentralisation and regional policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of what actually happens, it is a question of where the money comes from.  If an area is not earmarked for Objective One status after 2006 it will still have to put forward its plans and proposals &mdash; as was the case with the national plan for the past ten years or so &mdash; and they will be sorted from the Exchequer.  If an area is in transition and out of the funds, that does not mean it will not receive funds; it will seek Exchequer funds or co-financing.  I would not like people to believe that because an area is not in a particular category it will not get resources.  That is not the case.  The purpose of Objective One status is to bring the areas of the Community that are underfunded up to the level of the rest of the Community.  I assume the Deputy believes that is acceptable.</P>

Does he agree that in Westport he said he would abolish <Col N="201" /> the western commission when he came to power, that this is the reason for the long delay in bringing forward the legislation and that he does not understand the dilemma of people in the west caused by the mistakes he made in the provision of Structural Funds for the region in the intervening period?</P>

      <P>Given that in the context of Objective One status it is not possible to pick out blackspots, something Members would like to see done as a means of recognising the deprivation and marginalisation throughout the island, I wish to register concern that the focus of the debate is drifting away from the critical needs of the west and the Border counties.  Is the Taoiseach advising us that the arguments against the creation of a region composed of the long neglected counties in the west and along the Border to accommodate the continuance of Objective One status are equal to or greater than the arguments for its creation?  This is a very important matter and there has been no outline or exposure of the arguments.  All we have seen in the exchange which has taken place is an effort on the part of specific interests to wind back the efforts at creating a new region to accommodate Objective One status for the west and the Border counties.  Those same influences in the House have been a party to the creation of the imbalance between the west and the Border counties and the rest of the jurisdiction over many years. Will the Taoiseach indicate if the detail of the arguments and discussion to which he and the Cabinet is exposed will be provided to all Members to allow us make an appraisal of the seriousness or otherwise of them?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision must be made in the best interests of the entire country, something I am determined to ensure.  As Deputy Ó Caoláin said, there are blackspots and areas of social exclusion in all parts of the country.  However, each of those areas cannot be sub-regionalised. The discussion, if the Commission agrees, would be on the basis that there are certain areas based on Eurostat figures which are under certain criteria for given years.  It would be up to the Exchequer to see what would be done for other areas.  I am very conscious that the Border <Col N="202" /> regions, the west and some midland regions are certainly well below the criteria in terms of the Eurostat figures and are likely to remain so.  If we can use Objective One status to the best advantage, not in transition but fully, to help those areas, the argument is worth examining in fine detail and this is what the Government has been doing for some months.  We have commenced most of our work and studies and will make a decision on the matter in due course, well in time for negotiations in Europe.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the next round of Structural Funds could help to redress regional disparities in this country?

      <P>Those of us who have worked on regional policy in the west and the Border counties for the past 25 years do not represent any sinister influence and are not interested in rolling anything back.  However, the current indicators which make the case for being below the 75 per cent level do not mean we are required to ignore that an opportunity might be lost by relying on indicators which might be inadequate for an urban region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent newspaper article, Dr. P.J. Drudy of Trinity College made a case in regard to the inadequacy of GDP as a measure of urban poverty in which he pointed to the need to consider a series of social indicators such as early school leaving, income levels and long-term unemployment. Those who see the case for the west and the Border region in a straightforward manner under the existing criteria are not required to turn their backs on the people who perhaps have the strongest case for advancing from the poverty in <Col N="203" /> which they live.  Is the work carried out by Dr. Drudy and his colleagues being considered in the construction of a set of human-based rather than spatial indicators?  Social and spatial indicators could be combined to make the case for a region of localised urban poverty.  Will the urban strategy be abandoned altogether and will the strategy change from one based on the entire country to one based on a region as suggested in the leak?  Will such a strategy be drawn up using the same indicators as heretofore?  We must know whether the previous kind of methodological work on GDP is being supplemented by recently published work which clearly makes a strong case for obdurate urban poverty in Dublin, Cork and other places.</P>

Such criteria are not applied however in regard to Objective One status for the entire country; GDP is used to determine whether the benchmark for the relevant years is above or below 75 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the report by the Director of Telecommunication Regulation published in July 1998 relating to the issuing of temporary licences for television deflector operations pending the availability of digital transmission system; her views on this report and whether the Government will give consent to the relevant regulations and licensing terms to ensure this is done; the discussions if any she has had since this publication with the regulator on the matter in order to expedite the availability of multichannel television services to many rural areas; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the report referred to by the Deputy.  The report sets out a rational, fair and forward-looking basis for the development of <Col N="205" /> digital television services in Ireland.  As regards the question of a licensing system for television deflector operations, I have not received any proposals from the director on the matter and it is therefore premature to comment on whether my consent will be given to relevant regulations.  I have met the director on a number of occasions to discuss this and other issues and I plan to have further discussions with her after I receive her proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since we went into recess, there have been two significant developments in this area, first, the publication of the director's report in which she rejects the exclusive terms of MMDS and considers that an interim licence should be granted and, second, the Government has agreed to digitalisation?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister discussed the common issue between her office and that of the regulator of introducing interim deflector transmission licences for the south coast group and many others so they can operate on a legalised basis?  The director told an Oireachtas committee that any litigation against the State is against the Minister and not her and that policy in this area, as opposed to direct licensing, is a matter for Government.  Both the Minister and the director are involved.  Is the Government in favour of introducing interim transmission licences for deflector groups?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I read the report carefully and I re-read it before I met the director. The director is independent under legislation passed by the Oireachtas in June 1996.  I reread the legislation and the debates on it in this House. The purpose of the legislation was to establish the office and the independence of the regulator.</P>
      <P>The communication from the regulator said that she was &ldquo;minded&rdquo; to provide for licensing deflector operations.  That was reaffirmed in the report which said that she was &ldquo;minded&rdquo; to discuss them.  In mid September she wrote to everybody who had been in touch with her on this issue and a copy of that communication was forwarded to me.  It states: &ldquo;The director has asked me [her private secretary] to explain that there are a number of complex issues which must be dealt with in the context of our consideration of a licensing regime for deflector systems.  These are being dealt with as quickly as possible but our best estimate is that it will be towards the end of the year before we can deal with the question of a licensing regime for deflector systems.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the regulator's position. I have had many conversations with her.  It is the policy of the Government I wish to ascertain. I am aware of the director's role with regard to licensing but is the Minister in favour of licensing deflector groups on an interim basis pre-digitalisation?  I was asked that question yesterday at the National Ploughing Championships.  Farmers wanted to know what the Government's policy is <Col N="206" /> in this regard.  The answer is simple: the Minister either favours the regulator licensing these operations or she does not.</P>

According to the report she is &ldquo;minded&rdquo; to so do. She forwards the regulations to me and, if agreed by Cabinet, they are co-signed by Etain Doyle and the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have any policy in this area or will it be her policy to support whatever proposals the regulator brings forward?  Has she, in her discussions with the regulator, given any indication of whether she has a view on this?  Many people throughout the country cannot currently watch multi-channel television, but they have a basic right to watch it.  Is it Government policy to support the regulator if and when she brings forward such regulations?  As the person with responsibility for policy in this area, will the Minister ensure that if the regulator does her bit, the Minister will do hers?</P>

The regulator is independent and it is not my job to harry or harass her.  Her letter to all relevant interests stated that the licensing regime would be decided at the end of the year.  I am not responsible if she takes longer than that because of her workload and the complex issues involved. I will not be found wanting when the regulator comes to me.

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, she has had with the Department for Finance with a view to securing finance in 1999 to introduce a radon remediation grant scheme to assist householders in undertaking radon remediation works on their dwellings; her views on whether this scheme should be introduced in view of the excellent state of public finances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I previously sought to have provision for funding made in the context of my Department's 1998 Estimates submission.  However, in light of Exchequer commitments and overall budgetary constraints, it was not possible to make provision for such a scheme this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to grant aid being provided in 1999, this is being considered in the context of the 1999 Estimates. Pending the conclusion of discussions on the Estimates and the publication of the Estimates <Col N="208" /> for 1999, I can make no commitment about the availability of funding for a radon grant scheme in 1999.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that radon gas in Irish homes is responsible for the death from lung cancer of 200 people per year, according to medical research?  Is he further aware that a minimal amount of money is required for the remediation grant scheme I set up and for which I secured funding during my term of office as Minister of State?  The scheme would have given 50 per cent remediation grants to householders, up to a maximum of £800 per house.  Will the Minister of State tell the House something more than simply claiming that the Government does not have the money?  The Government is awash with money from taxpayers and this scheme would be some return to the taxpayer where this problem arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is aware of the health hazard which exists as a result of high levels of radon.  Dr. McLoughlin of the physics department in UCD recently concluded that radon might be implicated in approximately 150 lung cancer deaths each year or 10 per cent of the total number of such deaths.  The RPII constantly emphasises this fact and its concern, and the Government is not taking its advice lightly.</P>
      <P>I aspire, as my predecessor did, to act on this issue but he, too, had difficulties with finance.  He was not in a position to pay out money despite his aspiration.  I am now in the same position. However, every effort will be made to deal with this matter in other areas and hopefully it will be possible to provide direct assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that on 24 April 1997 the Government approved a scheme of grants and the required funding for that year and subsequent years?  The grants were relatively modest but 500 houses per year could have been given the attention they required.  Is the Minister of State further aware that the cost of treating a lung cancer patient who is terminally ill is much higher than the cost of preventing that patient getting the disease in this context in the first instance?  Will he make the case again to the Department of Finance, where I was told at one time that people who needed grants should sell their television sets if they were concerned about the matter?  I won that argument with the Department and got Government approval for the grants.  Will the Minister of State go back and explain to the Department that it should be concerned about the 200 people per year who are dying of lung cancer &mdash; I certainly am &mdash; because it is costing it more to give money to the Department of Health and Children to treat people with lung cancer than it would cost to prevent them getting it in the first place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>May I continue without interruption?  A number of measures have been and are being taken to accentuate the Government's concern and awareness of the situation.  The RPII is continuing to concentrate considerable resources on the radon survey.  The institute's survey, which has dealt with 21 counties to date, will be completed early next year.  The survey's findings will continue to be published so that the public is aware of the situation.</P>
      <P>A range of Departments is dealing with this matter.  To portray the concern of the Government, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has published revised technical guideline documents related to the Consolidated National Building Regulation, 1997, which calls for radon protection measures to be taken in the building of all new houses commencing on or after 1 July 1998.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will know the Minister for Education and Science has asked the RPII to carry out a comprehensive survey on schools to ensure problems with radon are identified.  That Minister will also assist schools in carrying out remedial measures which may be necessary as a result of the RPII's findings.  There is an awareness towards which we are working.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the work the Deputy has done on this subject in the past and I appreciate his support and exhortations on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind remarks.  I assure him of my full support and encouragement in trying to get back what was lost in the last budget when the Government abolished this grant scheme.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that every county survey carried out so far has shown pockets of radon gas with a lethal limit in houses?  Is he aware that is deadly for the people living in those houses?  Is he also aware of the difficulty and danger of the multi-faceted approach proposed by the Department of Finance to dissipate the Department of Public Enterprise's energy in the matter so that everybody, but nobody, is responsible?  I urge the Minister of State not to fall into that trap.  Is he aware of the latest report &mdash; which will be in the news because various Members of the House will support their candidates in the forthcoming by-election there &mdash; that 10 per cent of houses in Cork city are estimated to have a level of radon gas that is lethal to those living in them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister of State not to take no for an answer and I urge the Minister to take similar action.  He must fight at the Cabinet table for the limited amount of money required to prevent <Col N="210" /> people being killed in their houses by radon gas. Up to 200 people per year die because of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>To reiterate, the Government is aware of the situation in Cork, which is one of the 21 counties that has been surveyed thus far. The results have been published and are in the public arena.  I hope public awareness will contribute towards raising the necessary air of urgency about this issue so that it can be comprehensively addressed.</P>

      <P>Council regulation 12/98 lays down the conditions under which road passenger carriers established in one member state may provide, on a temporary basis, certain types of national transport services in another member state.  This is known as cabotage.  The provisions of the regulation will apply from 11 June 1999.  It will be incorporated into Irish law by means of a statutory instrument early in the New Year.</P>
      <P>The Road Transport Act, 1932, as amended, is the legislative basis for the licensing of scheduled bus services in this country.  This legislation governs the provision of passenger services, aside from services provided by Bus Éireann and Bus Atha Cliath.  There is widespread acceptance that there are a number of difficulties associated with the implementation of this legislation.  It is clear that this is a complex matter to which there are no simple solutions.</P>
      <P>Substantial competition between public and private operators has been of real benefit to consumers. As outlined in my Department's statement of strategy, it is planned to carry out a review of options for the effective regulation of the bus market with a view to introducing legislation to replace the 1932 Act.  This review will focus on improving customer service, effective enforcement, fair competition and appropriate integration of services.  I expect the establishment of an independent authority to be one of the options to be considered in that review.</P>

Is he aware that, as we speak, there is a legal farce whereby on inter-city routes to and from Dublin, people are, mar dhea, operating travel clubs, but in effect it is a scheduled competitive <Col N="211" /> transport service?  There is an urgent need to comply with what is coming from Europe and to regularise what is a <i>de facto</i> situation, as well as spawning and developing local rural transport services.  Does the Minister of State agree there is a huge, inherent and deep conflict in this area whereby the Minister, as shareholder and manager of the subvention for CIE, is the same person who decides who gets licences?</P>

It will then go to Government to consider the principles before proceeding to legislation. The Deputy is right; we are dealing with antiquated legislation going back to 1932, which was put in place for reasons that are no longer applicable.  The protection of CIE was involved but that is certainly not appropriate today.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's proposal for a regulator is excellent, but it is not new.  As Deputy Yates said, this has been going on <i>ad nauseam</i> through different Administrations over the years.  Deputy Stagg will know about the complexities of the matter, having dealt with it more recently than most.  He had consultations with many people in an endeavour to move the matter forward.  While he exhorted people to make written submissions, they have not yet come in from some of the main players. There has been a tendency to stand back from this.  I agree with Deputy Yates that it is time to confront this matter and in accordance with our programme for Government, we propose to do so.</P>

      <P>The current legal situation is that the ESB requires my approval under the Electricity Supply Acts for capital expenditure on any new plant. Private sector companies, on the other hand, wishing to enter the market in competition with the ESB, require a permit from the ESB under section 37 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  The ESB is currently in a position of operating in the market and at the same time regulating the entry of competitors.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, I have been advised by the Attorney General that it is essential and urgent to arrange for the immediate establishment of an independent regulatory commission to oversee the electricity sector.  This commission will operate a licensing regime for operators wishing to generate and supply electricity.  It will also issue authorisations for the construction of generating stations.  Any proposals to construct a generating station by any party, including the ESB, will be subject to an authorisation from the commission.</P>
      <P>The Department has undertaken an extensive consultation process to date regarding implementation of the EU electricity directive in Ireland which is due by February 2000.  Proposals were published by Deputy Dukes in May 1997, a discussion forum was held in January 1998 and a further consultation document was published in May 1998.  The comments received relating to the regulatory Bill were considered when preparing the heads of the currently proposed Bill and will be further considered when preparing the next two Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a number of meetings with interested parties regarding the proposals.  These included meetings with the ESB board in April, IBEC in June, the ESB group of unions in July and August and the Small Firms Association in August.  Earlier this month I met separately with representatives of both Marathon and Viridian, two potential new entrants in the electricity market. <Col N="213" /> I will continue to meet anyone who wants to meet me.  In addition, I have recently appointed Mr. Phil Flynn, chairman of ICC Bank, to act in a special advisory capacity to me and to report on all the steps necessary with regard to the introduction of competition in the electricity market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her full reply and for confirming that I was on the ball when I tabled this question before any announcement was made.  This issue only appeared in the Government's programme a few days ago.</P>
      <P>Every time the issue of the appointment of a regulator is raised in the House there are mixed views on the responsibilities of the Minister and those of someone outside the House who is largely independent of it.  Will the Minister agree that this matter has surfaced again today in terms of the telecommunications regulator and that there will be a major debate on it in the House?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister believe she had sufficient consultations with the ESB unions because my information is that they are concerned that insufficient consultations took place, particularly in relation to agreements already in place with the ESB?  Will she take on board those concerns and ensure that further consultations take place to alleviate them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concerns about regulation.  One of the difficulties with the 1996 Bill was that the regulator was not answerable to anyone.  However, she made her case some months ago at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport.  We are preparing an amendment to that Bill so that the regulator will be answerable to someone.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General told me I would have to appoint a regulator because the ESB could not authorise the building of a station in the run up to competition.  I admire the Deputy's perspicacity in tabling this question.  I wrote to Deputy Yates and Deputy Stagg four weeks ago setting out the Government's decision.  I am sorry I did not write to Deputy Currie, but it was not that no one knew about it as it was in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>I have met the unions five or six times in recent weeks and I will meet them again on Friday.  I will meet them as often as is necessary.  I have also asked Mr. Phil Flynn to meet them and to report back to me before I meet them again.  I understand their concerns.</P>
      <P>The ESB has supplied electricity since 1927. The EU electricity directive must be implemented by 17 February 2000.  We must prepare for it by ensuring that everyone is involved and that there is a competitive environment.  I will send the Deputy any information he requires.  Is he the spokesman on electricity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important issue the Minister and her Department will deal with during her period in office.  Will the road the Minister is on, which is the same road I travelled with the last Government, lead to the Minister's authority, which is given to her by the people, being given to a quango outside this House and to the creation of a democratic deficit whereby the quango will have the power and the Minister will have no authority like a chairman of a county council?  Is she satisfied that there is no other option?  Has she looked at the possibility of changing the nature of her shareholding in the ESB so that she could retain this power and continue to be responsible and answerable to this House for the exercise of that power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not considered changing the shareholding.  The issue of a regulator or regulatory commission is coming into play because of the changing nature of semi-State companies.  The previous Government, of which the Deputy's party was a member, established the telecommunications regulator.  There was a mistake in the legislation and she is not answerable to anyone but that will be rectified.</P>
      <P>I had extensive conversations with the Attorney General about this matter and he advised me that because the ESB operates in the market, it cannot regulate those who wish to enter the market in tandem.  I hope the regulator or regulatory commission will be given responsibility for natural gas so that the entire energy market will be regulated by one individual or body.  The Bill includes a stipulation that the person or persons appointed to regulate the market will be answerable and accountable to a Dáil committee.</P>
      <P>There is a need to develop one, two or perhaps more power stations by a certain date and the ESB is anxious to proceed before time runs out. Possible new entrants to the market are also anxious to get their operations up and running. However, under the current legislation, we cannot grant authorisations.  The Attorney General has a proper function and his advice to me was that it is imperative that this legislation proceed.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West):</i> Are the Minister and the Government, under cover of competition and the need to appoint regulators, in reality preparing the way for the privatisation of the electricity supply industry or substantial portions of it?

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the way the so-called privatisation in the UK was carried out was not correct.  According to newspaper reports the privatisation process created fat cats, less service to consumers and a diminishing water supply.  I understand a similar situation obtains with regard to the electricity supply industry in the UK.  From my knowledge of the British experience &mdash; which is based on newspaper reports &mdash; the privatisation which occurred in the 1980s was carried out on purely ideological grounds because of a determination that everything in sight should be privatised overnight.  I do not hold to that point of view and I do not intend to change my position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the primary indication of the management of the ESB in respect of this issue, that the question of stranded capacity and the public service obligations will lead to the imposition of a levy on new generators?  Will the legislation include provisions to deal with such levies, thereby levelling the playing pitch in respect of all generators?  The ESB is concerned that a piecemeal approach will leave it in an unfair position.  The company wants to compete.  Will the issue of a levy in lieu of milled peat, or stranded capacity be catered for in the legislation or will they be dealt with in an <i>ad hoc</i>, piecemeal way?</P>

      <P>The least we should do before proceeding to the Order of Business is complete our deliberations on the five priority questions.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for the House to decide whether questions should be lumped together.  At the end of a discussion on a particular question &mdash; we have spent 15 minutes dealing with question No. 70 &mdash; in order to facilitate Deputies, I lump together the final supplementaries.  Members are aware that four to five supplementaries have already been asked which were not lumped together.  If Members wish the Minister to conclude, I will ask her to do so.  However, if Deputies Enright and Stagg wish to ask supplementary questions I will allow them to do so.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister took the Attorney General's advice and that she intends to continue to do so.  The Minister stated earlier that the regulator will be accountable to a Dáil committee, a development with which I agree.  However, what safeguards if any will be retained in the Minister's Department when the regulator is appointed?  The Minister is responsible for the energy sector.  Many people would be happier if the Government had the final say in the distribution of electricity in the event of difficulties arising in future.  I presume this will extend to all aspects of the energy sector in the long term.</P>
      <P>Upon the appointment of the regulator there will be tight restrictions on the Government's involvement with semi-State bodies.  As the Minister is aware, the ESB is the principal purchaser of peat from Bord na Móna.  When does she envisage the remaining £10 million will be paid to Bord na Móna to allow it to compete on a level playing field?</P>

What changes would be necessary for her or her office to become the regulator or for the regulator to be accountable to them rather than to a committee of the House which would only meet the regulator annually?  What changes would be necessary for the Minister to retain the power to have the regulator report to him or her so that he or she would subsequently be available at all times to answer questions in the House?</P>

      <P>Deputy Enright asked about the power of the regulator.  The Bill will provide that he or she will report to an Oireachtas committee.  The money due to Bord na Móna is a separate matter. However, I would be glad to reply to the Deputy on that matter.</P>

      <P>Given the Government's welcoming of the announcement by the Dublin Transportation Initiative that it will revise its proposals for dealing with the traffic chaos in the Dublin region and the explicit commitment given by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that extra moneys will be made available for quality bus corridors and extra coaches for CIÉ and the DART, will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Estimates will be published early in order to indicate that these moneys will be made available or will we have to wait until 2 December before the allocation of an extra £26 million will be confirmed?</P>

      <P>Hopefully, the Estimates will be debated according to the normal rota if there is additional money.  Much of the DTO short-term action plan covers issues which are already in the Estimates, particularly increased capacity of the Dublin Bus service; additional rolling stock; accelerating the implementation of the original 11 quality bus corridors; the cycle route <Col N="221" /> network, 100 kilometres of which is to be put in place over the next two years; implementation of the parking strategy announced yesterday; the provision of park and ride facilities and improved traffic and road space management.  The DTO is commencing a fundamental reappraisal of the DTI strategy which is due for completion.  I will check with the Deputy what items should be included in a Supplementary Estimate, but many of them are included in the three year Estimate period.</P>

He said during the debate on the Bill relating to the television coverage of major sporting events, which was introduced in Private Members' Time, that a broadcasting Bill would be forthcoming which would deal with that matter. <Col N="229" /> The broadcasting Bill has been promised for this year but the issue of the television coverage of major sporting events has been put off until 1999.

Given that contracts with private predatory agencies, such as Sky Television, will be signed before the end of this year, why has the Bill been deferred until 1999?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided that the television coverage of major sporting events should be dealt with in a separate Bill.  The legislation will also transpose Article 3A of the EU directive which is designed to ensure that coverage of major sporting events is open to television.  The Bill may also include provisions to implement other parts of the directive.  It was decided to keep it separate from the broadcasting legislation but it is relatively short, containing approximately ten heads of a Bill.  It is a question of the time available because already 20 Bills are due to be taken during this session.  The Minister has prioritised the broadcasting Bill and it will be taken during this session.  The heads of the Housing (Gaeltacht) (Amendment) Bill are being drafted and will probably be ready for submission to the Government next month but it will be early next year before the Bill is published.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 33:</P>
    <P>In page 10, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(l) to provide an education system&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) directed towards the goal that every student (having regard to his or her needs and abilities) is best equipped for full inclusion in the social, economic and cultural life of the nation, and (ii) aimed at countering inherited educational disadvantage.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;Deputy O'Shea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to another part of the debate on 3 July because it is fundamentally relevant to this debate.  I moved amendment No. 33 which states:</P>
      <P>.special educational needs means the educational needs (a) of students who have a disability or a learning difficulty, (b) of exceptionally able students, and (c) of students who, by reason of social or economic circumstances or familial dysfunction, are liable to experience educational disadvantage</P>
      <P>During the debate, the Minister for Education and Science said:</P>
      <P>There is a danger that if I accepted Deputy O'Shea's amendment, the focus would be diluted and consequently the provision in terms of resources for special needs children.  If the special education review committee which was established ten years ago had adopted that formula we would not have witnessed such a degree of improvement in relation to special needs children.</P>
      <P>On foot of that statement the Minister appears to misunderstand or be unaware of the following extract from page 18 of the report of the special education review committee published in October 1993 which sets out the rationale underlying the report.  It states:</P>
      <P>In this report the description &ldquo;pupils with special education needs&rdquo; is used to include all those whose disabilities and/or circumstances prevent or hinder them from benefiting adequately from the education which is normally provided for pupils of the same age and for whom the education which can generally be provided in the ordinary classroom is not sufficiently challenging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the introduction to the report, on pages 19 and 20, the review committee proposes the following seven principles which should serve as basic guidelines for the future development of the system. <Col N="236" /> The first principle states that all children, including those with special educational needs, have a right to an appropriate education.  The committee was in agreement with the principles put forward in part 13 of the primary school teachers' handbook which states that each child deserves to be provided with the kind and variety of opportunities which will enable him or her to develop natural powers at his or her own rate to the fullest capacity.</P>
    <P>The second principle states that the needs of the individual child should be the paramount consideration when decisions are being made on the provision of special education for that child.</P>
    <P>The third principle states that the parents of a child with special education needs are entitled to, and should be enabled to play, an active part in the decision making process.  Their wishes should be taken into consideration when recommendations on special educational provision are being made.</P>
    <P>The fourth principle states that a continuum of services should be provided for children with special educational needs, ranging from full time education in ordinary classes, with additional supports as may be necessary, to full time education in special schools.</P>
    <P>The fifth principle states that except where individual circumstances make this impracticable, appropriate education for all children with special educational needs should be provided in ordinary schools.</P>
    <P>The sixth principle states that only in the most exceptional circumstances should it be necessary for a child to live away from home to avail of an appropriate education.</P>
    <P>The seventh principle provides that the State should provide adequate resources to ensure children with special education needs can have an education appropriate to those needs.</P>
    <P>The review committee recommended that due account be taken of the principles in framing an Education Act.  The House should note that the definition used by the review committee included disadvantage as well as the other issues, such as disability. What the Minister said here did not reflect that.</P>
    <P>It should be further noted that one of the recommendations for general education arrangements regarding the lack of local education administrative structures is that, following consultation with interested parties, the Government should establish local education administrative structures without delay throughout the country and these should have responsibility for co-ordinating services to students with disabilities and special needs in their areas.  This recommendation has fallen on deaf ears as far as this Minister is concerned.  He has steadfastly and stubbornly refused to countenance any devolution of functions to either local or regional education authorities comprising the partners in education.</P>
    <P>Looking at where the legislation has gone so far, the Minister unintentionally gave us a misleading steer during the debate.  Special education <Col N="237" /> needs for the purposes of the Bill are defined in its interpretation section as the education needs of students with a disability and of exceptionally able students.  That excludes others who have other circumstances giving rise to their special needs.  The legislation is all over the place.  The amendment I seek to add will strengthen the Bill and get it back in line with what was proposed by the review group on special education.  I complimented the Minister on the fact that he has been open and receptive to other amendments. However, this legislation is flawed and it is the basic flaw which presents the major difficulty for the Labour Party.  The Bill is not about partnership in any real sense.  Neither does it single out disadvantage for particular attention, an area singled out by the special review group.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister wishes to admit it, there is a steadily worsening situation in schools.  It manifests itself in many ways, not least of which is deteriorating discipline.  There are children in schools who are making no progress and are making it difficult for teachers to provide the level of education they wish.  The resources provided for the education system are not applied as effectively as they could be.  There is a major problem in the system in that schools and teachers are not stating publicly the problems they have in their schools, usually for very good reasons.  If schools say they have major discipline problems, that they have students with whom they cannot cope and that it is having a devastating effect, parents will lose confidence in the schools.  If other schools with similar problems do not go public, they are at an advantage.  One of the major difficulties with the Bill is that it still promotes competition between schools in the numbers game.  That is something that is neither healthy nor good.  If the regional or local structures sought in the previous Education Bill by the then Minister for Education were in place, there would be a more regulated situation for schools.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment. He should remember that, while the Celtic tiger helps many people, there is a growing number of people who are outside its scope.  This first manifests itself in the education system.  This progresses to anti-social behaviour visited on the community, causing a huge reduction in the quality of life for many people.  One of the objectives of the Bill is to identify people who have inherited educational disadvantage.  We know of children who come from families where unemployment has been a feature for a number of generations. Families such as this may be clustered in some areas but they are spread throughout the country.  Research has repeatedly shown that, where there is little experience of education in a family and no high or reasonable level of ambition, especially as regards the mother's ambition, children find it extremely difficult to make progress.  I am seeking, in the context of the section outlining the objectives of the Bill, a full, clear and comprehensive announcement of the State's recognition of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The Minister also must perform a further task, which is to put the Bill back into Committee Stage on the interpretation section and tidy up the ineffective and inappropriate definition of special education needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of engaging in another Second Stage or Committee Stage debate.  We have discussed these issues at great length.  I reject the contentions advanced by Deputy O'Shea about the Bill and have no intention of going into them in detail.  The definition we have used in respect of special needs is much more advanced and comprehensive than that used in the Education (No. 1) Bill.  In terms of disadvantage, we have put forward a comprehensive proposal relating to the establishment of a committee on disadvantage, which was not in the original Bill.  On all fronts, this Bill is a vast improvement on the original introduced by the Labour Party when it was last in power.</P>
      <P>My reading of amendment No. 33 is that it is merely a restatement of what is already in the Bill, so I do not propose to accept it.  I refer the Deputy to Section 7 paragraph (a), which refers to a level and a quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of students. There are provisions throughout the Bill guaranteeing equality of treatment and so forth.  I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>What Deputy O'Shea is attempting to do with the amendment is admirable. He underlines one of the objectives of an education system: to achieve inclusiveness and ensure disadvantage is countered in every possible way.  It is surprising that although there is a reference to promoting equality of access, the objects of the Bill are light on this subject.  On Committee Stage I noted that the Minister intended to come back on Report Stage to include a term in some of the other objects of the Bill which would seek to accommodate the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Shea and other Members when this amendment was moved. Something has happened between Committee and Report Stages to persuade the Minister not to go ahead with what he seemed to indicate on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea is underlining an area of the education system which has been overlooked and has not had the priority it deserves within the Department of Education and Science.  I am not pointing a finger at any particular Minister.  This amendment attempts to include this neglected issue in the objects of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I complimented the Minister on the way he was prepared to take on board some of the concerns and needs of everyday living.  We want this Bill to cover all aspects of education.  We are not defining special educational needs as those of students with disabilities or exceptionally able students.  They are not the only groups in the education system.  We need legislation to ensure that all parties in education; teachers, boards of management and parents deal with disadvantage which is of major concern.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this point on Second and Committee Stages.  The Deputy knows that I was speaking in the context of progress made in special needs education on meeting the pupil-teacher ratios in a whole range of special needs categories identified in the report.  I stated that we would not have made such progress if the focus did not remain on this objective.  There is much more to be done on special needs. However, if we broaden the canvas too much pupil-teacher ratios would not have been improved to the same extent for children with specific needs in categories such as mild or severe autism.  We need to do more.  There is a danger of losing focus if we include educational disadvantage in this mix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want to make progress on special needs we should keep a narrow focus with a view to pupil-teacher ratios, staffing schedules, physical accommodation, equipment and so on.  That is the point I made on Committee Stage and I stand by <Col N="240" /> it.  The Special Education Review Committee gave an impetus to this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister considers that his contribution has some meaning. However, it has no meaning for me.  The definition of special needs as per that committee included the phrase &ldquo;circumstances that prevent or hinder them&rdquo;.  Special needs did not only refer to gifted children or those with disabilities, it was children who had educational difficulties for environmental reasons.  This is the case, whatever the Minister may say.  He has introduced a Bill which goes against the ethos of the report.  I accept that he made his remarks in a particular context and that he thought what he was saying was accurate. However, it was not accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not accurate.  The Minster has made a mess of the Bill by including this definition in the interpretation section.  It is incumbent on him to tidy this up.  He knows that indiscipline among children from dysfunctional families is a problem faced by teachers.  We must address the needs of these children.  These are the Objects of the Bill.  The Minister has a set of objects and he is stubbornly refusing to include any substantial, meaningful or inclusive reference to disadvantage.  This is a disgraceful attitude to this important legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems so hell bent on getting this legislation through quickly that he does not wish to upset anyone.  However, in so doing he is missing an opportunity to address the real problems in education, some of which have not surfaced.  An enormous discipline problem in schools is being ignored.  We can set up pilot projects but this issue has to be substantially addressed.  A signal must be sent to parents, teachers and the public.  Older people who are the victims of the same dysfunctional children also need a signal from the Minister that he is serious about this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister was smiling smugly at some of the contributions made in this debate.  This is serious business and he should apply himself to the fundamental problems in education.  We can all clap ourselves on the back and say we are great that we have put legislation through. This party is not accepting a situation where the less well off in society, the disadvantaged and many others who need to be defined within that special needs definition are being ignored by the Government.</P>

      <P>We come to amendment No. 34, amendment No. 35 is an alternative and amendment No. 36 is related.  I suggest that <Col N="241" /> amendments Nos. 34 to 36, inclusive, be discussed together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 21, after &ldquo;needs,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;support services and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The aim of amendment No. 34 is to place on the Minister an obligation to ensure that there is made available to every person in the State not only an appropriate education but also support services.  There is no question but that this was implicit in the Bill as originally drafted.  However, I am happy to make it quite clear through this amendment in response to concerns raised on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 35 proposed by Deputy Bruton has the same effect.  I am satisfied that Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 36 is not necessary.  The Minister's duty to provide support services is clarified by amendment No. 34. References to accommodation appear in sections 2 and 33 and in my amendments Nos. 18 and 114, discussed earlier.  The Minister has already a duty under section 7 to plan and co-ordinate services. It is not necessary, therefore, to restate these commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has agreed, in his amendment No. 34 which is an alternative formulation of my amendment No. 35, to add support services.  Increasingly support services of a type which are not strictly educational are very important to the full participation of pupils, particularly those with special needs, in education.  Some of those will come from outside the mainstream education providers.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 36 is deemed by the Minister to be unnecessary.  In my experience, which is not as vast as that of Minister, the issue of suitable accommodation within a school is a real issue and not one that would normally be embraced by appropriate support services.  If the school in question does not have appropriate facilities &mdash; rooms which allow special needs to be catered for &mdash; regardless of what staffing, capitation, remedial or other supports are offered, it cannot deliver effectively.  I and many outside the House believe it is important to include a reference to suitable accommodation in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue addressed in this amendment refers to bodies outside the education system.  In allowing a child to participate fully in a school the Minister may take responsibility for delivering support services which fall within his remit, such as remedial teaching or a care assistant, but other authorities play a significant role in providing support services which are equally important for the successful participation of a child with special needs.  That is why, on the prompting of those outside the House who have a particular knowledge and interest in this area, I included the provision that the Minister should ensure, where necessary, the co-ordination of other bodies in the provision of such support services.  People <Col N="242" /> genuinely feel they may fall between two stools, that the health board and the school authorities may not be working together to provide the range of support services necessary.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced by the Minister's reply, nor was I able to follow the references he made to some other amendments but I will endeavor to check those amendments.  I am not convinced that amendment No. 36 is redundant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 7 the Minister already has a responsibility to co-ordinate support services.  In sections 2 and 33 we have already inserted references to include accommodation. I accept the Deputy's point on the need for co-ordination between local bodies, particularly health boards, the Department and schools.  I question whether we could impose an obligation on one Minister and one agency to ensure co-ordination with others.  Co-ordination and co-operation are two way processes.  What is important is that systems are put in place and that clear lines of duty and budget lines are laid out to prevent difficulties arising in the special needs area.  I have direct experience of this in terms of language therapists.  Those difficulties have been resolved in a number of cases in the past months but obviously new cases will emerge.  Whether we should legislate to do that is another point.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(g) use the resources provided to the school from monies provided by the Oireachtas to make reasonable provision and accommodation for students with a disability or other special educational needs, including, where necessary, alteration of buildings and provision of appropriate equipment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>In supporting amendment No. 36 in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton I refer to the point I made on an earlier amendment that this is the statement of the objectives of the Act. I put it to the Minister that this is where all the objectives should be stated.  That we have to trawl up and down for references shows how sloppy the legislation is whereas it could all be included in this section.  The statement of the objectives in the Bill should be clear, unequivocal and unambiguous. On the real definition of special needs within schools, there is a need&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its mismanagement of the current crisis in farming and calls on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;provide adequate shipping infrastructure to transport the maximum number of weanlings to the Continent;</P>
      <P>&mdash;introduce a fodder scheme that will address the shortage and cost of inadequate winter feed supplies on many Irish farms;</P>
      <P>pay double headage to hill sheep farmers;</P>
      <P>extend the family income supplement to farmers and the self employed;</P>
      <P>reduce the retention period for suckler cows;</P>
      <P>instigate an immediate inquiry into the collapse in pig prices;</P>
      <P>pay all grants and subsidies due to farmers as set out under the farmers' charter of rights;</P>
      <P>increase the resources of An Bord Bia to get new markets abroad for Irish farm products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of the Government to the current <Col N="244" /> crisis in farming is alarming but predictable.  It has no intention whatever of helping farming in a meaningful way through one of the worst crises in the past 25 years.  In essence the problem is that the Government does not see the agricultural sector as going anywhere.  For obvious reasons the sector is not performing as well as other sectors. This is a good news Government.  It wants to be associated only with that which attracts good publicity and to airbrush agriculture off the agenda.</P>
    <P>A rescue package of £10 million pounds was announced yesterday and today.  The seven million cattle in Ireland have been devalued by £100 per head, a figure accepted by everybody.  If this happened on the Stock Exchange it would be closed for a week.  It means that £700 million has been wiped off the value of stock held by farmers while the Minister is giving them £10 million.</P>
    <P>The Government's analysis of and subsequent feeble reaction to the crisis is alarming in the extreme for farmers.  The Government should have no trouble evaluating and analysing the current problems.  In the context of fodder scarcity we are all aware that it started raining in mid-June and, by and large, has not stopped since apart from a two week period.  Every farmer, Teagasc adviser and Department of Agriculture and Food official who called to farms during those three months could see there were horrendous problems on the ground.  They saw areas where there was no growth, where silage could not be cut in some cases and realised, above all else, that there was going to be a greatly reduced amount of winter fodder on farms.  Due to market forces, a bale of silage which cost £10 last year costs £20 this year while the cost of hay and straw has similarly increased.</P>
    <P>Farmers who found their grassland was poached had two options, namely, to bring in cattle two or three months earlier than usual and feed them a limited supply of fodder or sell them on the market.  I know there are problems facing agriculture for which the Minister for Agriculture and Food or any other Minister cannot and should not be blamed.  The Minister has no control over the weather or the turmoil in the Russian market.  However, he should have been able to manage the crisis which he saw unfolding three months ago.  If he did not see the developing crisis then he is not doing his job.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters which are worth putting to the Minister.  Two months ago it was as clear as day for the reasons I have outlined that farmers would have to sell cattle several months in advance of the normal timetable.  There was a racket going on about the non-availability of shipping space to the Continent for weanlings. The Minister said we exported more weanlings this year than last year, but that does not matter a fiddler's damn if the price farmers receive for weanlings at marts is much lower than this time last year.  On my travels around the country to marts over the past two months I met exporters with contracts for 1,000 cattle in various continental <Col N="245" /> countries, but who could not buy any because they had no shipping space.  I blame the Minister in large measure for this situation.  It is a physical problem which we should have been able to overcome but about which the Government did nothing.</P>
    <P>In case anybody thinks I am overplaying the problem, I was at the mart in Ennis, in Deputy Daly's constituency, last week and saw the nicest heifer weanlings weighing 298kg being sold for £220.  This is daylight robbery.  The man selling them was going nowhere as there were no grants available and no market for them.</P>
    <P>Everywhere I go farmers say they know there are huge problems in agriculture but that the Minister is not trying his best.  I understand this was said directly to the Minister this morning at the ploughing championships.  Neither the Government nor the Minister are trying their best, something I put down to the fact that the Minister did not understand the depth of the problem as it unfolded.  Alternatively, the Government and the Taoiseach have decided to allow farmers hit the bottom, that they are not important.  I find it difficult to understand how the Government can turn its back on old friends. Around the country Government backbenchers are being told that Fianna Fáil is letting down people for whom the party meant so much over the years.</P>
    <P>The £10 million package will fall very short of the losses incurred.  I could not find out from the Department exactly how the £10 million will be distributed &mdash; I hope the Minister will outline this in his speech.  For example, will small dairy farmers in areas of severe handicap or with very wet lands be excluded?  A top up of £2.5 million has been announced for hill sheep farmers who need everything that is going.  However, only a double headage payment is of any use to them.  Unless the Minister tells us otherwise, I understand there is a proposal to pay £6 per ewe in some areas &mdash; it has not yet been decided where.  Hill farmers bringing their sheep to the mart are less concerned about how much they will get for them than whether they can sell them at all.  Such sheep are almost unsaleable, particularly wethered lambs.  Animals which were selling for £17, £20 and £22 last year are selling for £2, £3 and £4 today.  The land used for sheep farming cannot be used for any other purpose, leaving the farmers with no income.  There is no way of providing them with an income unless headage is doubled as I have proposed.</P>
    <P>In the EU context I am sure the Minister did his best to get export refunds increased last week. Last Friday, before the announcement was made, most factories were paying 78p.  On Monday morning with immediate effect the factories knew there was an extra four or five pence per pound which did not exist on Friday and which should have been paid from Monday.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, the factories have not yet moved on that.  There is something very wrong with such a cartel arrangement.  What must one <Col N="246" /> do to ensure that funding from Brussels passes directly to farmers who are selling cattle for £150 per head less than usual?  The Minister should insist this money is passed on as the current situation is scandalous.</P>
    <P>We have outlined a number of measures in this motion which, if enacted, would ensure that farmers get through the winter.  I have referred to the lack of available transport to the Continent.  A basic principle of EU membership is that there is free movement of goods and services throughout the Union.  If we produced computer products for which there were ready markets in the EU but were unable to transport the products to that market, civil war would break out.  We must be allowed to sell our products and we must do whatever it takes to get those products to the markets.  It is time that dawned on the Government.</P>
    <P>The £2.75 million proposal in regard to the hill sheep farmers was put in place by the previous Government.  The Minister is not therefore seeking an increase in the headage payments, rather he is seeking permission from Brussels to pay them at the same level as last year.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was implemented for people working in the PAYE sector.  I agree with the principle behind this payment which means that eligible participants who want to work and give of their skills and talents to the community can hold down badly paid jobs and have their income supplemented through FIS.  For a couple with three children, the cut-off point for FIS is £252 per week.  People earning less than that amount are entitled to apply for an FIS payment.  What about the self-employed and farmers?  Why are they being discriminated against?  A couple with three children may be working very hard on the family farm but may be unable to make £252 per week because of external pressures.  Many of them would not even make half that amount.  Why will the Government not announce the immediate extension of the payment to farming families?  The Taoiseach is reported as having said such a move would cost £70 million.  I checked the figure with the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and was told it could cost as little as £30 million. The £30 million figure speaks volumes about the thousands of farming families living on the poverty line.  Why is the Government running away from this issue?  During the term of office of the previous Government, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family, chaired by Deputy McGrath, adopted that proposal.  I recall the Minister's colleague, Deputy Mary Wallace, making an impassioned plea at that stage that farmers should be included.  I hope she will revisit her comments now as this issue is of vital importance.</P>
    <P>The retention period on the suckler cow scheme should be shortened.  It is doubtful many farmers would accept the current prices.  I accept the Minister's comments in regard to the Libyan trade and hope it will serve to improve the situation although I am not aware of many cattle being <Col N="247" /> bought for that purpose.  However, if the Minister says the ship is sailing next week, I believe him.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for pig farmers. Will the Minister, as a sign of goodwill to the industry, abolish the £1.05 slaughter levy?  I received phone calls from farmers in Cavan and Donegal today who sell approximately 150 pigs per annum, which is low even by national standards. It would be wonderful if they could save £150 per year and it is within the Minister's power to enable that.  In terms of intervention and aids to private storage, the facility which was obtained does not appear to be working.  It is bad enough for pig producers in the south of the country but those in Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Meath are receiving £5 or £6 less per pig.  Most pig producers are losing £18 per head per pig and they will simply not be able to survive at those levels.</P>
    <P>I notice the headage payments are beginning to be paid and as far as the charter of rights is concerned, that is in order.  However, it is not sufficient to say that &lsquo;x&rsquo; amount of headage will be paid on time.  There is an income crisis in Irish agriculture at the moment with a shortage of cash coming into farming households.  Farmers do not know where the next payment will come from. They have children to support at primary, secondary and third level and must buy clothes, shoes and pay university fees like everyone else. There is intense bitterness among farmers at the moment as they feel the Government is not doing enough for them.</P>
    <P>The financial resources of An Bord Bia should be greatly expanded.  We will only get out of the current mess by getting into markets in Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and ambassadors, salesmen, Ministers and the Taoiseach must do all they can to ensure that Irish animals are sold in these and other markets.</P>
    <P>This Government comprises three different factions: Fianna Fáil, the majority party, the Progressive Democrats, for whom agriculture has never been anything other than a joke, and the Independents.  The Independents are a special button on the trousers of the Government &mdash; they are keeping them up.  I am calling on the Independents to do in this House what they are telling local radio and newspapers they want to do for the farmers.</P>

      <P>It is important that when one is in Government one takes responsibility for what is going on.  During the BSE crisis, prices were not as low as they are now and it was an international crisis.  Fianna Fáil constantly spoke about what the then Minister, Deputy Yates, should and should not do.  Now, when matters are not nearly as bad, they are making a hames of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong squadron in support of Deputy Connaughton's motion, which I also strongly support.  I recall listening to the Minister when he was a Minister of State and launched a £600 million beef programme with Mr. Larry Goodman and the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  It seems he has lost his passion, commitment and understanding of the way he used to operate.</P>
      <P>There is deep despair among farming families. They believe the Minister for Agriculture and Food does not appreciate how great that depth of feeling is.  If he did, it would be some consolation and help to them.  Deputy Connaughton has pointed out on more than one occasion how serious this problem is.  Children of farmers attending third level have tramped the streets of this city looking for accommodation and have lost an entire quarter because they cannot get some-where to live.  The Minister's refusal to extend the family income supplement to thousands of these families speaks for itself in terms of the Government's commitment and the Minister's ability to convince the Government.</P>
      <P>At the World Trade Organisation talks in Singapore, which I attended as Minister for Tourism and Trade in the previous Government, it was obvious that agriculture will be on the agenda of the next ministerial meeting in Geneva in 1999. There is an extremely strong lobby building up in South America, Australia and New Zealand to abolish all subsidies and premia.  Statistics are being correllated by the ILO and the WTO.  The Minister is aware of the significance of this and what it means in terms of Agenda 2000.  I hope he will be strong enough to resist it when the time comes.  There is a great deal of politics being played internationally, with visits by Irish Ministers to Iran and Libya.  The Libyan Government and people are suited to import the beef we raise here and I hope that ship sails next week.  I agree with marketing the base quality product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It takes a while to change the structure of an enterprise.  However, the world population is rising and there are countries inside and outside Europe which can take more of our product.  It requires a huge investment in marketing to convince <Col N="249" /> them that Irish product is of world class quality and is suitable to their needs.</P>
    <P>As regards headage payments, there is no point in giving a person two breakfasts in one morning. This is the farmers' due and they are entitled to it under the charter of farmers' rights.  This is a bluff.  They are entitled to payment and the system should be streamlined enough to cater for that.  I agree that the best return on farming enterprise income is in the dairy area.  What is being done about the national quota and the consequences for young farmers entering the business?</P>
    <P>The retention period for suckler cows should be changed.  If one has to keep them from 1 June to 1 September, they have to be fed.  If they could be culled and removed from the system, it would lessen the burden.  Perhaps the Minister will do something about this.  He should do something about the movement of heifers within the 30 days blood test period.  This is causing a restriction on heifers blood tested for brucellosis who cannot be moved in that 30 day period without being tested again.</P>
    <P>This motion is strong and has the support of all Fine Gael Members.  It can be seen from the numbers here that they mean business.  The Minister is the leader of the political farming voice and I expect him to try his utmost to convince his colleagues that they have done too little too late and that they will have to do more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on the role he is playing in this grave issue.  It is obvious there is no vision for agriculture at the moment.  The constraints are well recognised &mdash; the decline in the amount of land and farmers needed to produce food, the ageing farm structure in the west, the extent of non-viable farms and the difficult economies of scale which prevail.</P>
      <P>A typical constraint in terms of farm viability is that there is 40 to 50 per cent reduced milk yield per square mile in the west.  Serving in a rural constituency, I am aware of the huge role of farming families in local towns.  The estimated £70 million cost of giving FIS to farmers clearly indicates the gravity of the problem.  This is based on filling the 60 per cent gap.  Teagasc have found that 25 per cent of all farms are non-viable, there is no off-farm income and a huge number of families have dependent children.</P>
      <P>It is grossly unfair that the income baseline for families with three dependent children is £272.  It is a grave injustice that farmers are excluded from FIS.  Something is dramatically wrong if a family with sales of £16,800, expenses of £11,000 and a net income of £5,200, which is only £100 per week, is not entitled to FIS.  I ask the Government to look at this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area of concern is dairy hygiene.  The production of milk and dairy products obliges dairy farmers to undertake costly on-farm investments, for which grants are not available.  As regards farm investment, there is still a great need for investment grants and farm improvement programmes <Col N="250" /> to improve efficiency, help modernisation and increase profitability.</P>
    <P>Farming is a spent force and is occupational therapy for a huge number of people.  Deputy Connaughton and I went to Ballymote mart, where the despair could be seen in the rings. People were giving away weanlings for £200.  I met an exporter who said that he could have exported 1,000 during peak trading, if he had the boats.  This problem should have been dealt with before now.  It is too late.  This is the busiest time for marts and people are giving stock away.  There has been no support for farmers during the weather crisis.  I ask the Minister to give double subsidies at the very least.</P>
    <P>The Government should look at the FIS as a compensation measure.  Its current operation discriminates against those on farming income.  They are not looking for dole.  Family income supplement is widely promoted by farming organisations as a means of helping farmers at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Connaughton on bringing this important and timely motion before the House.  The work of the Minister and this Government over the past 15 months can be summed up in three words: failure, failure and failure.</P>
      <P>The first failure was when the Minister failed to get adequate support from the Cabinet to realistically confront the problems in agriculture.  This was forcefully brought home to everybody today when the Government Chief Whip said in Wexford that he did not realise there was a crisis in agriculture.  How could the Minister hope to gain support in such a Government?  I challenge him to face down the people who think solely in urban terms and to demand realistic compensation for farmers in this crisis.</P>
      <P>Never before have all sectors of agriculture been in crisis at the same time.  This time last year cattle were selling for an average of £75 more than they are today.  Ewes were selling for £20 more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Lambs are selling for £12 less per head than they were last year.  Deputy Healy-Rae, who is at present hiding behind the column in this Chamber, must speak out now for the hill sheep farmers who cannot give away their lambs. He must prove to the House and to farmers that he is concerned about them by voting for this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The second failure by the Minister was his failure to go to Europe and adequately highlight the crisis.  That was proven when Deputy Connaughton and Deputy John Bruton went to meet the Agriculture Commissioner who told them he did not know there was a crisis in Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's third failure was his inability to <Col N="251" /> bring forward a realistic policy to show young farmers that they have a future in agriculture.  He failed to initiate a single policy which might show that the Government has a commitment to agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a failure on all fronts.  If I were still pursuing my previous occupation and marking the Minister on performance, I would give him an NG &mdash; no grade &mdash; for his activities in the past 15 months.  However, even if the Minister failed to extract adequate finance from Government, he can still take action without incurring extra financial commitments.  He can extend the 30 day limit to alleviate the marketing problems in marts in the west of Ireland.  It should be extended to 60 days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Tuesday week at the sheep market in Abergavenny in Wales a group of farmers walked out in disgust after watching sheep being sold for 25p each.  They were so dismayed they chose to give their flocks to the RSPCA rather than sell them.  This might be difficult to comprehend but it did happen and, while one cannot blame the Minister for it, it should alert him to the fact that unless radical steps are taken this crisis might be the beginning of the end of the agricultural economy as we know it in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Farming is undergoing an unprecedented crisis, as was pointed out to the Minister in the Dáil debate on this subject last May.  At that time the Minister outlined certain measures he intended to take but nothing has happened to date.  The wider community appears to be oblivious to the crisis or dismisses it.  The Minister has a responsibility to articulate the situation to the general public and outline what measures he proposes to take. If the problem is not addressed, there will be wide-ranging knock-on effects which will impact adversely on rural schools, businesses and the rural way of life.</P>
      <P>During this debate the Minister will hear many complaints and tales of woe.  They are well founded and merely reflect the message that has been coming from farmers, particularly during the last few months.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidStanton" hpid="Mr. Stanton Mr. Stanton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stanton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should consider declaring a national emergency in agriculture.  I have never seen anything like the current crisis. Recently I went to the mart in Midleton and there were more people there than cattle.  Confidence was gone and cattle were being taken away without any bids being made for them.  That is the situation in a relatively wealthy part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are in despair.  These are real people who are in real trouble and who need real help. I, too, call on the Independent Deputies for action.  The country needs Deputy Healy-Rae, Deputy Fox and Deputy Blaney to show some bottle at this time.  Deputy Healy-Rae made an inspired maiden speech last year in the Dáil during <Col N="252" /> which he told the House that he is the champion of the small man and the small farmer.  Now is his time; he must speak now.  He will not bring down the Government but he might secure action for people who are in trouble and need help.</P>
    <P>It is 12 months since the Minister abolished installation aid.  In the intervening time he repeatedly promised it would be reintroduced.  Deputy Fox, annoyed and angry, told the House that she was putting down a marker for the Government to ensure it is reintroduced.</P>
    <P>Another crisis has been created solely by the Government.  According to Macra na Feirme, only 12 per cent of farmers are under 35 years of age.  That is an extraordinarily serious issue. Young people have no confidence in farming. Whatever small incentive existed to attract them into agriculture was abolished when the Minister, only a few weeks after promising otherwise during the election campaign, abolished installation aid.  A year later, during which there were repeated false promises, there is still no sign of its reintroduction.</P>
    <P>This crisis goes beyond politics.  The Minister and the Government must get their act together for the sake of the country.  The announcement of the Government's aid package was timed to take place during the National Ploughing Championships in Wexford and just before the Dáil resumed, probably in the hope of defusing this debate.</P>
    <P>That tactic has not worked.  Farmers are still angry.  Their anger was obvious when they demonstrated in front of the Department of Agriculture and Food a few weeks ago.  Their anger was accompanied by despair.  At the time I wondered why they had been so quiet but they explained that they had been negotiating in a responsible manner with the Department for a long time.  The negotiations were going nowhere so they had to take to the streets.  They did not want to do that but they had no choice.  It was the only way to attract the Government's attention.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the country and its largest industry, let us work together.  To date, the Minister has been a failure and I do not say that lightly since he is a fellow Corkman.  I feel sorry for him. He has been led like a lamb to the slaughter.  For the past year he has said he is depending on the Minister for Finance to allocate money to agriculture. The Minister for Finance did not do that and when he did it was too little and too late.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to fight back.  If he does, he will have the support of all sides of the House.  He must be seen and heard now.  People are facing an extremely bleak winter and some small farm families will go hungry because of the inaction of the Minister and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to defend the Government's and my own record in that regard. Recently, I announced a series of measures to assist farmers with their cash flow.  Such measures include the speeding up of direct payments to <Col N="254" /> farmers.  Of course, farmers are entitled to direct payments.  They are compensatory payments and are available to them.  I negotiated the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which makes those payments available to farmers.  They are their due entitlement but speeding them up is helpful in cash flow terms.  Farmers are getting paid cattle and sheep headage payments this year one month earlier than ever.  That is an effort to be of assistance.  If anybody here or outside wants to slow them down for any particular reason we can arrange that as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We also negotiated an increase in the advance of suckler cow and special beef premium payments.  As everybody knows, that advance is paid at 60 per cent but we have reached agreement from Brussels to pay it at 80 per cent.  The reason is to bring forward £45 million extra for farmers before the end of October this year.  Normally, they would have had to wait until next spring to get the extra £45 million.</P>
      <P>There will be more rapid payment of REPS where such payments fall due.  There will be a payment of the outstanding top-up of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October.  We have arranged at an early stage for Teagasc to hold special free advisory clinics on fodder in the areas affected and to do a survey of the worst affected areas.</P>
      <P>Another measure is the promotion of live exports and re-opening the trade to Libya.  That trade was closed down for a number of years.  I thank my Government colleagues for their assistance to me in re-opening that trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>An agreement was signed on 25 July 1998 by the Department of Foreign Affairs and a high level delegation from Libya.  That agreement has since been endorsed by the administration in Libya and we are told by the main shippers that they will be shipping from 10 October 1998.  I expect shippers and cattle buyers to be bidding in the marts &mdash; the sooner the better, as far as I am concerned &mdash; in time for those ships to begin sailing to Libya on 10 October for the first time in several years.</P>
      <P>I put a lot of work into ensuring that appropriate transport facilities are available for live exports.  I want to return to that issue later because it has been raised.</P>
      <P>Each of these areas was identified as an important issue in discussions with the main farming organisations I have met with on a consistent basis over recent months, including July, the holiday month of August, and September. Further action is, of course, necessary.  Despite all</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="255" /> I have said, I accept that significant hardship will be experienced on many farms in the areas most adversely affected by weather conditions.  I do not need to labour the point on the weather situation this summer.  In the peaty and heavy clay areas of certain counties, the capability of farmers to make adequate silage and hay was greatly reduced.  While the situation improved significantly in many areas, but not all, in August and while the two week dry spell in September was very important for getting an extra cut of silage &mdash; and in the middle and northern part of the country it was important to tidy up the harvest &mdash; fodder difficulties exist in a number of areas.  In addition, farms in such areas have had great difficulty in allowing animals to graze and in getting machinery on to farms.  Many animals have been brought indoors to be fed, which further exacerbates the problem of winter fodder, some of which has already been eaten.  I acknowledge those difficulties.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that the Government responded yesterday by making £10 million available to deal with fodder difficulties being experienced by farmers in some locations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only lucky dip money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of the new scheme will be finalised very quickly because we want to get it focused and targeted on the people who need it most.  We want to get money into the pockets of farmers so they can buy additional fodder.  This is a fodder scheme.</P>
      <P>We had weather difficulties in the 1970s when I remember that a fodder scheme was organised through a voucher system.  It was practically use-less and it was fiddled in voucher scams.  As regards this scheme, I have asked officials at a senior level in the Department to draw up a scheme to target individual farmers in the worst affected areas, as highlighted by the Teagasc report.  In that way, those who most need help will be able to buy fodder with that money.</P>
      <P>I am also seeking the approval of the European Commission to continue the sheep headage top-up of £2.75 million.  I agree with Deputy Connaughton that this was there for the last couple of years, but it was not a permanent thing. Because of the difficult situation this year I have asked the European Commission to continue with that scheme.  I will, however, be looking for additional measures.</P>
      <P>At this stage I would like to consider the overall picture for farm income in 1998, looking at each of the main sectors briefly.  This year we have the difficulty that it is not just confined to certain sectors.  In 1974 we had difficulty with calves that were thrown away for half nothing, but it was confined to one sector.  This year the difficulties affect cattle, sheep and pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until July 1998 the outlook for the beef sector was positive with supplies running well ahead of 1997.  The beef problem, however, was created by <Col N="256" /> the difficulty in Russia, which occurred in mid August, only a number of weeks ago.  Because of the amount of beef they took from Ireland &mdash; some 70,000 tonnes or the equivalent of over 200,000 head of cattle &mdash; it created enormous problems for us.</P>
    <P>The position relating to the milk sector is much more positive.  Prices have been very good for the first seven months of the year and are well ahead of 1997.  Those milk producers who are not affected by weather conditions have, for the last ten or 15 years, had a positive income.</P>
    <P>The outlook for output value in the pig sectors is very disappointing.  Pig farmers had good years in 1995, 1996 and 1997, but this year is extremely difficult with very low prices.</P>
    <P>The outlook for output value in the cereals sector is one of little change and more or less the same as last year.</P>
    <P>Direct income payments now account for 48 per cent of income arising in agriculture.  These payments play a significant role in supporting farm incomes and will do so again in 1998.  This is a point which is forgotten when comparisons are made in regard to previous difficulties in agriculture. In previous times we did not have 48 per cent of income made up from direct payments. The fact that I have secured the European Commission's agreement to advance the payment of 80 per cent of the suckler cow and special beef premia in 1998 will provide a significant boost to cash flow in October this year, whereas normally farmers would have to wait until next spring.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that this week I have had to defend the level of payments arising from adverse comments in the German magazine, <i>Der Spiegel.</i>  Members have heard that on radio and television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I defended those payments totally because I negotiated them.  They are worth a significant amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation on the beef market stems from the loss of the Russian market.  I have made the very strongest representations to Europe, including Commissioner Fischler whom I met in Austria last week and in Brussels this week.  I impressed upon him the need for immediate and urgent action.  The difficulties in Russia were on the agenda of the Council of Ministers this week.  The measures I identified as being necessary included a substantial increase in export refunds which were, in fact, granted; the introduction of an EU-sponsored export credit guarantee scheme; a widening of the intervention system and an increase in cattle premia from 60 to 80 per cent. I am pleased my efforts have borne fruit and that a variety of measures are now in place which <Col N="257" /> should help to bring about an improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>Our exposure to the Russian economic difficulties is easy to understand.  In 1997 we exported 70,000 tonnes of beef to Russia and similar levels were expected this year.  Russia took 40 per cent of EU beef exports in 1997.  Beef previously destined for Russia is now being diverted back to the European market.  However, a further difficulty, which we did not have during the BSE crisis, is that there are 580,000 tonnes of beef in intervention. In 1996 the intervention stores were clear.  This creates an extremely difficult problem for us.  The recovery in beef consumption was assisted by An Bord Bia over the past couple of years.  We have now recovered a substantial amount of the consumption which we lost as a result of the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>I am confident the following measures should help to alleviate the situation for our producers. The European Commission at the beef management committee last Friday increased export refunds by the equivalent of 5p per pound.  I asked factories to pass that on.  The first quotes were on Monday morning but the 5p was not passed on.  My predecessor had similar difficulties with the same factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister condemned him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall he referred the matter to the National Prices Commission, but it was not able to do anything about it.  It is regrettable that a number of those factories are owned and controlled by farmers.  Co-operatives control a substantial amount of our beef processing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on them to pass on the full benefit of the 5p export refund to the beef producers because they and the economy need it.</P>
      <P>I made a request to the Commission for an export guarantee scheme to be introduced specifically to deal with the Russian situation.  This would provide EU exporters with the necessary confidence to resume trading with Russia pending the restoration of normality on the Russian market.  We are anxious to ensure that any measure taken does not undermine the commercial trading infrastructure which has been built up over several years and which will be vital once the Russian market returns to normal.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to put pressure on the Commission to put more effective and flexible intervention support arrangements in place to help stabilise the market.  We must get back into the Russian market and we must have a more effective intervention system.  I made it clear at the Council of Ministers meeting that we do not want intervention beef released into a market which is already depressed, as that would depress it even further.  Another problem is that there are 580,000 tonnes of beef in intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> The Commission's policy on the sale of intervention beef will have major implications for the recovery of our former trading profile with Russia. The decision last week to sell 10,000 tonnes of intervention stock at relatively low prices will not help with this recovery.  I objected strongly to that and asked that an ultra-cautious approach be taken to the release of any of that beef for intervention.</P>
    <P>We have made progress in a number of markets and I am confident and optimistic about making further progress next week in the Iranian market.  We had difficulties in the Iranian market over the past couple of years because of political and diplomatic problems.  All European countries withdrew diplomatic representation, but that is now improving.  I will meet my Iranian counterpart next week as well as other senior Ministers of the Iranian Government.  High level diplomatic contact involving my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs is ongoing with Iran and it is my intention to make every effort to reopen the market as soon as possible.  The Iranians had serious concerns about BSE which led to the closure of the market since 1996.  I hope to discuss these concerns in detail with them during the course of my visit next week.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that BSE levels have increased this month just before my visit to Iran.</P>

      <P>The media seem to be gloating at the &ldquo;alarming increases&rdquo; in BSE levels, although there has been a decline of 11 cases over the year as a whole.  If there had been a lower number of cases during September, I doubt if it would have merited any comment in the media.</P>
      <P>I am pleased I was involved in reopening the Libyan trade.  The Government, especially the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was exceptionally helpful in this regard.</P>
      <P>The availability of shipping services to transport cattle and other livestock to export markets is a critical factor.  However, we must be clear about the facts.  We have two commercial operators of roll-on/roll-off ferries, Pandoro and Irish Ferries.  They carry livestock to the Continent and this service is being augmented by the carriage of large numbers of animals on dedicated vessels.  So far this year we have exported 83,000 head of cattle to the Continent.  This is four times the number of cattle exported in 1997.</P>

      <P>Cattle exports to the EU so far this year are already almost on a par with what we exported in 1995, which was an all-time record. Anyone who read the <i>Farming Independent</i> yesterday will know that one of our national farm <Col N="259" /> leaders commented on the fact that we were exporting too many weanlings and calves. Between 4,000 and 6,000 head of cattle a week have been exported to the Continent in recent weeks and I believe exports will continue at that level.  On that basis I am confident that 1998 will see the highest level of cattle exports to the EU in four years.  These figures and the log sheets speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>There are also difficulties in the pigmeat sector.  Oversupply of pigmeat in the EU, increased production, static consumption and difficult export markets have combined to make the EU 108 per cent self-sufficient in pigmeat.  On the home front, the fire last June at a pig processing plant in Northern Ireland has added to the problem for certain producers from the South who were supplying it.  Approximately 5,000 pigs per week went to the plant.</P>

That has helped in reducing the overhang.  Some weeks ago I also requested the Commission to introduce an aids to private storage scheme to support the pigmeat market.  The Commission agreed to do this and with effect from Monday last an attractive scheme has been in operation. It will provide EU funding for storage of 70,000 <Col N="260" /> tonnes of pigmeat destined for third countries for a period of up to six months prior to export.</P>

To deal with this, the Department, the IFA and the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors put arrangements in place for Saturday slaughterings.  That has improved the situation considerably.  To assist pig producers I have also put a proposal to the EU Commission for an adjustment in the veterinary inspection fee to reflect the price payable to producers at a particular time in the pig cycle.  That is currently with the EU for approval and I expect that approval to be granted in the coming days.</P>

      <P>This has been a mixed year in terms of sheepmeat. Following a request I made to the EU Commission for assistance, a scheme of aids for private storage was introduced which helped to alleviate this difficult market situation.  There followed a period of several months during the summer when lamb prices were at record levels and reached as much as 12 per cent above last year's level.  However, since mid-August the situation has changed and we are again faced with a depressed market.  I accept that people are practically giving away animals at some marts.</P>

      <P>I visited Spain which, in addition to Portugal and Italy, is an important market for Ireland.  However, the Spanish are now exporting sheep and lambs because of the growth in their herd numbers.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties faced by hill sheep producers and I have asked Bord Bia to do everything possible to resolve the situation.  I am aware that Bord Bia is engaged in an intensive promotion of sheepmeat and, as already stated, I recently visited Spain to progress matters in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to address the market problem in a targeted way, I have taken steps to encourage the live export of sheep.  The <i>Holstein Express</i> was cleared to carry live lambs some time ago and a second vessel, which sails to France, is currently undergoing inspection and it will be approved in the next few days.  I am also hopeful that the live trade of light mountain lamb to southern Europe will give a boost to the sector and I am doing <Col N="261" /> everything in my power &mdash; including visiting the area &mdash; to assist in that regard.</P>
    <P>The issue of direct payments was raised earlier. I reiterate that farmers are entitled to such payments and I make no apology to anyone &mdash; including the author of the article on this matter which recently appeared in <i>Der Spiegel</i>&mdash; in that regard.  I make clear my intention to make payments available earlier this year in view of the problems which have arisen.  Already £146 million has been paid to farmers under the 1998 headage and premium schemes.  This compares with 116 million paid out at the same time last year under the 1997 schemes and it is in stark contrast to the position in 1996 when only £74 million had been paid out on 30 September of that year.  Payment of sheep headage commenced this year on 21 September &mdash; ahead of the commencement date in 1997 &mdash; and, to date, over £12 million has been paid to sheep farmers.  Payment of cattle headage commenced on 26 September &mdash; a month ahead of the commencement date in 1997 &mdash; and over £47 million has been paid to date.  Effectively, approximately £60 million has already been paid under the 1998 disadvantaged areas schemes. This compares with just over £13 million which had been paid on 30 September 1996.  Early payment is designed to provide assistance in resolving this problem.</P>

It would require the introduction of a further regulation to change the retention period.  Given the way regulations are drafted, it would take a considerable period to bring about change.  Effectively, any agreement on changing the retention period would not be obtained in time to benefit a reasonable number of producers this year.  I am confident that the fodder scheme I intend to introduce will be of assistance to farmers in that regard.</P>

      <P>Since its establishment in December 1994, Bord Bia has been committed to promoting, assisting and developing the marketing of Irish food and livestock in a professional manner.  Over £12.5 million has been allocated from Exchequer and EU funds to give a total budget of over £18.3 million to Bord Bia for its activities in 1998.  That is a considerable improvement on past allocations and if there is any way I can make further moneys available to Bord Bia I will be glad to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House is unfair and unbalanced and it does not take account of the action that has been taken since current difficulties &mdash; the Russian situation did not manifest itself <Col N="262" /> until mid-August &mdash; arose.  On a number of fronts, the Government has taken effective action to support the industry through the introduction of a range of measures including increasing export refunds; putting transport facilities in place for live exports; reopening the Libyan market; accelerating payments to farmers; increasing advance payments; providing advisory support and actively promoting our products on export markets.</P>
    <P>I commend my amendment to the House.  I call on the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to use the remainder of the time available to make his contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to welcome this important measure which is aimed at assisting farmers in this time of difficulty.  The Government has responded swiftly and strongly to the needs of farmers and I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, on the action he has taken.  I am aware that he has used every available opportunity to assist in this process.  This was confirmed at a recent parliamentary party meeting when representatives of the IFA acknowledged the fact that Deputy Walsh is on the ball in respect of negotiations with Commissioner Fischler.</P>
      <P>We have put together a package amounting to an additional £13 million which will be targeted at those most affected by the combination of market difficulties and a grave winter fodder situation. This, combined with bringing forward headage payments and the range of measures announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, will make a significant difference on the ground.  In preparing this package we consulted widely with farmers and their organisations.  It was made clear to us that an urgent injection of cash was needed which would allow people to hold on to cattle or to buy fodder, as the case may be.  That is what we have provided.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe that when people have an opportunity to consider the details of the package of measures being put in place they will agree that the action being taken is appropriate.  Frank Allen of the ICMSA appearing on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; acknowledged that.</P>

      <P>As a Government, we must consider income support for farm families in the context of trends in farmers' income.  There have been dramatic changes in farming since the 1960s, particularly following our entry to the EU.  The modernisation of agriculture during that period has played a major role in creating our booming economy and society.  Farm families must share equally in this boom.  There has been a dramatic <Col N="263" /> shift in the source of farmers' income during the period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly speaking, half of farmers' income comes from off-farm sources and half of the remainder comes from direct income support.</P>
      <P>One of the results of recent changes is that there are enormous differences between various categories of farmers.  Some have done very well from farming, some see farming as an add-on to their off-farm activity, but there are others who are not faring as well.  Low income farmers contribute significantly to rural disadvantage.  The Government is addressing this problem in a number of ways including the establishment of the Western Development Commission and drawing up a White Paper on rural development.</P>
      <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises that farming is the cornerstone of the Irish economy and will remain so into the next century.  We are committed to supporting farm families to achieve an equitable distribution of support payments.  All Departments, including mine, have a role to play in this regard.  My Department's role relates primarily to addressing the needs of farmers on low income.  We are currently spending £33 million on what is, in effect, a rural income supplement, namely, smallholder's assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Over 7,000 people, many with families, benefit under this scheme.  There are many other safety net payments including pre-retirement allowance and old age pension.  These payments have an important role to play in ensuring a safety net for farmers.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the Department of Agriculture and Food, the following measures will be taken to increase the effectiveness of this scheme.  Farmers already on the scheme will be encouraged to come forward for reassessment of their means.  My Department will intensify its information campaign at local level to increase awareness of the scheme and to emphasise its applicability to farmers.  In conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food, the means assessment procedure will be reviewed to ensure that it takes full account of recent trends in farm incomes.  However, we must look at the long-term situation and consider the policy options in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency which operates under the aegis of my Department is currently undertaking a review of farm income support policy in the context of targeting resources at low level households.  This review is due for completion by the end of the year and I will carefully <Col N="264" /> examine it with a view to informing policy options for low income farmers.</P>
    <P>FIS for farmers is not a solution to the short-term problem.  This ought to be self-evident to anyone who takes time to consider the real problems facing farmers.  Farmers are looking for an immediate response.  A weekly payment along these lines, if it were to be introduced, would not meet the needs expressed to us.  The extension of FIS to farmers would, of course, raise wider issues.  It raises the question of the extension of FIS to the self-employed generally and other groups, such as CE workers.</P>

      <P>This would massively increase the cost of the scheme, much of which would not benefit farmers.  A range of practical measures are associated with such a policy proposal, including issues of take up, incentives to develop farm income and equitable treatment of income from different sources.</P>
      <P>With regard to the likely costs of extending FIS to the self-employed, there seems to be some confusion. With the agreement of the House I wish to extend my time briefly to explain this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The last costings were prepared four years ago and suggest that the likely additional cost would amount to £30 million per annum.  These figures are subject to limitations and circumstances have changed considerably since.  For instance, as a result of budget changes introduced by me to the scheme, it is now calculated on a gross rather than net income basis. Obviously, that would increase the figure of £30 million.  I confirm that work is under way on preparing revised estimates and preliminary figures. They indicate that the cost of FIS would be considerably higher than the 1994 estimate and perhaps would be as high as £80 million.  It is not good enough to devise policy proposals on the basis of outdated figures.  We have asked that these be updated and are trying to develop a much more cost effective and targeted approach to this crisis.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies opposite led by Deputy Bruton have unashamedly jumped on the FIS bandwagon. Deputy Bruton is now in Opposition.  He did not bring in FIS for farmers when he was in Government last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to say there are not passions in this debate.  However, the debate is of crucial importance in the context of the recent disasters experienced in the agricultural sector. While a widespread consensus that there is a crisis in farming is shared in urban Ireland, it is deeper than the current fodder shortages and the disastrous prices for cattle and pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It simply cannot be isolated from what is proposed in Agenda 2000 and CAP reform.  Only now people are beginning to realise and wake up to the fact that the CAP reform of 1992 &mdash; the <Col N="266" /> MacSharry proposals &mdash; simply failed to meet their objectives.  During the negotiations on CAP the European Commission set out a number of objectives.  It set out to increase competition to allow farmers to take advantage of world market developments, improve food safety and quality and provide alternative incomes in jobs for farm families.  CAP reform failed on most of these points.</P>
    <P>It failed to provide food at affordable prices for consumers and maintain the maximum number of farm families on the land in Ireland.  Not only do 5,000 farmers leave the industry annually, but the young people coming behind them are not interested in farming as a career.  I experienced this at first hand when I met an IFA delegation in north Tipperary in July.  Parents are worried about the future of the family farm, which in many cases they spent years assembling.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is not seen as a career choice but as a career of last resort by many young people. Who could blame them for leaving farm life in search of a more prosperous career in urban centres?  The current prices for cattle, pigs and sheep could not sustain young families, particularly in areas where holdings are small and the land is disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it is the fault of any Government.  This is a much bigger and deeper crisis.  Shouting at each other and scoring points will not solve the problem.  That is why I respect the expertise of Deputy Penrose, who has helped to educate me about the scale of the crisis in a way I never understood.</P>
      <P>The current crisis has for too long been narrowly focused, evidence of which has been seen during this debate.  Successive Agriculture Ministers have acted as firefighters in their portfolios. There is a distinct absence of a rural policy which would ensure the sustainability of farms and the families who depend on them.  The Government, Opposition parties and the farm lobby must change tack.  There is a need to concentrate on long-term policy instead of firefighting and to look at where the problems exist.</P>
      <P>We should be clear about who is suffering most during these current difficulties.  Inevitably they will be weathered by the larger farmers who for the past ten years have experienced modest increases in their incomes and have been able to invest in farm expansion and upgrading. However, there are pockets throughout the country where rural poverty is an issue.  Some farm families will simply be wiped out within the decade unless we have a rural policy which is targeted at sustaining them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out in a recently launched study by the Roscommon Smallholders Action Group that the higher income farm households benefited more from the current direct payments system and in 1996 only 15 per cent of direct payments <Col N="267" /> went to those households earning less than £5,000.  This area is in need of radical reform. Those on the lowest incomes should benefit most from direct payments but current policy mitigates against this.</P>
    <P>I wish to criticise the manner in which the Government has attempted to put forward a rush policy on regionalism in an effort to secure maximum funding under the next round of Structural and Cohesion Funds.  The Government's so-called subsidy shopping approach to regionalism could damage our chances of procuring decent funding.  My party is in favour of a policy of genuine regionalism based on subsidiarity, democracy and socio-economic equality.  The concept of regionalism must be based on a bottom up approach and at its core should be the plight of small rural farm families whose existence is threatened every day.  Agriculture is still our most important indigenous industry.  The type of policy which we put forward over the coming years will determine whether farms sustain families or we develop into a nation where farms become large empires for a select few.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion and to set the record straight for the Government Chief Whip who seems to be of a different view to the rest of the country and thinks there is not a major crisis in farming.  I hope that does not indicate that he and his colleagues are out of touch with reality.  I was shocked by what he said, but I know the Minister, Deputy Walsh, is not out of touch with reality.  There is a crisis in agriculture and even though the Minister announced a rescue fodder package yesterday, it will only skim the surface in terms of resolving it.  It is welcome, but it has been brought to my notice that there will be problems in implementing it.  Some people believe they will be excluded from the benefits. That is why it is critical it is targeted at those in need.</P>
      <P>I would like to tell our European counterparts that primary agriculture is three times more important in Ireland than in the EU generally.  It and the food industry remain the bedrock of our rural economy.  The agri-food sector is also an important part of our economy accounting for 14.2 per cent of GDP, 13.5 per cent of employment or 175,000 jobs and more than 13 per cent of our exports.  I put those facts before the House to refute the recently published articles which reported we were getting more than our fair share of subsidies.  The beef production sector, which I know a good deal about coming from the midlands, generates between 3 per cent and 4 per cent of our national wealth.  The corresponding figure in the EU is only 0.3 per cent or 0.4 per cent.  In other words, the beef sector is ten times more important to our economy than to the average EU economy.  That relates only to the production sector and takes no account of processing and other related industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I congratulate the Minister who fought hard to get beef export refunds increased last week.  That was supposed to give farmers an increase of 5p per pound in the price of beef, but that is not the case.  I have said before in this House that someone is snapping up price increases.  When my party was in Government I asked if a cartel was operating.  It is difficult to prove it, but there is no doubt about that now.  How is there a coincidental fall in prices?  Surely one person can sell beef better than another person.  That is the nature of competition.  Why did all beef prices suddenly fall to 78p per pound?  Why is someone not offering 80p or 81p per pound for beef?  It is time the Competition Authority was asked to examine this matter.  The increase in export refunds that was hard won last week has not been passed on to producers at the farm gate.  That is part of the problem.  It is no use winning battles if wars are being lost elsewhere.  The Labour Party will support the Minister in whatever measures are needed to ensure that all the hard won concessions are reflected nationally at farm gate level.</P>
    <P>We know where the problem lies.  Since June cattle prices have fallen by 50 per cent, the lowest in 25 years and lower than during the BSE crisis a few years ago.  The price decrease is largely attributable to the crisis in the Russian market and until recently our inability to gain access to the key Middle Eastern markets.  The pig industry is in crisis and it is on the receiving end of the downturn in the world economy.  Turbulence in the Asian markets has had major implications for our pig exporters and, consequently, for our pig producers.  A farmer involved in pig production to weanling stage told me it takes up to £30 to produce a pig to weanling stage, but he is lucky to get £18 for it.  That makes matters very difficult for pig producers.  A prominent beef farmer in the midlands told me today that it costs 90p a pound to produce beef to finishing, but farmers are getting only 78p a pound for beef.  That return is unsustainable.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems in this area.  One is the absence of competition, which I hope will be rectified by the reopening of live exports to Libya and other Third World markets.  We are facing an era when the sheds housing winter fatteners will be empty.  A prominent midland farmer who used to take in 600 store cattle annually took in only 160 cattle in 1998.  That farmer employs a few men and their jobs are under threat and, more importantly in relation to competition, that farmer will be absent from the livestock mart ring.  That farmer is as critical as any live exporter, but he is on his way out of farming. That point has been lost in this House.  There should be no ambiguity or equivocation about that. The midlands, which is the home of winter fattening, is being decimated.  I could bring the Minister down to those farmers.  Some Deputies might not like to admit it, but 60 per cent of my votes come from farmers and many of them have a good deal more than ten acres.  I am reflecting their concerns tonight. Those farmers have told me in no uncertain terms that we have let them down.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> A recent editorial in <i>The Dry Stock Farmer</i> by Pat Lawlor stated that rural politicians had better wake up because the face of rural Ireland is changing.  Farming will be decimated and the traditional farming practised will be no more. Sheds will be closed and there will be a switch to factory farming similar to that in vogue in other European countries.  That is not what I, my constituents or the Labour Party want.  I am proud the Leader of the Labour Party is present tonight to reflect our concerns about this.  I want to send a message to the farming organisations.  We invited some of their representatives to meet us to discuss the problems facing their members as far back as January, but we did not get the courtesy of a reply.  We will not be treated as second class citizens in relation to this debate.  We are the oldest party in this State and are here to reflect farmers' concerns.  If farm leaders want to discuss anything with us we are ready and willing to play our part to ensure the survival of rural Ireland, which is very dear to my heart.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, does not know what is happening, I had better tell him. One hundred farmers are leaving the land every week.  As my party leader said, one of the objectives of the MacSharry proposals was the maintenance of the maximum number of farming families on the land, but that statistic reveals we have failed abysmally to meet that objective.  I am not blaming Governments or anyone else in that regard.  The Minister said that £1 billion is available in income supports, subsidies and premiums, but is it right that 70 per cent of those supports go to 30 per cent of farmers while the remaining 70 per cent of farmers receive only 30 per cent of the supports?  Does that constitute equity and is it effective?  It is time we examined our method of allocating resources.  We have an obligation to ensure that resources are used efficiently and effectively and are properly targeted.  We are abrogating and standing back from our duty in that regard.  We must change the system to ensure that farmers who have been excluded, such as heifer farmers who do not receive a penny in supports, are catered for.  There is a proposal to reduce suckler cow quotas by 9 per cent when we need a quota to cover another 250,000 suckler cows.  We must address the problems in those areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reopening of exports to Libya which should bring down the curtain on the BSE saga which had a massive negative impact on our beef sector.  That market has the capacity to take up to 200,000 cattle in a full year.  We will support the Minister in his efforts to secure markets in other Third World countries.</P>
    <P>It is important to highlight the issues affecting the economic and social fabric of rural communities and to identify approaches to overcome disadvantage.  I do not wish to attack the Minister personally but I have a problem with the number of commitments that were given.  I do not give undiluted <Col N="270" /> commitments to anybody because they come back to haunt one.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reintroduce the installation aid scheme.  This would be a psychological fillip for young farmers and the farming community in general.  It costs only £5,600, which is 50 per cent less than the cost of an IDA job. Between 6,000 and 7,000 young farmers are awaiting the reintroduction of the scheme.  I received a representation at 11 p.m. last night from a distraught father in north Westmeath, an area which is suffering huge depopulation.  He is a widower and has a reasonably sized farm.  He has three sons to which he wanted to transfer the farm and, thankfully, all three decided to take the option.  However, despite the fact that all the duties involved were paid, the family received a letter last week stating that their application for installation aid was too late.  It cost the farmer £16,000 to transfer his farm to his three sons, all of whom completed courses in agriculture, and they have been denied the princely sum of £16,800 between them.</P>
    <P>Although some editorials in the farming media do not agree, the suspension of the scheme for young farmers sent a negative signal to farmers. The Minister indicated that the scheme would be reintroduced and, although I do not like criticising him on a personal basis, it is to his shame that this has not happened.</P>
    <P>The control of farm pollution scheme is critical. It is expensive and I understand why it was suspended. However, it is a critical scheme not only from the point of view of participation, but also for environmental protection and to facilitate the entry of farmers to REPS.  It is estimated that the Minister's current inaction in relation to the reintroduction of this scheme is preventing up to 30,000 farmers participating in REPS due to inadequate farm pollution control facilities.  If the average annual payment to farmers is approximately £4,000, this means a loss of £120 million of which 75 per cent perhaps could be recouped from the EU.</P>
    <P>This problem is one of a number of factors which have caused the current difficulties.  The Minister cannot be held accountable for the weather or the position in Russia.  It is wrong for politicians to cast around blame like snuff at a wake.  The Minister can only do his best, but there are a number of internal matters which he must address.  If that was done, it would give a psychological boost to the farming industry and young farmers.  An industry without youth will wither and die.  In 1973 there were 275,000 farmers.  The number has reduced to 150,000 and it is predicted that by 2010 there will be only 60,000 farmers. This is the scenario facing us and, if it happens, there will be remote control farmers and a reversion to the old tradition of landlords which our forefathers fought against.  That would be a terrible indictment of our inaction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this <Col N="271" /> important motion.  In common with many of my colleagues from rural areas, over the summer recess I witnessed the terrible misery facing the farming community, particularly in my constituency of South Kerry.  Since May the prevailing weather conditions have mitigated against every element of farming activity.  One only needs to look outside the door today to understand what I mean.</P>
      <P>I wish to dispel the prevailing myth that farmers are only interested in handouts and grants and do not want to enhance their incomes through improved farm practices.  The farming community I represent is not interested in income maximisation through grants and subsidies.  The people involved are concerned about farms becoming profitable so that their sons and daughters will be encouraged to remain on the family farm.  This is the aim towards which agricultural policy should strive.</P>
      <P>The atrocious weather conditions throughout the summer have created a major problem for the small farmers in my constituency, the west and elsewhere.  Small farmers struggle at the best of times to make ends meet, even when the weather is kind to them.  The heavy rainfall over the past months has made their position untenable.  Animals survived on poor grazing pastures during the summer.  I met a farmer at a public meeting two weeks ago who told me his animals had been inside since June.  That is unbelievable.</P>
      <P>Farmers are facing an uncertain winter and action must be taken now to avert disaster.  I ask the Minister to give an assurance that animals will not die during the winter for want of sufficient fodder.  While I accept the package announced by the Minister yesterday will go some way towards alleviating the current crisis, I still have great fears about from where the fodder will come.</P>
      <P>The banks have a crucial role to play and there are two courses of action they must take to assist small farmers during this crisis.  Everybody has heard the banks say that they wish to become partners in farming.  They now have the chance to prove their commitment to this worthy aim.  The banks should provide cheap loan facilities to small farmers.  Farmers who have been affected by the bad weather conditions should be offered special short-term loans that will cover them from October until April next year.  These loans should be provided at 2 per cent less than the current standard lending rate at a minimum and access to the loans should be provided as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to exert pressure on financial institutions to show understanding over the coming months to farmers who may have difficulty meeting existing payments.  The message must be loud and clear: we do not want farmers put to the wall by banks due to small arrears on loans caused by this unprecedented crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmers I represent in my constituency operate family farms.  They are not factory farms. The Taoiseach admitted today that it would cost <Col N="272" /> £50 million to allocate family income supplement to farmers experiencing a huge drop in income. He therefore admitted that there is a shortfall in rural incomes of £50 million.  I hope my Dáil colleagues from South Kerry and all rural Deputies will show solidarity on this motion.  It involves the future of our most important industry.  For small and hill sheep farmers and their families, who are the backbone of the country, opposition to the motion would be a smack in the face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate.  The crisis in agriculture is real and extensive.  In the past I was occasionally critical of farming organisations for the way they represented their case.  However, I now agree with them on two points: first, that the position is extremely grave and, second, that the Government's response is inadequate and shortsighted.  Farmers in my constituency of County Wicklow are directly affected by this crisis.  During my time in office I listened with interest to constituency colleagues who are now on the Government side, including Deputy Fox, who promoted the interests of farmers.  They have an opportunity this evening to speak out on this important matter and I hope they will do so.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised by Members on all sides that the situation is grave, particularly regarding the dramatic fall in cattle and beef prices and the collapse of the Russian market, given Ireland's huge dependence on it.  The scale of losses is unsustainable and can only be addressed at EU level.  It is important that the EU, as Russia's closest neighbour, deals effectively with the result of events there.</P>
      <P>The current position raises issues which extend beyond the immediate problems.  It raises questions about the balance required between rural and urban development and the correlation between rural drift and uncontrolled urbanisation, the effects of which we are experiencing at present in relation to house prices and traffic chaos.  Rural Resettlement Ireland has shown the way.  We need to learn from the models adopted by it and others.  When in the Department of the Environment and Local Government I was surprised by how enthusiastically a minor measure on housing in rural areas was received.  It showed how important low cost measures can be in relation to rural development.</P>
      <P>In the past ten years 70,000 people have left the land.  In other EU countries vanishing rural populations and deserted villages are also a matter of concern.  Confidence in the current system of agricultural supports and their effectiveness is at an all time low.  Fluctuations in price reflect a boom or bust agriculture which does not benefit small farmers or the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A better analysis of the future of agriculture is required to deal with structural problems.  It must be recognised that it is not possible to turn the clock back in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It must be recognised also that there are important issues which have to be addressed to ensure the future of one of our prime industries. <Col N="273" /> While I welcome the motion, I have reservations about the proposal to introduce family income supplement for farmers.  I understand a Dáil committee is reviewing this proposal and it must be given time to reach conclusions, but it would be difficult administratively to use the family income supplement in this way.  Given the cyclical nature of farm incomes, it would be impossible to apportion it fairly or correctly.</P>
    <P>It is recognised, and has been stated by people more expert than I in this field, that the Minister is not responsible for a combination of global factors or the weather, but he is obliged to deal effectively with the issues which have arisen and in a far-reaching way as opposed to a knee-jerk response.  It is obvious to everybody that such thinking has been missing when it comes to making decisions, that the Minister has failed to deal with the crisis and that the Independent Deputies who hold such sway over the Government have failed to exert their influence in the interests of those whom they purport to represent.</P>

      <P>The number of speakers is evidence of my party's commitment to agriculture and addressing the issues confronting the farming community.  Last June on the Adjournment I highlighted the particular difficulties facing pig producers in light of the fire at the Lovell and Christmas plant in Ballymoney, County Antrim. Pig production is a major segment of the industry in County Cavan.  I have often highlighted the need to ensure pig production is not confined to large scale units.  We must protect the small pig producing units.  The future of the pigmeat sector would be well served by small and large scale producers.</P>
      <P>There is inadequate slaughtering capacity.  This means there is a lack of competition.  It is particularly important that additional slaughtering capacity is provided in the Border region.  McCarren's and Company, bacon curers, which had traded successfully in Cavan since 1860, providing worthwhile employment for generations of families, closed in early l996.  Its skilled employees processed products to the highest standard.  The industrial relations difficulties at the plant have now been resolved.  The Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, and their officials have been involved in intensive negotiations to ensure it is reopened as quickly as possible.  I urge them, Bord Bia, the farming organisations and every other interested party to redouble their efforts to ensure the necessary competition is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the summer the Minister introduced a number of measures to address the serious difficulties facing the farming community, but more needs to be done.  I hope it will be possible to <Col N="274" /> tackle effectively the fodder problems which are particularly acute in west Cavan.</P>
    <P>Deputy Penrose rightly stated that it is the view of the farming community that they are not being offered proper prices by the factories.  It would be better if the Competition Authority devoted its energies to ensuring there is a correlation between the price the primary producer is paid and the price of the finished product.  The authority recently published a report on the pub business. There is an adequate number of pubs.  I have yet to hear of anyone becoming thirsty because they could not get to a pub.  The Government should direct the authority to address the prices paid by the factories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in rural Ireland is talking about the bad prices for livestock which are below the European average.  One of the newspapers yesterday carried the headline, &ldquo;No price rises despite beef refunds top-up.&rdquo; This is a cause of great concern.  Export refunds on live male cattle are to increase by 7.7 per cent and on boneless beef cuts by an average of 12 per cent.  These increases work out at 5p per pound.  The Minister asked processors to pass them on to producers but that has not happened.  It is surprising that meat factories are not referred to in the motion. I hope the Minister will remain in contact with Commissioner Fischler to devise a plan to lessen the impact of market difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is most important that markets closed following the BSE scare are reopened.  The Minister has had meetings with livestock exporters to make arrangements for the early shipping of live cattle to Libya as well as the Continent.  Approximately 100,000 cattle have been exported so far this year compared to less than 30,000 for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>I hope the subsidy of £10 million to which the Minister referred will be of use.  According to a detailed assessment produced by Teagasc in the middle of August, 20 per cent of farmers in the north-west and the south-west have been unable to save any fodder due to wet weather conditions and 50 per cent of farmers in these areas will be short of fodder this winter.  It is important that farmers are offered assistance in preparing feed budgets and in the movement of fodder from east to west.  I hope the farming organisations will be involved.</P>
      <P>I am a great supporter of the family income supplement scheme and hope a way can be found to extend it to farmers and the self-employed. Failing that, the small holder's assistance scheme should be used to help farmers who find themselves in serious financial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Ms Coughlan Ms Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Ms Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measures introduced by the Minister in recognition of the serious crisis in farming, particularly sheep farming and the suckler cow herd.  I welcome the announcement with regard to the fodder scheme. I hope farmers in County Donegal receive favourable consideration given the high rainfall <Col N="275" /> recorded.  I welcome the export of live cattle to Libya and hope it will restore balance to the market following the loss of the Russian market. There is a need to double the number of cattle exported to the European market.  In 1997 the pig industry created £264 million.  Donegal farmers are getting approximately £17.50 less per pig than southern farmers because of the serious problems of access to slaughtering facilities.  Farmers have told me that in 1974 they got £46 per pig, and now some have to accept £23 per pig.</P>
      <P>Pontification from any side of the House and attacks from the farming organisations will not solve this problem.  It will be solved through strong action.  The Minister will have to take on the supermarkets and factories.</P>

      <P>The money the Minister made available should have gone to the farmer, but it has not.  People should be told that there will be no more support.  That is erroneous and works against the farmer.  Supermarkets are neither providing meat at a fair price nor creating leniency towards Irish products.  It is difficult to believe that even in Donegal one can get Argentinian beef.  Housewives do not even know where it comes from.</P>
      <P>The factories will have to be taken on in the live export sector, and I support the Minister in this task.  It is not easy but it will have to be done if we are to have stability in the farming industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihan" hpid="Mr. M. Moynihan Mr. M. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt the Minister faces one of the greatest crises in Irish agriculture in recent decades for two reasons which are outside his control: the collapse of the Russian market and the inclement weather during the summer.  As we face into winter, family farms will be affected and people will suffer.  Some of them will be without an income to put food on the table, and that will have to be addressed by the Department of Agriculture and Food or the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a fodder crisis, and I welcome the initiatives announced in recent days to deal with this.  Every area claims to be worst affected, but my area has suffered a serious crisis since the middle of July.  There have been dairy cows in sheds since mid-July; they were left out for a brief respite in August but are now back inside because of the inclement weather we have had for the past two weeks.  Political points can be scored by saying it is the fault of the Government, but a number of initiatives have taken place in my area of Duhallow, where local co-operatives have begun a fodder scheme.  Fodder is being transported from parts of the country which have a surplus because they have not suffered a fodder crisis. This is being supplied at no cost to farmers.  The co-operatives have a part to play in this problem <Col N="276" /> and, as Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, the banks will also have to play their part.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a 7.7 per cent increase he achieved in Brussels, but the meat factories have not returned that to the farmer.  Are those factories making a bigger profit on the backs of farmers?  This will have to be addressed through the Consumers Association of Ireland or another body.  If one buys a beef heifer at any mart one is paying £100 to £120 less than their weight for that animal.  Has anyone bought a steak in a restaurant for less this year than last year?  The Consumers Association of Ireland will have to look at a lot of the questions being raised by this crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. D. Moynihan Mr. D. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcements of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs tonight.  Regarding the beef market, I am pleased that the Libyan market has been reopened by the Minister and that export refunds have been increased.  I hope that at least the additional money given to the Minister will be passed onto the consumer as soon as possible.  I call on processors to ensure that extra money will be paid to farmers immediately.</P>
      <P>Regarding the pig industry, there has been a £1.25 reduction in meat inspection fees.  However, the farmer is being paid a reduced price, and this reduction should be passed onto the consumer, which is not happening.  If it were the case, Irish producers would oversell foreign produce both at home and abroad, and this would also help to alleviate the hardship being suffered by farmers. I call on processors and supermarkets to ensure pigmeat prices for the consumer are reduced considerably.</P>

Everyone knows where I come from; I come from the heart of the present disaster &mdash; places like Mangerton Mountain, Glencar and the Black Valley.  As Deputy Sheehan said, only a tunnel separates me from him.  The sheep farmers in south Kerry and south-west Cork have massive problems this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister to come to these people's assistance.  The Minister knows how desperate matters are.  Small hill farmers have no winter feed available, and without the Minister's assistance they will not survive this winter.  They will not be here in 12 months.  They have no sods of turf, no bales of hay and rotten silage.  These areas are severely handicapped. Some areas of the country enjoyed good weather and have plenty of feed to spare.  Those areas are better off this year than they were last year. <Col N="277" /> The one part of the Minister's proposals that worries me is the danger that, like past schemes, the big farmer will cash in.  I rely on the Minister and his staff to assist the small hill farmers and small dairy farmers.</P>
      <P>Away from the doom and gloom I compliment the Minister for what he has done.  When others in the House were enjoying the sun in the Bahamas and getting a colour, the Minister and his officials accepted phone calls from me and ensured that five loads of weanlings were shipped out of the country.  I compliment and thank them for their assistance during that crucial period when there were major problems.  The Minister played a leading role when other people were at races or enjoying themselves in the sun.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy-Rae</NameTxt>
      <P>The veterinary levy is applied to pigs to the tune of £1.25 for each one and this is hitting the pig industry.  I appeal to the Minister to sort out the application of this levy with the European Union.  I know it cannot be suspended but I ask him to do something.</P>
      <P>We are an island nation and it is appalling that we do not have a ship of our own.  The indication I got around the country is that there is not a single person involved in farming who is not prepared to contribute or assist in some way towards the provision of a vessel of our own which will be available to us when we want it.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this proposal and to come to our assistance by providing this vessel soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the opportunity to give our views on the crisis.  No one should be under any illusion, and the Minister knows better than anyone, that there is a crisis in agriculture on a number of fronts.  The price paid for commodities is well below what is expected.  That represents a major loss of income to farmers at all levels and all producers are suffering.</P>
      <P>There are now more cattle in this country than ever before.  There has been an overhang of cattle in the past 18 months to two years as farmers held on to more stock than normal.  This has led to overstocking in certain areas.  Be that as it may, a genuine effort is being made by all involved to try to develop markets.  We all welcome the reopening of the Libyan market.  We know it was not simple and that many arms had to be twisted to reopen it.  We also know the Minister will visit Iran in the next few weeks to reopen that market. With goodwill and common sense, that market will be reopened for Irish beef.</P>
      <P>That is a small issue in comparison with the overall problem which is that we have been commodity sellers and traders in the dumping markets of the world for the past ten years.  We have never concentrated on where the major prices were to be had, which was in Europe.  We preferred to sell the 10,000 and 20,000 tonnes anywhere as long as the refunds remained in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> We are now paying the price for that.  On top of that, the BSE crisis has led to a downturn in consumption.</P>
    <P>There are two other problems.  There is a fodder crisis which affects a large part of the country. If someone tells me a round bale of hay at £18 is fodder which can be bought by farmers, I will tell them it is out of the question because it is not a realistic or viable option.  Teagasc must educate people in using concentrates along with the minimal amount of fodder available.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing everything to ensure the package of which he spoke is finalised as quickly as possible.  However, it is only a start in dealing with the problem.  It will return in the months ahead.  While the payments are being made and it is important for farmers to receive them to get their bills up to date, that is all the money will be used for.  It will be used to pay for last spring's feed and fertiliser and other bits and pieces, such as the children going back to school.  This initial allocation of £10 million will help to alleviate the problem in the short-term.  However, it must be examined in the long-term.  We must see what assistance can be made available within reason to get people out of the fodder crisis.  I believe the Minister accepts that and I know there will be a need for further moneys down the road when the crisis is fully assessed.  I understand that Teagasc is only half way through an in-depth analysis of the position.</P>
    <P>The other problem is income.  I hope something will be done to put in place a family income supplement or to pay unemployment assistance to small farmers.  There is enough money to deal with this short-term crisis.  To put people out of farming in the short-term will have a devastating effect on the economy in the long-term.  Whether people like it or not, farming has, down the years, been the backbone of the economy.  I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will see to it that whatever needs to be done over the months ahead will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We should welcome the initiatives the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has proposed to tackle what is undoubtedly a serious crisis.  Any assistance which can be given will be welcomed and any support which can come from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will be welcomed by many smallholders.  Many of these measures are short-term and the discussion on the future of the industry will have to wait for a later date.  Nonetheless it is relevant to what we are discussing today.</P>
      <P>The crisis in the industry has been precipitated by a number of problems.  We are all familiar with the BSE problem and the serious lack of confidence and trust in the integrity of our meat.  It has suffered seriously and grievously because of that. The process of rebuilding that confidence in the quality of our meat will take time and will cost a great deal of money.  The quicker it can be achieved, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> We have had exceptionally bad weather this year.  It has created difficulties for those on heavy land who should be harvesting fodder for their stock for the winter.  We have heard stories of individual farmers having stock indoors back in August.  That has certainly not happened in the recent past.  It has been a long time since it happened and I hope it is a long time before it happens again.  The grain harvest is very important to my constituency and this has been the most difficult harvest for many years.  The crisis would be even worse were it not for the machinery available to help with harvesting.  There will be a substantial loss of income due to the weather and the quality of grain.</P>
    <P>There are also serious difficulties in the pig industry.  Over production in the EU has led to a serious loss for farmers.  The day is gone when farmers had six sows requiring a minimal commitment in capital for accommodation.  A Teagasc specialist told me that a person starting in the pig industry would spend £500,000 on accommodation and buying stock.  That is not a realistic proposition for one individual.  If they can make money in construction or development it might be possible, but pig farming is not viable today.</P>
    <P>There has been rapid change in agriculture over recent years.  However, many of the Agenda 2000 proposals would precipitate an even more rapid change.  If milk quotas are abolished and milk is traded as a commodity at world prices, there will be a dramatic change in the structure of farming, leading to a mass exodus from the industry.  Farming has been the main wealth creator in this economy and it will be devastated unless the community is prepared to take account of the unique farm structure.  This economy cannot afford to dispense with an industry which has created such wealth.  Our policies must be structured to ensure that we remain as viable as possible and that we retain as many people as possible within the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the saddest night for farmers that I have known in Dáil Éireann.  When people are hungry they come out and fight.  Deputy Dermot Ahern stated that representatives of the IFA attended a parliamentary party meeting and spoke of the wonderful job being done by the <Col N="280" /> three wise men from the south.  In my catechism the three wise men came from the east and we are suffering with the three wise men from the south.</P>
      <P>I listened with amazement to statements that the IFA had commented on the wonderful job being done by the Minister.  I do not wish to be too critical of the Minister as I do not blame him for everything.  I blame the Taoiseach, the Táiniste and the Government.</P>
      <P>I remember being in the Davenport Hotel when the IFA rounded up 1,500 people and Fianna Fáil rounded up about 3,000 people. Fianna Fáil was always good at rounding up people to get the fight going.  I wish I had recorded Deputy Cowen on the occasion when he made the most passionate speech of all.  Deputy Cowen and the present Minister had all the answers and said there would be no problems in agriculture for the next 20 years.  I was amazed to hear Fianna Fáil backbenchers urging us not to make this issue a political football.  That is typical of Fianna Fáil in Government.  However, in Opposition the party is like the Galway football team &mdash; it attacks on all fronts.</P>
      <P>Officials in the Department of Agriculture and Food were cheering when the Taoiseach announced that Deputy Walsh was the new Minister. Their view was that he would not lead the Department but the officials would lead him, and that has been the case since he took office.</P>
      <P>Farmers have had to wait up to 16 months for payments from the area aid section.  The REPS scheme was a good one under the previous Government but it is a disaster since the Minister and his colleague took office.  There are only one or two inspectors in County Mayo and farmers have to wait up to nine months for spot checks.  I have no problem with spot checks provided they are carried out in the morning.  However, I have a problem when farmers have to wait up to seven months.  That is not good enough and the Minister can easily deal with this problem.  He can instruct his officials to tell people that they will be paid if the spot checks cannot be carried out in time.  If a problem is discovered later the money can be deducted.  However, this is not happening. There are not enough inspectors with the result that farmers have to wait for their money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose is like myself in that he deals with ordinary people on a daily basis.  Like the Minister, the IFA lost touch with people for a while.  That organisation is now back in touch. There were 1,000 farmers protesting outside the House last week, some from my constituency. Peoples' stomachs are hurting and that is why they are responding.  They cannot feed their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A woman came to my clinic recently and told me that under the previous Government she had a medical card, was in receipt of social welfare and farming was not too bad.  I was delighted to see a banner stating &ldquo;Bring Back Yates&rdquo; at last week's protest &mdash; times have changed.  Deputy Yates must not have done a bad job.  Another <Col N="281" /> poster stated that farmers would even accept Deputy De Rossa as Minister for Agriculture and Food.  That is an indication of how bad the Government's performance has been.</P>
    <P>During the general election campaign I saw a banner asking what Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left would do for farming.  I responded to 1,000 people in Westport by asking what would happen if Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats got together?  We see what is happening and we know what Deputy Harney thinks of rural Ireland, agriculture and people like the woman who visited my clinic.  That woman had 100 lambs and 200 ewes.  Last week she sold the ewes for £200 and the lambs for £4 each, making a total of £600.  She has a number of children and it would cost her £720 to join the VHI but she could not make up the difference. That is an indication of what the Government has done for agriculture.</P>
    <P>I listened to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, earlier.  All he could do was send out social welfare inspectors to count the number of lambs, sheep, geese, cows and bulls.  Now he wants to tell his inspectors and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, that when assessing these people for social welfare and medical cards they should take into account what this poor lady got for her lambs and sheep last week.</P>

With no disrespect to my colleagues over here, they did not forget on the last occasion when they had to deal with certain parties who did not look after them in Government.  Deputy Roche lost his seat in a previous election and he should watch it now because the farmers are waiting for him.</P>

      <P>After Deputy Ring's <i>tour de force</i> our time slot is reduced.  Therefore, I will confine my remarks to a few minutes.  I welcome the debate and congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his initiative in tabling the motion as the first Private Member's motion in the new session. On occasion when a farming crisis has hit the media the public has taken it as the farmers crying wolf.  This time the wolf crying is genuine.  The wolf has come to the doors of rural Ireland and taken the Celtic tiger from farm families and rural <Col N="282" /> people.  There is need for a strong and positive Government response.</P>
      <P>The extent of the problem was admitted by the Taoiseach this afternoon, perhaps inadvertently, when he indicated it would take possibly £50 million should the family income supplement type solution be provided.  The Minister has given us his own solution which will cost £10 million.  The Taoiseach said that the farming crisis, if it was to be resolved, would cost £50 million and yet the solution from the Minister, Deputy Walsh, is £40 million less.  This indicates the extent of the problem and shows how inadequate is the Government's response.  The Minister is attempting to deal with the short-term crisis which may pass but the net effect of the long-term crisis is that it will continue to make agriculture a very unattractive career option for young people.</P>
      <P>A speaker mentioned earlier that 70,000 people have left the land in the past two or three decades.  In recent months all of us in rural areas have attended the presentation of green certificates to farming students.  We have seen a decline in the number of people attending those courses and agricultural colleges are almost on the point of closure.  The message going out from the Minister tonight is that he accepts the reduction in farming numbers and that he does not have a plan to put people back into farming.  That is a negative message and one we must address urgently. The fodder, weather and price crises can be dealt with if the Minister has the will to do so. However the broader crisis of confidence is turning people against farming as a way of life.</P>
      <P>The farm installation grant which the Minister promised to retain was scrapped but he has been promising to reintroduce it for the past 12 months.  He needs to make an urgent announcement in that regard.  He must also respond by means of the family income supplement. I understand there could be some administrative difficulties but if the family income supplement is not seen as the appropriate solution to the immediate cash crisis we have to instruct the various health board personnel to ensure supplementary welfare regulations will be introduced.  I hope the Minister will take my comments on board as we need a much greater response than what we have seen to date.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to have a debate on the single biggest crisis that has hit the country in a long time.  Irrespective of the fact that Fianna Fáil backbenchers think Fine Gael as an Opposition party is creating a political football out of this crisis, I ask them to recall when BSE was an issue, which was not caused by the then Government.  At that time the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Taoiseach were the very people who said that all one had to do was get on an <Col N="283" /> aeroplane and open the markets in Iran, Egypt, Libya and elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifteen months later the Minister has not yet visited Iran.  When in Opposition four of his party could go out when a boat was half unloaded and try to claim responsibility. Because of their presence the market was shut down and it was some months later before it was reopened.  We must face facts.  The Minister has failed dismally.  I said previously the Minister is a nice person, but the farmers are not looking for a nice person, they want a Minister who will defend their rights.  The Minister said previously he did not like his budget to be cut.  We have £10 million to sort out this crisis.  Only a few months ago the Government got £31 million to help the Third World and I welcome that, but in terms of the Government's commitment to the serious problem in agriculture £10 million is a disaster.</P>
      <P>Before coming into Government the Minister said installation aid, farm grants and hygiene grants would be introduced immediately.  He knew the finances were available.  In reply to my parliamentary question today he said funds are not available and that he does not know when those grants will be reintroduced.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the craic is so good the Minister is not prepared to listen, because the pig crisis is also real.  The Minister has done nothing about the pig crisis.  The reality is that pigs in the Border area today, especially in Donegal, are worth as low as £23 &mdash; I was given a quote of £35 &mdash; but in Mitchelstown they are £58.  It is no wonder there is no crisis there.  The Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and Deputy Allen are not in the hot area of Cavan-Monghan or Donegal where pigs cannot be sold. What can be done?  It is in the Minister's power to issue a licence to Dromone Meats but he has failed to do so.  This means that pigs that could have been exported have not been exported.  The charge for a certificate to allow pig farmers to export pigs across the Border is £35.  I understand that is not the case in Donegal but certainly it is in Cavan-Monaghan.  If pigs cannot be exported this week another permit will be required next week.  This is a problem the Minister can alleviate immediately to allow for competition.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement is not a political football, I raised it in the previous Government and in this Government.  Not long ago the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, told a public meeting that it would cost £35 million to provide family income supplement for the self-employed.  It should be provided because farmers need it.  The cost has been pumped up to £70 million or £80 million.  If that is the factual figure it is an indication of how low farm incomes are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Small dairy farmers in my parish of Aghabog will get none of this £10 million.  They have their cows in since mid-June and did not get a second <Col N="284" /> cut of silage.  They are not entitled to this money because of political decisions on headage payments. Half of the parish is classified as severely handicapped and nothing is being done about that.  No young farmers are prepared to go into farming because the Minister made promises 18 months ago which he has failed to implement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and the sentiments expressed by colleagues on this side of the House.  There is a crisis in the agriculture sector and when it has financial difficulties many business people in rural areas also suffer as agriculture is the mainstay of the economy in such places.  I agree the Minister has sat on his hands and has not taken the crisis seriously.  A sheep farmer rang me last week saying he never thought he would see the day when it would take three ewes to buy a pint of Guinness.  If he was buying Guinness in Dublin it would take six ewes. Nothing is being done in the face of such facts. When the Minister was in Opposition he promised the sun, moon and stars as spokesperson on agriculture.  My father says the Lord does not always pay on a Saturday night, but he always pays and it is now time that the Minister started doing something to end the crisis which exists.</P>
      <P>The provision of £10 million will not solve the problem.  In County Leitrim many farmers have not even got 50 per cent of their fodder. The Minister said he would reintroduce the control of farmyard pollution scheme but there is no sign of it or money for it.  He also said he would introduce the dairy hygiene scheme but, similarly, there is no sign of it.  Therefore we cannot take for granted anything the Minister says as what he has said in the past has been held up to ridicule and found to be based on political expediency.  Fine Gael does not intend to be driven by political expediency.  We are serious about the issues affecting the people we represent.</P>
      <P>Family income supplement should be extended to the agriculture community which is experiencing severe difficulties in paying bills and sending children to college.  The provision of £10 million will not solve the problem but should be the start of the great amount of work which must be done over the next number of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely amazed that the Minister has not realised the serious situation in the agriculture industry.  A major crisis has arisen. When Deputy Yates was Minister he was hounded day in day out by the current Minister and Members of Fianna Fáil who said he should have been doing better.  The worst problem that ever befell the beef industry, namely, the BSE crisis, occurred when Deputy Yates was Minister. Deputy Yates had to stabilise the markets and find alternative markets for beef.  He did his best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sixteen months later the current Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach produced a multi-coloured leaflet entitled &ldquo;A message from Fianna Fáil to the farmers and farm <Col N="285" /> families of Ireland&rdquo; which said: &ldquo;political action will be supported by investment inside the farm gate&rdquo;.  I have seen no evidence of this.  The leaflet continued, &ldquo;in Opposition we have deplored the closure of the on-farm investment schemes.  In Government we will ensure that a viable on-farm investment programme is put into place. Additionally, Fianna Fáil will renegotiate the farm retirement scheme, particularly the enlargement clause, to allow greater uptake of the scheme&rdquo;.  What has happened since?  Within three months of the Minister taking office, he scrapped the farm installation scheme and has not yet even attempted to reintroduce it.  This is despite the fact that three weeks ago at the presentation of certificates in Clonakilty he announced to the people of Darrara College that he had got approval from the Government for its reintroduction. The Minister should be honest and state whether he has got approval for its reintroduction. It should be reintroduced to give an impetus to the livelihoods of those in the farming community.</P>
    <P>I have a return from AIBP Ltd., Rathkeale, County Limerick, for five one and a half year old bullocks which made a total of £841.46. When the veterinarian fees of £18.50, the ABB levy of £7.50, the EIF levy of £1.27, the BDE levy of £10, the SRM levy of £15, the insurance fee of £15 and the haulage fee of £25 were paid, the net return was £749.19, or £149.64 per bullock.  This does not take into consideration the AI costs before the calves were born.</P>
    <P>There has been a collapse in lamb prices. Everybody is aware that mountain lambs were for sale in Deputy Healy-Rae's home town as late as three weeks ago for £3 each.  A farmer from Glengarriff brought 15 culled ewes to Macroom mart and got only one bid of 50p each.  He accepted the bid which did not pay the entry fee for the ewes to the mart.  Is this the prosperity we were told would come to agriculture?  The Minister must do something to rectify the situation before it is too late.  I appeal to Deputy Healy-Rae to cross the floor of the House and vote with Fine Gael if he has the interests of south Kerry farmers at heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  There is a crisis in the beef industry with insufficient income for beef producers.  As a result, and apart from 100 farmers per week leaving the land, there is a huge number of winter fatteners going out of business.  This has already been stated in the debate and the Minister is aware of it.  The winter fatteners are at least as important as the ships traveling the high seas.  Two years ago a £50 headage payment was made available to heifer fatteners which cost £10 million.  There is now a far greater crisis in the sheep, beef and pig industries and the Minister has only proposed a package of £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has one outfit a monopoly in terms of slaughtering capacity?  Why can pigs make 7p per kilo more in the south than in Meath or the Border <Col N="286" /> counties?  Both the Minister and I know the answer.  I think the Minister knows the gentleman who runs the organisations concerned and I would appreciate it if he would talk to him and ask him to pay the same price across the country. The current situation is not acceptable.  Why has Dromone meats in Oldcastle, County Meath, not been given an export licence for which it applied last February?  I was told by the Department that the reason is the cost involved in putting veterinary surgeons into the factory.  Is this an acceptable answer for people who are literally losing their shirts?</P>
    <P>In the context of the pig industry, millers have given six month credit to farmers.  When will any of the farmers concerned be able to pay this back?  How many family farm children have not got the money and school fees which are required on a weekly basis to attend primary schools which in most cases receive a capitation grant of only £50?  Today I spoke to somebody on the board of management of a small rural school which since June 1998 is in the red to the tune of £2,200.  The parents of the children attending such schools will be asked for the money although they do not have it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that prior to this debate there was no recognition by the Minister or the Government of the serious crisis in farming. The recognition seems to exist now and I hope something will be done about it.  A particular problem in my constituency concerns hill sheep farmers in Connemara.  Normally at this time of year approximately 50,000 lambs are sold off the hills in the area.  This year 10 per cent of the lambs in the region have been sold.</P>
      <P>The withdrawal of ewes and lambs from sale will lead to serious environmental and humanitarian problems for the animals as they will simply be returned to the hills.  Some of them will die as, because of the fodder shortage, the hills will be overgrazed.  This is a particular problem for farmers in the REPS and SAC areas who are obliged to reduce their stock numbers by between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.  How is that possible when wether rams are selling for less than £5 per head?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway's victory in the All-Ireland final has lifted the spirits of Connemara farmers.  I attended the match on Sunday where I met people from various parts of the country who recognised me from my former occupation as a livestock auctioneer.  Prior to becoming a TD, I sold sheep at Maam Cross mart.  Farmers from throughout the country bought store lambs at the mart.  I urge those farmers to come down to the marts at Maam Cross or Clifden where they will be able to purchase 100 or 120 lambs for approximately £500.  That would represent a very good financial proposition for anyone with after grass. Every extra customer coming into Connemara at this time will help to alleviate the overflow of small mountain wether rams.  Difficulties exist in regard to fodder and grass shortages and there is <Col N="287" /> no confidence in farming.  I urge the Minister to double the headage payments for the hill sheep farmers as an immediate response to the current crisis.</P>

      <P>I recognise the realistic statement made by the Labour Party leader and his spokesman, Deputy Penrose.  This problem is not confined to Ireland; it exists throughout the world in farming.  People are leaving farming as there is a perception that there is no future in it.  The Government has responded to that and has been asked to produce a White Paper and a vision statement as to how we see Ireland in ten to 15 years time.</P>

      <P>There is an unprecedented crisis in <Col N="288" /> agriculture at the moment.  I am extremely disappointed with the Minister of State's response.  He seems to be throwing in the towel and blaming the problems on a worldwide recession.  The factors which caused the crisis may be outside the immediate control of the Government but it is the Government's job to protect the interests and livelihoods of Irish farmers.  Perhaps the Russian collapse, the worldwide economic crisis and, more importantly, chickens coming home to roost from the MacSharry CAP reforms are contributory factors but it is the Government's responsibility to protect the interests of Irish farmers.</P>
      <P>This Government is infatuated with the Celtic tiger.  Ministers will fly around the world to the boardrooms of major multinational companies to try to bring in new jobs but they should remember that 340,000 people are employed directly and indirectly in agriculture.  If we could safeguard their interests, we would be doing a good day's work.</P>
      <P>The Government's response to the agriculture crisis is pathetic in the extreme.  The Minister should publish the survey carried out by Teagasc. It indicated that the crisis in fodder alone was in the region of £30 million nationally.  In October last year, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs stated that the extension of FIS to self-employed people would cost approximately £30 million.  Today, the Taoiseach stated that because of the escalating crisis in agriculture, it would cost in the region of £50 million to extend the scheme.  Therein lies the scale of the problem. A figure of £80 million or perhaps £100 million would perhaps be nearer the mark.  The Government has responded with a pathetic £10 million.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the points made by Deputy Ellis.  An Bord Bia is doing a reasonable job.  The graduates coming out of our colleges would sell sand in the Sahara and ice in Alaska if we only pumped the necessary resources into An Bord Bia.  We are price takers because we are not brand makers.  If we could brand our products, we could sell them anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>A great deal was said about the fact that weanlings were being exported.  The results of that will be seen in 12 or 18 months' time when the best of the cattle have been exported at weanling stage.  The factories should have their ears clipped for their failure to pass export refund increases on to farmers.  In 12 or 18 months' time, we will be faced with a situation where we will be trying to sell the worst Irish beef for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large section of agriculture in the area of winter packing does not have access to raw materials and is fast going out of business. Nothing is being done to protect their livelihoods. The Government's response falls far short of the mark.  There is an air of despondency in the agriculture sector as people believe the Minister and the Government have no interest in the livelihoods of the people who have formed the backbone of the Irish economy for so long.  The <Col N="289" /> response to date has been appalling and I support the motion wholeheartedly.</P>

      <P>It is not an overstatement to say there is a total confidence deficit in Irish agriculture at present.  I will not exaggerate the despair and anger which is there.  The lack of confidence in the future of agriculture is manifested in the decline in the number of young people applying for places in agricultural colleges this year.  They are turning their backs on the family farms.</P>
      <P>The fodder crisis was well signalled in June and July.  Thousands of farmers attempted to salvage their winter fodder in the worst weather conditions since 1946.  They realised they were on their own and no-one gave a damn until they marched in Dublin.  I welcome the £10 million aid package.  However, it is a derisory amount considering there is a surplus of £800 million.</P>
      <P>A Teagasc survey in County Kerry found that a significant percentage of farmers have no winter fodder.  I met some of these farmers.  They will have to give up farming and no-one cares. Between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of farmers will be far short of their fodder requirement next winter.  The average costs for them to meet their fodder requirement, whether round bales or feed, is £4,000.  If 4,000 farmers in Kerry have this problem, where will £10 million go?</P>
      <P>There is despair among farmers.  We need direction in the form of a local policy from co-ops and a national policy which we do not have at present.  We have a European policy which we cannot get away from.  There is no intervention whatsoever.  As regards a rural development policy document, I established a strategy group which led to a report which will be used in that document.  I went to Cabinet and received approval for a rural development policy White Paper.  That is where it started.  I wish Deputy Davern the best of luck with it.  I will give him support and some good ideas.</P>

      <P>The announcement of £30 million compensation is a slap in the face to the hardpressed farmers and their current crisis.  The Minister behaved like an ostrich over the summer months by burying his head in the sand and hoping that the problem would go away.  Farmers are losing up to £100 per head on cattle due to the current turmoil in third country markets.  The Minister and An Bord Bia have failed to promote or open up new markets for Irish beef.  It is time for the Minister to bite the bullet and begin to sort out this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why has the Minister failed to open up markets?  This is one of the main issues on which the Government campaigned during the last election campaign.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach were seen as the great white hope for agriculture &mdash; now they are seen to be full of white smoke.  The Minister announced last week that he will visit Iran next month, hoping to re-open trade.  Why has the Minister waited until <Col N="290" /> now?  Is he aware the Dutch have already signed a contract with the Iranians to export beef?  This market is worth 70,000 head of cattle.</P>
    <P>The exporting of animals is bureaucracy gone mad.  It is now easier to get a passport than to get an animal out of this country.  At a time when the EU is phasing out passports in the Community, it is now introducing passports for cattle.  What type of common market is this?</P>
    <P>The Minister is so inept that he has lost the confidence of many young people.  The abolition of the installation aid scheme has ensured that many young prospective farmers are turning their backs on the agricultural industry.  One can now hurl marbles in any classroom in agricultural colleges throughout the country as many young people have no incentive to enter the industry.  At the same time, the Government is funding each industrial job to the tune of £13,000.  The installation aid, and the control of farmyard pollution schemes, must be reintroduced to encourage confidence in the industry.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems facing Irish agriculture can be traced back to the MacSharry GATT agreement.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food was the Irish representative at the Council of Agriculture Ministers which ratified this on behalf of the Irish Government.  Irish beef exports to third country markets were to be dramatically reduced over the term of this agreement.  The Minister made the bed and now he expects Irish farmers to sleep in it.</P>
    <P>The Farmers' Charter of Rights, introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Yates, was heralded by the Department of Agriculture and Food as a new way forward.  However, since the Minister took office this has fallen by the wayside.  While bringing forward payments will help alleviate current fodder problems, many families will go hungry this Christmas.  Santa Claus will not be arriving down many chimneys unless headage payments are increased and the current crisis is tackled immediately.</P>
    <P>The Government has refused to introduce a family income supplement for low income farming families because of the £80 million cost of extending the scheme.  By the Government's admission this shows the extent of the crisis in farming.  This is due to the Minister who is sitting in the hot seat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was one of the 150,000 families affected and I heard what was said here today, I would have to say the Government was not acting in my best interests.  The Minister will do the best he can.  However, I deplore the intervention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  Not alone is there no FIS, but there is no compassion either.  He showed no compassion for Irish farmers today.  He said farmers and the self-employed are not entitled to FIS.  One of the major demands of every farmer I have met in the past two months has been shot down today.  This is a negative debate in that regard.  Intervention by <Col N="291" /> the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will be discussed at every crossroads in the country this winter.</P>
      <P>The element of the cost of social welfare has arisen many times over the years.  There were several occasions when the EU overruled our social welfare legislation.  This cost hundreds of millions of pounds to resolve.  This is discrimination against Irish farming families.  If we have achieved nothing else tonight, we have flushed out a Minister and a Government who have decided not to help farmers, even though they are entitled to FIS as much as any other low income family.</P>
      <P>It was unfortunate that while the Minister did his best to get an increase in refunds, at the same time the European Commission decided to flood the Russian market with intervention beef.  Some meat factory salespeople were trying to sell Irish beef against beef which was selling for 23p per pound.  This is a cock-eyed policy and something will have to be done at governmental level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> There is a huge difficulty in one of the biggest and most important sectors of the Irish economy. We cannot blame anyone in particular.  Thankfully, our economy is awash with money and Ministers are fighting among themselves as to what we will spend it on in the next budget. However, they were united in being able to find £10 million in a most peculiar way.  The Minister and the Department had enough time to inform the House about who will benefit from that £10 million and when they will benefit.  They promise £10 million but farmers do not know under what rules or conditions.  It appears to have been a haphazard decision.</P>
    <P>The Independent Deputies now have an opportunity to vote for the people who sent them to the Dáil.  If the four rural Independent Deputies vote with the Government tonight, they can only be considered active Fianna Fáil Deputies, not Independents.  They certainly will not be representing the people who sent them to the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter as the first item on the Adjournment in the new Dáil session.  I also thank the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, for coming before the House to take this debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the deep concern and unease at the circumstances surrounding the sale in January 1992 of 147 acres of State forest lands to Roadstone (Dublin) Ltd.  In January 1987 Hudson Brothers Ltd., a long established sand and gravel company, contacted the Department of Energy and expressed in writing an interest in acquiring the gravel at Glen Ding.  The response from the Department on 22 June 1987 stated that &ldquo;the material in question is not surplus to our requirements, it is not intended to dispose of it in the foreseeable future&rdquo;.  Following representations from Hudson Brothers to Deputy Flood and the late Deputy Sean Walsh, the then Minister for Forestry, Deputy Michael Smith, replied in writing on 5 November 1987 and stated:</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries for you in the matter and the position is that the sand and gravel deposits are required for State afforestation purposes and as such are not available for sale. I would like to add that even if the deposits were available for sale, the area could be offered for sale by public tender competition in accordance with Department of Finance delegated sanction for such sales.</P>
      <P>This clearly stated policy outlined by the then Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, was subsequently entirely ignored.</P>
      <P>Despite the clearly expressed interest of Hudson Brothers, of another party &mdash; Mr. Brendan Johnston &mdash; and others as indicated to me in a letter from the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, on 21 September this year which stated &ldquo;the Department's files indicate that a number of parties had expressed interest in the lands prior to the decision to dispose of the lands to Roadstone&rdquo;, these lands were sold by private treaty to Roadstone.  The Minister's letter also indicates that &ldquo;the then Minister for Energy was satisfied that if the land were put on the open market it would most likely fail to reach the price on offer from Roadstone (Dublin) Ltd&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, through a spokesman, informed <i>The Irish Times</i> in July of this year that &ldquo;when Minister Molloy approved the sale he was not aware that Hudson Brothers had expressed interest in buying the land.  As far as Minister Molloy was concerned the only two interested parties were CRH and a businessman, Mr. Brendan Johnston&rdquo;.  It seems incredible that valuable land was sold for £1.25 million &mdash; including the price paid for the trees on it &mdash; sanctioned by &ldquo;a Minister who was unaware that a number of parties had expressed interest in the lands prior to the decision to dispose of them to Roadstone&rdquo;.  If Deputy Molloy is to be taken at his word &mdash; I have no reason not to believe him &mdash; then vital information which it is now acknowledged existed in the Department of Energy was kept from him when he sanctioned this sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many issues which require investigation in this matter.  The circumstances I have outlined require urgent investigation.  Deputy Roche raised this matter at the Committee of Public Accounts and sought such an investigation. <Col N="297" /> I would like to share some of the remaining time with the Deputy to afford him the opportunity to make a contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but there are only 30 seconds remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and this House must provide a mechanism to fully explore these matters.  I expect the Minister to share my concern and to provide the means to arrive at the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal views and grave concerns about this matter have been a matter of public record for over 12 months.  I do not know if wrongdoing occurred in this case or if an administrative error was made.  However, I know the sale of that land was not completed in an appropriate way.  I wrote to the chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts in December, February and July and he afforded me an opportunity to make a presentation to the committee on 17 September.  Following my appearance before the committee I submitted a substantial amount of documents for its consideration.</P>
      <P>There is clear <i>prima facie</i> evidence that this matter must be investigated.  I requested the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out such an investigation.  I am not suggesting that the then Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, was in any way culpable; I believe he was not.  A reading of the files or the papers in my possession clearly indicates that he acted with the utmost propriety, as did the then Minister for Forestry, Deputy Michael Smith.  However, something wrong occurred in this case because 25 million cubic tonnes of sand and gravel were sold at a price of less than 2p per tonne when the sand and gravel had been valued at in excess of £2 per tonne.</P>
      <P>It would be in the public interest for the Committee of Public Accounts to open the files and examine them.  Regardless of whether wrongdoing is discovered, it would be in the public interest for people to be made aware of that.  I thank Deputy Howlin for sharing time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which has been raised on a number of occasions.  The Secretary-General and Accounting Officer of my Department who reviewed the relevant papers, advised that there was no evidence to suggest that there was any impropriety in this matter.  I also refer the House to a reply by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to a parliamentary question on 15 May 1997 which sets out in detail the circumstances surrounding the sale of these lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will set out these circumstances again.  The property in question at Glen Ding Woods was sold in December 1991 to the then Department of Energy which at the time had statutory responsibility for forestry matters.  On foot of a <Col N="298" /> Government decision in 1987 that a programme for the sale of State property should be devised and the receipts therefrom be used to redeem the National Debt and in line with all Departments the forest service identified a number of suitable properties for sale.  The possible sale of the Glen Ding lands arose in that regard.</P>
    <P>The interest shown by Roadstone brought to notice the potential sale value of those lands and the contribution the proceeds of any sale would make to meeting the Department of Energy's budget requirements.  However, progress in moving forward was slow.  The initial deliberations within the forest service focused on disposal of the Glen Ding lands by public tender.  There were assessments of the value of the lands and consideration of the merits of seeking planning permission before offering the lands for sale.  In that context there were discussions with independent consultants from September 1988 onwards in regard to disposal of the property at the best possible return to the Exchequer.  Various reports were submitted by those consultants from December 1988 onwards.</P>
    <P>They advised that the Department invite offers by tender for the sale of the land in April 1990. Detailed assessments of the property were carried out by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the consultants to evaluate a fair market price for the property.  Based on the GSI assessment and taking into account an estimate of the capitalisation discounted royalties for the 20 year life of the deposit the consultants valued the property at £1.23 million with planning permission and £821,000 without.</P>
    <P>However, following an offer for the property by Roadstone Ltd.  the consultants subsequently advised in October 1990 that it would be most unlikely that any other party would be able to match this offer and strongly recommended that the sale be pursued.  The then Minister for Energy accepted that advice and the land was not advertised for public sale.  The consultants' view was that the Roadstone offer would represent a very satisfactory outcome and that it would be unlikely that any other potential buyer would match or exceed the offer considering the planning difficulties to be faced and the strategic advantages which undoubtedly favoured Roadstone as an adjoining property owner.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that the planning difficulties in regard to the site anticipated by the consultants in 1990 have come to pass as reflected in the recent decision of An Bord Pleanála to refuse planning permission for the company to begin quarrying on these lands.  Following subsequent negotiations with the company an improved offer of £1.25 million without planning permission was made.  In accordance with the guidelines on the disposal of Government property where a sale is not conducted by public tender or auction the sanction of the Department of Finance to the sale of the lands to Roadstone other than by public tender was sought and obtained in December 1990 after which the offer was accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> The price paid by the company was substantially in excess of the expert valuation secured by the Department of Energy.  The Department's files indicate that a number of parties expressed interest in the lands prior to the decision to dispose of the lands to Roadstone.  It is not clear from the records available to what extent consideration was given to notifying other interested parties that it was proposed to dispose of the property and that the manner of disposal would be by private treaty subject to satisfactory terms being negotiated.  However, it can be inferred that having formed the view that the Roadstone offer was likely to be the best available the judgment was made that such notification was not warranted.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out, as was indicated by the former Minister, Deputy Yates in May 1997, that the only other firm offer on the table when negotiations with Roadstone were in progress was significantly lower and was not therefore accepted. I and my Department would be happy to co-operate with any examination that the House may wish to carry out and to facilitate the Committee of Public Accounts in any such examination.  The matter was previously considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies and its chairman, former Deputy Kavanagh. He held an investigation into the matter, perhaps of a limited nature, because it is such an extensive matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to warn the House that the impending closure of Ferbane power station is of the utmost gravity to all concerned.  Such a closure will lead to the loss of between 300 and 350 jobs in the ESB and Bord an Móna, which will affect the entire county of Offaly.  The closure cannot, must not and will not be allowed by the people of Offaly.  They will fight to ensure this power station is kept open and the £16 million refurbishment work is done.</P>
      <P>It is imperative that the Minister intervenes in this matter immediately, speaks to the ESB and directs the company to make a further determined effort to resolve this matter and not to act in such a precipitous manner as to close this station.  The House will be aware that the board of the ESB will meet in the middle of October when management will propose the closure of the station.  The ESB and the unions must make a further effort to resolve the few remaining difficulties which are preventing this work proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the MSF union must separate theory from hard facts.  Mr. Joe Bowers, regional manager of the MSF, stated that talks were expected to continue until April 1999.  This investment cannot be allowed to be delayed for that length of time.  I call on Mr. Bowers to realise that many peoples' livelihoods hang on the decision to proceed with this investment.  Ferbane should be <Col N="300" /> treated on a stand alone basis and ring fenced.  I call on the MSF union also to allow the station to be treated as a special case so that work can continue.  The outstanding difficulties in other stations should not be allowed to intervene in the difficulties at Ferbane.  Council representation in this electoral area has been reduced from five to four and there is considerable unemployment.  If that station were to close everyone in the surrounding area would be affected by it.  I believe the three MSF workers, the other unions and management would comply with any agreement reached.  It is essential that Ferbane power station is saved and I ask the Minister to use her good offices to ensure it is.</P>
    <P>The local papers reported this week that the ESB is seeking further job losses and redundancies in Shannon Bridge and Rhode.  I am concerned that further job losses are envisaged across County Offaly.  Those employed by the ESB and Bord na Móna across the midlands have made many sacrifices.  They have suffered enough and should not be asked to suffer more.  Those two semi-States bodies have contributed a great deal to County Offaly.  I ask the Minister to try to ensure that the future viability of these stations is guaranteed and that there will not be further job losses as threatened during the talks.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister will meet members of Offaly County Council later this week.  I thank her for her courtesy in dealing with this matter.  I call on her to try to ensure that the Ferbane power station is kept open.  I will co-operate with her, the ESB and the MSF in any way I can to try to save those jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Enright for the courageous way he spelt out the position.  It is not often in Dáil Éireann or outside it that one hears the facts of a case.  I know this is not the first occasion on which he has raised this matter in the House.  He has tabled questions on it and raised it in other ways.  My Cabinet colleague, Deputy Cowen, and I discussed this matter over several months, throughout the difficulties that ensued and during a time when we thought the matter would be settled but it was not.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that for the past 40 years Ferbane power station has been critical to the economic life of west Offaly.  That number of years is roughly the length of the normal life of a power station.  A feasibility study managed by a steering group comprising representatives of the Department, the ESB, Bord na Móna and the other concerned groups was carried out on the station during 1995-6.  It was finalised on 31 May 1996 and it concluded that the refurbishment of Unit 4 at Ferbane and its operation with competitive manning levels was the best way forward.  The ESB board endorsed the findings of the study and decided to proceed with the refurbishment.  We know about the directive that will come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the announcement of the refurbishment <Col N="301" /> work nearly two years ago the ESB concluded the necessary tendering process for the procurement of works and equipment.  Issues concerning the recovery of costs have also been agreed with my Department.  However, it has not been possible to reach agreement with a small number of the workforce at Ferbane to implement the changes agreed in the CCR, a key condition of the ESB board.</P>
    <P>ESB management notified the station's workforce on 24 September that in the absence of an agreement with all the staff it could not proceed with the refurbishment.  Mr. Dalton travelled to the station and said on that occasion that a recommendation would be put to the board at the next meeting.  I met Mr. Dalton on Monday morning in my office and we discussed the matter at length.  During the summer I met representatives of the unions formally in Dublin and informally each weekend at home in Athlone, mostly on a Saturday and sometimes on a Sunday with the exception of the two weeks I took holidays.</P>
    <P>In my public life dealing with matters or being on the periphery when somebody else was dealing with a case, I have never experienced the difficulties that are arising in this case.  However, I am optimistic by nature, I believe all is not lost and that the closure of the station is not inevitable. Why should it be?  Why should this threat hang over a lovely, lively and bustling town like Ferbane?  The town deserves the investment promised by the ESB, but it cannot proceed unless it gets what was signed for in the CCR. The majority of the staff are prepared to implement the changes agreed and I call on the remainder to also agree to the necessary changes. That is all that is required.  Such a move is in the best interest of the local community in Ferbane which is so dependent on the ESB and Bord na Móna for its economic well-being.  I understand the chairman of the ESB Joint Industrial Council has invited the relevant unions involved and the ESB management to a meeting tomorrow to discuss the issue and we all await the outcome of those deliberations.</P>
    <P>I hope all the parties involved will act in a straightforward and open manner and that they will urgently seek to try to reconcile their differences. As we approach the next millennium, it is amazing that there is such an impasse.  The investment of £16 million in the station would guarantee its future for up to 20 years and provide direct and ancillary employment for many families.  That would make such a difference to Ferbane, which none of us wants to see sunk in gloom and depression as it is at present.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's input into this debate.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Cowen, and I will continue to discuss this case.  I welcome the bi-partisan support in dealing with it.  Senator Gallagher has also talked to me and has been active in lending his support.  I know Offaly County Council met yesterday.  I telephoned the chairman this morning and asked him to convey that I would be pleased to meet the members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> Our only chance is to be united in our solidarity. We want the investment to be made.  We appreciate that the ESB cannot make that investment until the outstanding issues related to the CCR, to which the workforce have signed and agreed, are satisfactorily dealt with.  I hope and pray that in the immediate days ahead there will be a reasonable resolution of what seems to be an intractable problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo):</i> A total of 331 people died on our roads this year.  Based on that figure the gloomy prediction must be that at least another 100 people, who are alive, active and healthy tonight, will not live to enjoy Christmas 1998; they will die on our roads.  According to Dublin Corporation's road safety plan, 2,480 people were injured in Dublin last year.  In spite of the carnage of the previous two weeks 14 people died on our roads in the past seven days.  The reality is that the vast majority of those accidents and, consequently, those deaths could have been avoided.</P>
      <P>Road safety and road traffic policies are not working.  While I welcomed the initiative launched by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government a number of weeks ago, it is not working.  I welcome initiatives such as Operation Lifesaver.  In spite of the clamp-down by the Garda in the pilot project area in question, 37,000 speeding offences were detected in a three month period alone.  I welcome the promotional work done by the National Safety Authority and the research being done by Beaumont Hospital into age categories of accident prone drivers, but the message is not getting home and the slaughter continues unabated.</P>
      <P>From September 1997 to July 1998 the percentage of cars exceeding speed limits increased from 18 per cent to 28 per cent.  The percentage of trucks exceeding the 50 miles per mile inter-urban speed limit increased from 37 per cent in January to 42 per cent in March.  We have the statistics and we know the causes of the deaths &mdash; speed, drink, inexperienced drunk drivers, carelessness, recklessness and negligence.</P>
      <P>A multi-pronged approach is needed.  In terms of road deaths, the day of the pilot project is long gone.  The annual drop in the number of accidents and drink driving offences at Christmas shows clearly that intensified enforcement works.  The same level of intensive enforcement is needed not on a hit and miss basis, but all year round.  It is a crude analysis but it is a fact that the fear of being caught works when it comes to deterring people.</P>
      <P>To categorise as an accident a scene where gross negligence, speed, drink or so-called joyriding is the cause of death on the roads is a misnomer and trivialises what is manslaughter.  To charge somebody with dangerous driving, having through recklessness left a family without a father or a mother, is to minimise the offence and devalue it.  Manslaughter and attempted manslaughter should be the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> There is a need for the courts to disqualify people for speed limit excesses.  There is a need for insurance companies to refuse cover irrespective of how much one is willing, able or prepared to pay.  There is a need for the power of instant confiscation of vehicles for the Garda in certain situations.  There is a need to change the rules for the availability and retention of provisional licences.  It is ridiculous that of the 1.7 million drivers on our roads, 327,000 hold provisional licences.  There is a need for an attitude change. While one would like it to happen through public awareness, civic mindedness and education, if it means forcing an attitude change, then so be it.</P>
    <P>We introduced what was described as harsh and draconian legislation to deal with the aftermath of the horrors of the Omagh bomb.  This year already more than ten times more people have died on our roads than died in Omagh.  If draconian measures are required, we must not shirk this course of action.  Too many innocent victims have suffered.  The time for tough talking is over.  Tough, effective action is now required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for giving me this opportunity to outline the measures the Government is taking on this serious issue.  The Government is committed to reducing the unacceptable level of deaths and serious injury on our roads.  I assure the House that tackling the problem is a priority for the Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>I convey my sympathy to the families of the people who have died tragically on our roads this year and in the past.  A total of 332 people have been killed in road accidents to date compared to 344 in the comparable period last year.  While there is a slight reduction in the total, the figures are totally unacceptable.  When one remembers that 11,000 people suffered injuries in road accidents during 1997, it is clear that drastic action is necessary and I will set out the measures taken by the Government to deal with these issues.</P>
      <P>In response to the continuing high level of accidents the Taoiseach on 21 October 1997 called a meeting of the inter agency high level group on road safety, which operates under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and which includes representatives of my Department and the Garda Síochána.  This group was mandated to prepare a national strategy on road safety.  This strategy entitled &ldquo;The Road to Safety&rdquo;, was launched by the Taoiseach on 31 July 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal aim of the strategy is to reduce road fatalities by 2002 by a minimum of 20 per cent on their 1997 level and to achieve a similar reduction of at least 20 per cent in the number of serious injuries from road accidents.  This strategy is designed to improve our road safety record <i>vis-a-vis</i> our European partners, <Col N="304" /> Supporting targets of the strategy by 2002 are to reduce the incidence of excessive speed by 50 per cent from current levels, to increase the wearing rate of front and rear seat belts to at least 85 per cent, to reduce by 25 per cent the number of fatal road accidents, commonly drink related, occurring during the hours of darkness and to implement specific accident reduction measures at more than 400 national road locations.</P>
    <P>Speed and alcohol have been identified as the major causes of accidents.  Not wearing seat belts is also a contributory cause.  These offences are also the primary focus of Operation Lifesaver to which Deputy Higgins referred which was launched on 14 July 1997.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Garda is committed to vigorous enforcement of the speeding regulations. During 1997 the Garda issued 71,337 on the spot fines for speeding of which 58,458 were paid, that is, a 75 per cent rate of voluntary payment. There were 22,801 convictions for speeding in 1997.  One of the aims of the national strategy is to reduce incidences of excessive speeding by 50 per cent from current levels.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that alcohol is an important factor in up to 25 per cent of road accidents and 33 per cent of fatal accidents.  The enforcement of the drink driving laws are given a high priority by the Garda Síochána.  A total of 5,975 prosecutions were taken in respect of drink driving offences in 1996 and the total increased to 7,616 in 1997.</P>
    <P>Under the road safety strategy the Garda and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety are to work towards the phased introduction of evidential breath testing, which is allowed under the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  This will mean that persons will undergo a breath test at a Garda station instead of a blood and urine sample test following arrest for suspected drink driving.  It is expected that evidential breath testing will lead to an increase in convictions.</P>
    <P>Not wearing seat belts has also been identified as a major factor in road deaths and serious injury accidents.  The House may be assured that the enforcement of the seat belt regulations is also given a high priority by the Garda.  In 1997 there were 9,280 prosecutions for this offence compared to 6,293 in 1996.  In addition, as part of Operation Lifesaver, 48,848 seat belt offences were detected from 1 January 1998 to 16 August 1998.  In all these areas, the levels of detection and prosecution have increased.  The national strategy aims to increase seat belt wearing by car users to 85 per cent by 2002.  The strategy also envisages extending the on the spot fine system for failure to wear a seat belt.</P>
    <P>The Garda has confirmed that Operation Lifesaver, which was introduced in the Louth-Meath area in July 1997, will continue in 1999.  It was designed to increase the enforcement capacity of the Garda in relation to the key offences of excessive speed, drink driving and not wearing seat belts.</P>
    <P>The Garda has the necessary resources in terms <Col N="305" /> of manpower and equipment to help it in its road traffic enforcement role.  It has the most up to date speed detection technology.  The equipment in use in enforcing speed limits includes hand held radar, tripod mounted lasers, in-car video cameras as well as the GATSO unit, which, as Members are aware, is a mobile speed detection unit with on board cameras and computer facilities. The Garda has two of these units with a further three due to be delivered soon.  In addition, the provision of fixed speed cameras and the development of the penalty points system are an integral part of the national strategy on road safety.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the Government's commitment to reducing the levels of road deaths and serious injuries on our roads.  The House can be assured the Government is determined to make progress as set out in the national strategy.  The House may also be assured that the Garda is similarly committed. It will continue to use all available resources and to co-operate with all agencies involved to make our roads safer and to reduce the number of deaths and injuries.  However, it must be stressed that additional resources and enforcement alone cannot succeed unless the public makes a serious effort to obey the law. There were more than 250,000 prosecutions for road traffic offences during 1997 and this sends a clear message about our observance of these laws. As Deputy Higgins said, perhaps an attitude change is required.  Undoubtedly, the laws are there to be obeyed and it is in everyone's interest in terms of safety on our roads to play our part.</P>

      <P>This debate is opportune.  Earlier today the president of the USI, Mr. Dermot Lohan, and members of its executive who are in the public galllery, lobbied Deputies on the serious matter of the hardship caused for thousands of young students by the inadequacy of maintenance grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that the rainbow coalition Government introduced free tuition fees for all third level students in 1995 it is becoming increasingly difficult for many parents to send their children to third level colleges because of high rental accommodation costs and the increased cost of living.  According to the USI poverty survey for 1997-98 it costs a student from outside Dublin £466.24 per month to live and study in the city. This will increase to at least £550 per month or £137.50 per week for the 1998-99 academic year because of the spiralling cost of accommodation which works out at between £50 and £55 per week on average and the increased cost of living, including travelling expenses, college book fees, <Col N="306" /> food, clothes, course materials and other essential items.  The total cost to parents to send their children to university in Dublin, based on a 36-week year, is now in the region of £5,000.  Traditionally, UCD and Trinity College have attracted large numbers of Kerry students.  I can see this tradition dying because of parents' inability to pay.</P>
    <P>The maximum maintenance grant is £1,652 and is paid to students whose parents earn less than £18,308 and have three children.  A family earning more than £19,525 with fewer than four children receives no assistance.  The burden on low income families and those on social welfare is particularly onerous.  The maximum maintenance grant is hopelessly inadequate and meets only 33 per cent of actual living costs for 1998-99.  Many students may be forced to abandon third level education as a result.</P>
    <P>Professor Pat Clancy of UCD found that students' chances of attending college depend on their socio-economic background.  In his publication, Access to College &mdash; Patterns of Continuity and Change, he shows that students whose parents are classed as higher professionals are six times more likely to attend college than students whose parents are classed as semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers. Speaking recently at the conferral ceremony in Dublin City University the president of the college said that he was ashamed to admit that universities in Ireland were still almost exclusively for the relatively well off.  There are approximately 6,000 students in full-time third level education from semi-skilled or unskilled manual worker backgrounds.  They are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet and survive on the paltry maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>There have been many calls for radical reform of the maintenance grants scheme.  In 1994 the Higher Education Authority steering committee on the future of third level education recommended that the adjacent rate should be increased to £1,500 and the non-adjacent rate to £3,000.  Many middle and lower income families are unable to send their children to college.  The recommendations of the Butler committee should be implemented.  Accommodation should also be provided on campus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Maintenance grants need to be increased dramatically if we are to encourage young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend third level.  CIE is proposing to increase its charges while it costs up to £80 per week to stay in digs in Dublin.  It costs young people more than £5,000 on average to live in Dublin.  The maintenance grant meets only a small percentage of this. Income limits must also be increased.  They were increased by 77p per week in the budget.  This did not match inflation.  If we are serious about developing our economy we must look seriously at the maintenance grants system.</P>

    <P>The higher education grants scheme with the vocational education scholarship scheme and the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme comprise the third level maintenance grants schemes.  Sixty per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.  In the 1996-97 academic year almost 48,000 students received grants under these schemes at a cost of £91 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of the third level maintenance grants schemes.  It has been the practice in recent years to increase maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index.  The inflation figure provided by the Central Statistics Office for the period mid-February 1997 to mid-February 1998 was 1.7 per cent.  The value of the maintenance grant was therefore increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-99 academic year.</P>
    <P>It has also been the practice in recent years to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The figures provided by the Central Statistics Office are computed in each case to March of the previous year.  The average industrial wage increase for the period March 1996 to March 1997 was 3.2 per cent.  The reckonable income limits for the 1998-99 academic year were therefore increased by 3.2 per cent.  This increase was also applied to the allowance by which the income limits may be increased in respect of other family members pursuing a course of study.  The definition of eligible courses has also been extended to include those family members attending a recognised PLC course, student nurse training, student Garda <Col N="308" /> training, those participating in certain CERT courses and those attending full-time Teagasc courses in an agricultural college.  In each such case the reckonable income limits are increased by £2,060.  The full maintenance grant for the current academic year has been increased to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £660 at the adjacent rate.</P>
    <P>Our priority in relation to student support has been to honour the commitment given in the Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to introduce equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  We have honoured that commitment by way of introducing a maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  The scheme was issued to vocational education committees in August and it is anticipated that the first payment to students, which will be retrospective to September, will be made not later than January next.  The grants payable under this scheme will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>We are committed to ongoing improvements to the third level student support schemes, including increasing the value of maintenance grants and income limits as resources permit.  The Deputies will appreciate that such improvements must have regard to overall resource constraints and competing demands in the third level sector.  In this regard the creation of additional places at third level is critical.  We have increased the number of places significantly and will continue to do so, particularly in the context of skills shortages to ensure that those who attend third level will virtually be guaranteed a job.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.  The record of my party in investing in education will be maintained in perpetuity.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 October 1998.</P>

      <P>In the context of developing proposals for inclusion in Ireland's application for post-1999 EU funding, CIE recently submitted to my Department a review which it carried out of its bus and rail transport investment needs in the greater Cork area.  This submission is currently being considered by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance which has the lead role in the preparation of the overall application.  That Department will also be engaging in a consultative process with the regional authorities and the social partners before finalising Ireland's application to the European Commission.</P>

      <Quest>the resources, if any, she has made available to Bus Atha Cliath to provide more buses at the same time as the new quality bus corridors will come into operation; the number of additional buses proposed; when they will be delivered; and the future assessment of additional buses to be made available.</Quest>

      <P>As part of the reallocation of the Luas EU assistance, approval has been given for the acquisition by Bus Átha Cliath of an additional 50 buses at a total cost of £8.5 million. These buses, which are expected to be delivered in autumn 1999, will be used on the quality bus corridors and will increase morning rush hour capacity by 3,500.  This is the first occasion on which we have succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the European Commission to co-finance the purchase of buses.  The balance of the funding for the acquisition of these buses is to be provided by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In line with the DTO Short Term Action Plan, Bus Átha Cliath will also acquire, from its own resources, over 120 double decker buses in 1998 and 1999 to replace an equivalent number of old single decker and double decker buses.  This will increase capacity by some 2,450 passenger trips.</P>
      <P>In addition to these measures the DTO Short Term Action Plan has identified a requirement for 100 extra buses and the need for additional State subvention to support expanded peak hour bus services.  These recommendations will be considered by Government as part of the Estimates and budget process.</P>
      <P>The action plan also proposes that Bus Átha Cliath subcontract some school bus services.  This would release buses for use in the morning peak commuter services and provide capacity for an extra 4,200 passenger trips.  This measure is part of the wider restructuring negotiations and these proposals are being considered by the Labour Court at present.</P>
      <P>The various initiatives to increase bus capacity are being taken in tandem with the acceleration of the quality bus corridor network.  This network will be extended to 12 routes with the addition of a QBC to Ballymun.  Additional funding of over £9.4 million as part of the reallocation of the Luas aid means that approximately £12 million will be allocated in DTO traffic management grants in 1999 and 2000 for the implementation of QBCs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75, 93, 107, 111 and 275 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> Deputies will be aware that, in 1997, my predecessor mandated the board of Aer Lingus to explore the possibility of entering into a major strategic alliance, with or without equity, and to submit proposals to the shareholder.</P>
    <P>On Friday 4 September 1998 I received a report from the executive chairman of Aer Lingus in response to that mandate.</P>
    <P>Having examined a number of strategic options, Aer Lingus concluded that the commercial future of the airline could only be secured through participation in a major strategic alliance, of which a strong US partner would be a key component.</P>
    <P>I submitted that report to Government on Tuesday 8 September 1998 which agreed that it should be published.  All Members of the</P>
    <P>Oireachtas received a copy and it was freely distributed to staff representatives, the media and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>Arising from their consideration of that report, the Government agreed, in principle, that Aer Lingus should seek a partner, that the partnership could be equity based and that the process could move to the next stage.</P>
    <P>The current position is that the executive chairman of Aer Lingus will undertake discussions over the coming weeks and months with prospective partners and he will report back to me on developments from time to time, on an interim basis.  He has told me however, that this stage could take up to six months.  Depending on the outcome, there will be a number of issues which will fall to be considered in detail.  These could include the way in which the proceeds of any equity sale, if the Government were to decide on such a course, would be utilised.</P>
    <P>It is much too soon to speculate on the outcome of the next phase and all the issues that may or may not arise.  I assure the House there will be careful and detailed consideration and consultation in order to ensure the best outcome for the airline, its employees and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There is no intention of sacrificing Shannon Airport's transatlantic operations to achieve a strategic alliance for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Since I received the report I have had the following meetings: on Tuesday 8 September 1998 following a ceremony to mark the commencement of work on a £40 million extension to the terminal buildings at Shannon, I met signal representatives in Shannon to discuss their specific concerns about the report; on Wednesday 9 September 1998 I met the chairman and senior executives of Aer Lingus to advise on the Government decision and to agree a way forward; and on Wednesday, 16 September 1998, I met the Aer Lingus Central Representative Council.  I assured it this process would be conducted on the basis of the partnership approach that is already established in Aer Lingus, that its concerns would be taken on board throughout the process and that I would be available to meet it as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 92 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>Because the link between duty free facilities and transport is significant, and all the more so in the case of Ireland, I, as Minister for Public Enterprise, will continue my endeavours to raise the profile of the duty free facilities issue at home and abroad and to press for an open-ended deferral at every possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>Last Monday I met my French counterpart, Mr. Jean-Claud Gayssot, in Dublin to discuss the options in relation to the planned abolition of duty-free sales at the end of June 1999.</P>
      <P>The French Transport Minister provided me with a copy of the recently completed study of the impact of the abolition of duty-free sales in France.  The study was carried out by Mr. André Capet, Deputy for the Calais region.  Mr. Capet visited me in June of this year when he was researching his report.  The report concludes that the abolition would have a major impact on French aviation and airports, the maritime sector and on the cognac, champagne and perfume manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has written to the French Prime Minister, M. Lionel Jospin, suggesting that the Capet report could provide a basis for a series of options for action on the duty free facilities issue.</P>
      <P>At the European level the European Commission is preparing a report on the possible mechanisms and aids to counter the negative economic effects of the abolition of duty free sales.  This report will be tabled at a future ECOFIN meeting where my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will have an opportunity, once more, to put forward the Irish case for deferral of the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we approach the countdown to June 1999 neither myself nor the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, will be found wanting in our efforts to pursue the case at every possible opportunity, particularly in our endeavours to convince the <Col N="314" /> larger member states to take up the running.  This is now the key requirement.  Ireland has brought the proposed abolition of duty free sales onto the agenda of the European Council, the larger member states need to come forward and actively carry the campaign to a positive conclusion. Ireland cannot do it alone.</P>

      <P>The procurement processes of all State bodies are subject to the EU Public Procurement Directives, which set out detailed rules on the procurement of goods and services.  State bodies in the energy, transport and telecommunications sectors are subject to special procurement directives &mdash; the &ldquo;Utilities Directives&rdquo;&mdash; which recognise the commercial character of their operations.  The actual implementarion of the directives, and the purchasing arrangements <Col N="317" /> for goods and services adopted, are matters for the individual bodies themselves.</P>
      <P>It is a basic principle of public procurement policy that a procedure based on competitive tendering should always be used.  The directives preclude any form of regional or national preference which is discriminatory or anti-competitive.</P>
      <P>However in certain circumstances special preferences may be taken into account in the execution of a contract but only where they do not breach Community legislation or the principles of the Treaty of Rome.</P>

      <P>I announced on 25 June a £63 million Dublin suburban rail and DART improvement package, arising from the reallocation of the EU assistance decommitted from the Luas project.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Maynooth corridor, the measures now being funded from the decommitted EU aid include: the provision of extra suburban railcars which will allow two additional services on the Maynooth line during morning and evening peak times; station platform lengthening to accommodate longer trains which will increase the passenger carrying capacity of the line and the doubling of the track between Clonsilla and Maynooth and resignalling of the Maynooth line which will facilitate the additional train services in morning and evening peak times.</P>
      <P>In the short-term, Iarnród Éireann has advised that new railcars, expected to arrive in October of this year, will replace outdated carriages and provide a much needed increase in passenger carrying capacity.  Early next year, the company will review the timetable with a view to increasing the frequency of the trains, especially during peak hours.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has also advised me that a comprehensive engineering assessment of the line between Maynooth and the city centre has been completed.  Design work has commenced and drawings are being prepared for the station improvements and the necessary trackwork.</P>

      <P>A feasibility study carried out during 1995 and 1996 examined the question of building a new peat fired power station in west Offaly.  The study was managed by a steering group chaired by a senior officer of my Department with representatives of ESB, Bord na Móna, Offaly County Enterprise Board, and local employees from Bord na Móna and ESB.</P>
      <P>The group examined a number of options, including the building of a new 30MW station on a green field site, a new station on the existing Ferbane site, and/or the refurbishment of one or more of the existing units.</P>
      <P>The main conclusion of the study, finalised on 31 May 1996, was that the refurbishment of the 30MW unit at Ferbane, and its operation with competitive manning levels, was the best of the options available.</P>
      <P>The refurbishment would ensure the continued generation of electricity at Ferbane, thus sustaining employment in the station and on the bogs supplying it.  The boards of both Bord na Móna and ESB endorsed the report.</P>
      <P>Competitive manning levels and new work practices are vital to the future of Ferbane as the ESB face into competition under the new Electricity Directive.  The necessary changes were an integral part of the CCR agreement and were agreed both nationally and locally.  Unfortunately, it has not proved possible to reach agreement with some of the workforce to implement the relevant changes already agreed in the CCR.</P>
      <P>The management of ESB, therefore, notified the station workforce on 24 September that it could not proceed with refurbishment of the station in the circumstances.  I understand that a recommendation for closure of the station at an early date will be put to the ESB board at its meeting on 16 October 1998.</P>
      <P>I now understand the ESB Joint Industrial Council has invited all the parties involved to a meeting tomorrow, 1 October, and the outcome of that meeting will be awaited with interest.</P>

      <P>The route from Belfast to Dublin and Cork has been included as part of the Trans European Network.  This decision facilitated the approval of EU funding as a result of which the Belfast to Dublin line has benefited from a major investment programme which includes the upgrading of track to continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, major infrastructure works, signalling upgrade and rolling stock replacement. This investment programme, costing approximately £124 million, of which about £66 million has been spent on the southern section of the line, received financial assistance from both the European Regional Development Fund and from the Cohesion Fund.  Work is now complete on the southern side of the Border.  As a result of this investment the new Enterprise service was officially launched on 21 October 1997.</P>
      <P>The Dublin to Cork line has likewise benefited from substantial EU co-financed investment.  The line has received aid of £10.2 million from the Structural Fund 1993-99.  By the end of next year the complete line will have been upgraded to continuous welded rail.</P>
      <P>The services on this route operate between Belfast and Dublin, Connolly and from Dublin, Heuston to Cork.  The provision of services is a matter for the transport companies but there are no proposals to provide a high speed train service from Belfast through to Cork.  However, the option of upgrading the link between Connolly and Heuston stations is being kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 88, 98, 102, 109 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the extended light rail project approved by Government includes two lines: Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport.  The estimated cost of this phase is in excess of £400 million and when further detailed technical work has been carried out a firm cost estimate will be available.</P>
      <P>The two lines are the first phase of a longer term vision for an extended network serving destinations such as Swords, Docklands, Cabinteely, Clondalkin and Finglas.  As no formal Government decision has yet been taken in respect of these further phases it is premature to comment on their cost.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the necessary finance is availale to implement the approved project.  Funding for the project in 1999 and subsequent years will be addressed as part of the normal budgetary process when Government prepares its annual public capital programme. The light rail project will also be submitted for EU assistance under the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consultants commissioned by the Department of Finance, to analyse the possibilities for publicprivate partnerships in Ireland, recommended that a pilot approach to PPPs should be adopted and this was accepted by the Government.  The <Col N="323" /> consultants made a general suggestion that a section of the Dublin light rail project could be considered as a possible pilot project.  I will shortly be appointing consultants to advise on a PPP approach to the light rail project.</P>
    <P>On 20 August last, I had a meeting with representatives from Mitsui and Co. , the Nishimatsu Construction Co. , and the Unified Proposal in relation to possible private participation in the implementation of the light rail scheme.  At that meeting I outlined the Government's decision in relation to public private partnerships and I made it clear that any PPP approach to the LRT project would be on an open and transparent basis and would include a public procurement process for the selection of a private partner.  Mr. Kelly, Mr. Kurihara and Mr. Kato represented Mitsui.  Mr. Sugiyama and Mr. Fisher represented Nishimatsu. Mr. Rabbitt, Mr. Monaghan and Mr. Lonergan represented the Unified Proposal.  On Friday 25 September I also met Mr. Chris Larsen and Vice President Halmar in relation to the issue of PPPs.</P>
    <P>On the matter of a timetable for the commencement and completion of the project, I will not tie myself or the Government to a timescale at this stage, when the project is still subject to <Col N="324" /> the relevant statutory approval procedures and to necessary detailed technical evaluation work.  For the information of the Deputies following is a tabular statement setting out an indicative timetable for the various elements of the project.  The target dates are subject to satisfactory completion of the necessary statutory procedures and to the necessary technical evaluations.</P>
    <P>In relation to geological surveys and other such issues it is a matter for the CIE light rail project team to implement the technical work programme necessary to give effect to the Government's decision and it is not a matter in respect of which I have any function.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Luas indicative timetable, a preliminary estimate of the timescales involved in implementing the Government's objective of proceeding without delay with the construction of the Tallaght-City Centre section and, subject to the necessary technical confirmation, with the Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green section, is shown below.  Indications are also given of the work programme in respect of the extension from St. Stephen's Green to Ballymun and Dublin Airport using the old Broadstone railway alignment and with an underground section in the City Centre.

      <P>In the light of the <Col N="325" /> accelerating demand for natural gas, a study is being jointly undertaken by my Department and Bord Gáis Éireann of natural gas demand and infrastructure requirements to the year 2025.  The objective of this study is to determine the optimal long-term transmission infrastructure necessary to meet gas demand projections, taking into account the various gas demand scenarios that might develop.  The study is not yet fully completed.</P>
      <P>A technical engineering study undertaken by external consultants to identify the main gas infrastructural options needed has just been received and is being examined by my Department and BGE.  However various commercial, financial and economic evaluations have yet to be undertaken.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, an extension of the network from Dublin to Galway and south to Limerick is not economic without the assistance of Exchequer funding of the order of £60 million. However, I will examine this project, in consultation with BGE, having regard to the completion of the various studies and evaluations.</P>
      <P>No provision has been made for Exchequer funding in 1999 for this project.</P>

      <P>I am informed by Aer Lingus that the sale of TEAM Aer Lingus to FLS Aerospace is expected to be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of TEAM employees have now accepted terms for the transfer of their employment to FLS Aerospace.  These terms <Col N="326" /> encompass the matters referred to by Deputy Yates in his question such as employee rights within the new company, pension arrangements and transfer payments.  Arrangements for the treatment of TEAM's current debt position will be part of the terms of the general sale agreement between Aer Lingus and FLS Aerospace.</P>
    <P>As regards TEAM employees who have not yet accepted the terms on offer, I am informed that Aer Lingus has assessed their skills and is now in the process of attempting to match those skills with the opportunities that are available in the airline.</P>
    <P>Those opportunities are, however, limited and depending on the number of TEAM employees who ultimately decline to accept the terms on offer, it may not be possible to accommodate all of them within Aer Lingus; in that event, negotiations will be necessary between the workers concerned and Aer Lingus management in order to find a resolution.</P>
    <P>Pending completion of the sale process, I am not in a position to comment in any detail on precise terms of the sale some of which will, in any event, be commercially confidential.</P>

    <P>The committee also includes representatives from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Attorney General's office and officials from various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The committee has adopted a work programme encompassing a wide range of nuclear safety and radiological protection issues, including the campaign against Sellafield.

    <P>Over the coming months, in addition to issues directly relating to the Government's ongoing campaign against Sellafield and the UK nuclear industry generally, the committee's work programme will include a review of the National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents; discussion on radon-related matters; issues arising in regard to the County Louth Residents' legal action against British Nuclear Fuels and a review of progress in regard to implementation of the EU Basic Safety Standards Directive on the protection of workers and the general public against the dangers of ionising radiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 130 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>The trend across the European Union has been towards road freight transport.  This has been driven more by the speed and flexibility of this mode rather than by the impact of liberalisation in the road transport sector.</P>
      <P>In Ireland there are a number of additional factors which militate against significant growth in the railway's share of the freight market.  International experience suggests that rail freight comes into its own for journeys in excess of 200 kilometers and very few freight journeys in Ireland would exceed that length.  There are also areas which are geographically remote from a railhead.  Ireland's island status and the absence of a fixed link to mainland Europe makes railbased combined transport a less effective option than in the rest of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> Notwithstanding these constraints, the railway still has approximately a 10 per cent share of the overall freight market in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Policies are being pursued by the EU aimed at counteracting the negative environmental impact of road freight transport and promoting the increased use of rail freight and combined transport. These policies include a balanced mix of measures aimed at improved vehicle design, fuel efficiencies, transport logistics and information systems.  They also include the liberalisation of the rail freight market and the internalisation of the external costs of transport.</P>
    <P>Ireland adopts a constructive approach to legislative and policy measures proposed by the Commission in these areas, but we also have to ensure that the implementation of these measures does not adversely impact on the competitiveness of our economy.  Because of our peripheral location, the length of journeys to our main export markets, our dependence on sea and air access transport and the fact that rail is often not a viable alternative for many businesses, we have to pay particular attention to the impact of EU proposals on transport costs.</P>
    <P>The annual State subvention to CIE covers the entire expenditure on rail infrastructure as well as contributing to railway operating costs.  Consequently rail freight is not at a disadvantage due to the need to cover infrastructure costs.</P>
    <P>On the question of transporting mineral ores and other freight by rail, I should explain that this is an operational issue for Iarnród Éireann, taking into account commercial and other considerations. I have no statutory function in this area. In view of the environmental benefits I would, in general, be in favour of an increase in the share of the freight market held by the railways provided it can be done on a commercial basis without distortion of competition in the freight market and without adversely affecting the competitive position of Irish industry.  The EU proposal to establish a common infrastructure charging framework is aimed at eliminating competitive distortions between transport modes and there are, therefore, no plans to subsidise rail freight.</P>
    <P>The issues regarding rail freight addressed in the document &ldquo;A New Minerals Policy&rdquo; relate to the potential to alleviate potential adverse impacts on the environment due to road carriage of minerals.  I have no doubt that these matters are fully considered by local authorities during the planning approval process.</P>

      <P>I should point out that my concerns about the storage of High Level Waste at Sellafield have been conveyed to the UK Authorities on a number of occasions.  In recent correspondence with the UK Minister for Energy, Mr. John Battle, MP, I called for the vitrification programme to be accelerated to facilitate a much earlier target date than 2015 for the clearance of the backlog of the waste.</P>
      <P>Up to now, BNFL has refused to release publicly probabilistic risk assessment on grounds of commercial confidentiality.  I have written to UK Ministers in support of the RPII's request for access to the probabilistic assessments.  Since then the RPII has been in discussions with BNFL about alternative means of reassuring the RPII about safety standards which would overcome BNFL's misgivings about commercial confidentiality. To date these contacts have not yet concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104, 116, 117 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta faces significant challenges in the years immediately ahead.  It faces heavy demands on its resources arising from the formidable but necessary capital programme currently proposed for the three State airports.  I am aware that to take advantage of international investment opportunities in airports and airport related business, where Aer Rianta has demonstrated special abilities in the past, substantial funds will be required.  All this will place a heavy strain on the finances of this successful company.</P>
      <P>There are, moreover, major changes taking place in the markets in which all State companies under my aegis operate.  In light of this, it is now appropriate to undertake a fundamental review of the future development of the company.  This is why I wrote to the Chairman on 11 August last and asked the board to give serious consideration to the full range of future development options, which present themselves.  I have specifically asked the board of Aer Rianta to reflect on what might be the most appropriate strategic direction for Aer Rianta in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>My view is that we need to take an open and pragmatic approach to the question of the best way forward for all the commercial State companies operating under my aegis, including Aer Rianta.  I am satisfied that Aer Rianta has, in the past, faced complex challenges and proven itself to be a vibrant and successful operator, both at home and abroad and I am fully confident that the board of the company can now address new challenges with the same openness and energy.  In requesting the board to conduct the review, I have not attempted to influence their deliberations in any way, nor have I ruled any future development options in or out.  I am aware that the board has commenced the review in partnership with staff in line with the spirit of co-operation integral to Aer Rianta's Compact for Constructive Participation and I fully endorse this approach.</P>
      <P>I would expect Aer Rianta to be in a position to report to me with the results of its review within six months.  Ultimately, any decision about the future of Aer Rianta will be one for Government to take, following a recommendation by myself.  It would not be helpful or appropriate for me to speculate at this point as to the likely outcome of the review.</P>

The draft final report of this group was submitted to my Department in December 1997.  It concluded against a rail link to the Dublin-Belfast line for operational and capacity reasons and instead proposed a diesel rail link to the Sligo line at a capital cost of £140 million.  The report also identified a number of matters which required further evaluation. One of the matters requiring further evaluation is the traffic inter-relationship between this rail link and the planned light rail line to the airport.</P>

      <P>I have had this matter examined by my Department and that examination has included consultation with the European Commission.  The envelope of European Regional Development Fund aid currently available to Ireland in the 1993-9 round of EU funding is set out in the Community Support Framework agreement between the European Commission and Ireland.  The funding priorities for each of the sectors is prescribed in the individual operational programmes.  None of the operational programmes which form part of the Community Framework for Ireland for 1993-9 contain any European Regional Development Fund provision for development of the gas infrastructure.  By contrast, the EU aid allocation for Spain for 1993-9 does contain an aid provision for the development of gas infrastructure.</P>

      <P>Record economic growth has fuelled an unprecedented demand for electricity with the result that new generating capacity is expected to be needed by late 2001 or early 2002.</P>
      <P>The current legal situation is that the ESB requires my approval under the Electricity Supply Acts for capital expenditure on any new plant. Private sector companies, on the other hand, wishing to enter the market in competition with ESB require a permit from ESB under the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  ESB is, therefore, currently in the position of operating in the market and at the same time regulating the entry of competitors. I have been advised by the Attorney General to introduce a Bill to establish an independent regulatory commission to oversee the electricity sector.</P>
      <P>The new EU Electricity Directive, which came into force in February 1997, must be implemented in Ireland by February 2000.  This directive requires that 28 per cent of the electricity market must be open to competition by then.</P>
      <P>I recently announced that the Government had approved the drafting of the necessary Bill to establish an independent regulatory commission. I hope that this Commission will be in place by early next year.</P>

      <P>The objective of the new protocol is to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing Safeguards Agreement entered into following on from the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.  The existing agreement is implemented by the International Atomic Energy Agency as part of an international effort to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to provide assurances about the peaceful use of nuclear materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new protocol extends the scope of the existing agreement to include specified equipment <Col N="337" /> and non-nuclear materials of a dual-use capability, i.e. civil or military.  Under the protocol, contracting parties will be obliged to furnish information to the IAEA on the manufacture and export of components and equipment used in the civil nuclear industry that could potentially be used to manufacture nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The discovery earlier in the decade of progress made by Iraq and North Korea towards developing nuclear weapons demonstrated to the international community that the existing safeguards regime had been insufficient to detect violations.  It raised serious questions about the credibility of the IAEA safeguards system.  The response of the international community was to design a future IAEA safeguards system, which would both strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the existing regime, the so-called 93+2 programme.</P>
    <P>The protocol signed in Vienna last week by Ireland and the other non-nuclear weapons states of the EU is modelled on this new system and is consistent with the aims of Irish policy.  Ireland strongly supported efforts to improve and reinforce the existing safeguards programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards my plans for Shannon Airport, the first need is to support the growth of Shannon and this requires ongoing investment in airport facilities.  Earlier this month I laid the foundation stone for a new terminal building at Shannon which is part of a £40 million investment by Aer Rianta aimed at doubling the existing capacity of the departures terminal, improving access to the airport and numerous other improvements to the facilities.</P>
      <P>The second need is to provide the widest possible range of air services.  Only last Friday I announced the establishment of the headquarters of Virgin Express (Ireland) Ltd.  at the airport and its plans for twice daily flights, including a 7 a.m. early morning departure to London/Stansted, which will meet a long-standing demand from the business community.  This latest announcement comes on top of a string of new services launched from Shannon over the past year, including Continental to Newark and AB airlines to Birmingham and Stansted.  Polar Air Cargo began cargo services to New York and Chicago last May, to add to the San Francisco and Chicago routes of Lufthansa and Cargolux which commenced less than a year ago.</P>
      <P>I also announced the proposed relocation by Royal Jordanian Airlines of its European hub to Shannon.  When fully relocated, Royal Jordanian will operate, through Shannon during the peak season, seven return flights per week to New York and three flights to Chicago, with an additional weekly freight service between Amman and New York.  As a further incentive to relocate, I have agreed to grant Royal Jordanian local pick-up rights at Shannon for each of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shannon Airport can best support the needs of the west and mid-west regions by providing a key infrastructural asset which contributes positively to meeting all the air transport needs of the region, not just in respect of tourism but also to <Col N="339" /> service the ever growing demand from the business community, and to cater for the rapidly increasing air freight sector.  I am confident that Shannon Airport is doing this today and will continue to do so in the future.</P>

These include a right of connection to the fixed public telephone network and access to fixed public telephone services, provisions relating to the quality and capability of those services, directory services and public pay telephones, measures to cater for vulnerable groups of users such as the elderly, those with disabilities and those with special needs, the adjustment of tariffs to ensure the affordability of services and the publication and access to information relating to services.</P>

      <P>The current UN and EU national accounting methodology specifically exclude from the national accounts the value of unpaid work, including the work done by members of a household for itself.  Any inclusion of unpaid work in the annual accounts would have to include both women's and men's unwaged housework as well as unwaged work done outside the home e.g. voluntary community work.  The measurement of the extent of these activities and their valuations will involve considerable work.  However, provision is made for the possibility of using satellite accounts to extend the core accounting system to provide <Col N="342" /> additional information where the estimation methods are not yet sufficiently developed to allow their inclusion in the main accounts.</P>
      <P>In consideration of this and of the commitments given in Partnership 2000, a pilot time use survey was carried out by the CSO in June 1997. This survey covered some 300 households with nearly 1,000 respondents.  As well as answering a wide range of questions, respondents also completed a time use diary, broken down into ten minute intervals, for two days.</P>
      <P>Processing of this detailed data has taken longer than planned.  The CSO is now analysing the data collected in the survey and is preparing a report on the experience gained in the pilot survey and the implications, particularly in relation to the feasibility and cost of a full-scale time use survey.</P>
      <P>In its Statement of Strategy 1998-2000, the CSO has indicated that it will seek Government approval and the necessary resources to conduct a full-time use survey in year 2000.  The CSO's priority is to extend the range of data available at present to comply with the requirements of the European system of accounts &mdash; ESA95 &mdash; as well as fulfilling the requirements of the European Monetary Union.  Therefore, it does not envisage being able to undertake the necessary research to incorporate the value of unpaid work in the national accounts for the foreseeable future. However, the CSO is continuing to monitor international methodological developments in this area.  There is no research group in the CSO dealing with this issue and I am not aware of any other research group in this area.</P>

      <P>The jobs initiative JI and the back to work allowance BTWA scheme have different functions.  The JI is an active labour market programme for persons over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for five years or more.  The back to work allowance is an in-work subsidy open to persons unemployed for one year or more, who take up a job either as employees or as self-employed.</P>
      <P>The schemes are not in competition.  A BTWA job is, in principle, permanent whereas a placement on JI is temporary, three years duration.  In terms of access to progression options a person on JI has undiminished rights as a long-term unemployed person.  This is not the case for persons on BTWA, e.g. it would be possible for a person to progress from JI to BTWA but not <i>vice versa.</i>  Because the schemes have different functions and are targeted at different cohorts the incentives to participate are pitched differently, with persons on BTWA being able to retain secondary benefits while persons on JI just retain their medical cards although they are also eligible for family income supplement.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that JI is a pilot programme nearing the second year of completion for the first 1,000 participants.  I intend to have the programme independently reviewed in the near future and I would like to see the issue of secondary benefits, addressed <i>inter alia</i> in that review.</P>

      <P>There is an extensive block of health and safety legislation in Ireland which adequately meets the requirements necessary to protect our workforce and which conforms to best international practices. Measures such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the 1993 general application regulations and the 1995 construction regulations provide a solid legislative framework by which effective and co-ordinated management of all construction projects can be ensured, and by which health and safety standards can be set. This legislation specifies that it is the primary duty of every individual employer to identify and manage the health and safety needs of his or her own business, and also lays down the duties of clients, designers and workers.</P>
      <P>The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is responsible for the enforcement of all occupational health and safety legislation. The authority works to a targeted annual work programme and focuses on sectors with high accident rates and, in particular, the construction sector.  The Safety, Health and Walfare at Work Act, 1989, applies to all sectors of employment and the authority approaches its considerable tasks on the basis of a successful combination of information, inspection and enforcement.  The authority has always adopted a pro-active approach to its work and, given the ever evolving nature of work to-day, has proven itself more than capable of responding appropriately in different ways to different situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, in response to concerns about construction site safety, the authority launched its construction action programme during the summer. This action programme is a wide-ranging exercise which seeks to involve all the players, from client to workers, and to highlight their respective roles in improving site safety.  The series of measures announced by the authority, if acted on by all the players in the industry, should help to bring accident rates in construction down to levels in other industries.  These measures include the following; clients must be familiar with their legal responsibilities including the need to appoint competent personnel and must be generally <Col N="345" /> aware of work under way, including any major problems arising on safety.  To this end the authority will notify major clients who are currently having construction works carried out of the fact of prohibition notices and prosecution proceedings in respect of those works.  Public sector clients have a major role to play given the size of the public capital programme.  I have written to all my Government colleagues asking them to ensure that no public sector contract is awarded to a firm or contractor who does not have a safety statement as they are obliged to do so under the 1989 Act.  Also, the authority is working with the Government contracts committee to see what other measures can be put in place, while still operating within the regulatory framework of public procurement.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to involve designers in the improvement of safety standards in new developments, through training and awareness raising exercises.</P>
    <P>The training of workers is another key area of concern.  In this regard, FÁS will bring together its various training programmes under its new construction skills certification scheme, but of course all personnel on site, whether site managers, employees, sub-contractors or the self-employed need to receive appropriate training in health and safety on a systematic basis.  The authority will be discussing with representatives of the industry ways of ensuring that training initiatives such as this have the maximum take-up.</P>
    <P>The role of workers themselves has always been crucial at the place of work &mdash; workers too have duties and responsibilities to look after their own safety and that of their colleagues.  Safety consultation, including safety committee meetings and tool box talks, will be encouraged among construction workers.</P>
    <P>The authority has set up a construction inspection team who will cover this sector exclusively, and will do so with vigour and enthusiasm.  By making this expertise available to the industry a marked improvement in standards is expected. Contractors with poor safety records will be asked to work with the authority in a structured programme to improve their safety management systems.</P>
    <P>In addition, the authority will continue to make every effort to disseminate good quality information on best practice.  For example, the authority is currently working with the industry to produce a new code of practice on scaffolding.</P>
    <P>The authority's response is a comprehensive one &mdash; the authority has never operated in a &ldquo;stalemate&rdquo; manner in relation to its obligations, and this construction action programme is another welcome example of its pro-active approach to its statutory functions and obligations.</P>
    <P>The programme is, of course, underpinned by the punitive sanctions to which the authority has recourse under health and safety legislation. While the authority has always emphasised the value of working in partnership with industry, <Col N="346" /> and will continue to do so, nonetheless, it will not hesitate to use those sanctions where necessary.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have also recently announced sanction for the recruitment of a further 13 staff to the Health and Safety Authority.  This is in addition to the seven posts which were authorised from the start of this year as an immediate measure to relieve the pressure under which the authority was then operating. This most recent sanction will bring the total staff complement in the authority to 132 and will put it in a better position to meet the ever increasing demands being placed upon it from all sectors of employment, including the construction sector.  I would like to emphasise that this particular package represents part of an ongoing process designed to take account of the development needs of the authority over the next two to three years as it consolidates its present role and takes on new responsibilities.</P>
    <P>However, what needs to be fully acknowledged is that while additional resources are essential to the authority, no amount of health and safety inspectors by themselves will eliminate workplace accidents if employers and workers alike do not take more responsibility for their own safety.  To this end, I have had a number of meetings with both SIPTU and CIF to discuss the main issues of common concern within the construction sector and with a view to facilitating and strengthening the essential partnership approach to tackling these issues.  A spirit of true partnership, to match the Government's commitment of increased resources, can bring about very real and substantial change.</P>

      <P>The telecommunications sector worldwide is undergoing a process of reform driven on the one hand by rapid technological developments and on the other by the implementation of liberalisation of telecommunications markets which were traditionally characterised by monopoly supply.  In response to these developments there has been a huge increase in merger, alliance and take-over activity as market players seek to exploit new opportunities both in newly opened markets and in the provision of new advanced services and to defend market positions against new and emerging challenges.  The Irish market has been no exception and the joint initiative by the ESB and British Telecom is a further example of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> The rapid advances in technology and in particular the advent of the Internet pave the way for the introduction of a whole new range of services including the potential delivery of movies to the home on-line.  In practice, existing telecommunications infrastructures will have to be upgraded substantially before laboratory proven capabilities of this kind can be deployed on a mass market basis.  The question of the timing and extent of such deployment are uncertain variables at this point in time.  The prospective challenge to the viability of the traditional role of the video rental business is therefore equally uncertain.</P>
    <P>It is however important to point out that the technological changes which are driving convergence between the traditionally separate telecommunications, broadcasting, information technology, publishing and entertainment sectors bring not only risks but also opportunities.  For example, many operators in the video rental sector have already diversified into areas such as rental of computer games and provision of mobile telephony equipment.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, it is a matter for individual enterprises to respond to technological developments and resultant competitive challenges and to exploit any opportunities which emerge in their marketplace.</P>

      <P>Open competition in Ireland in the markets referred to may be ensured by compliance with the principles enshrined in the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, which are enforced by the independent Competition Authority.  Where there exists a complaint or suspicion that a contravention of these principles has or may occur the Director of Competition Enforcement is empowered to investigate the matter and to make recommendations and give advice to the Competition Authority in this regard.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Act set out the rules of competition and section 4 of that Act prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State.  Section 5 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position.  Section 6 of the 1991 Act provides for right of action for firms or individuals in the courts by way of injunction, declaration, or damages including exemplary damages in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> The 1996 Amendment Act specifies offences and penalties for breaches of the rules of competition. In addition it provides for the public enforcement of the rules of competition.  A Director of Competition Enforcement and his staff have been appointed to give effect to the public enforcement provisions of the 1996 Act.  Competition rules in the European Economic Area and more particularly in the EU are a matter for decision and enforcement by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>In so far as the method by which open competition comes onto the market for the delivery of telephony, e-mail and Internet access services this is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Enterprise.  A key element in the transition from a monopoly to a fully competitive market is the establishment, in the interim, of sector specific regulation.  The Minister for Public Enterprise promulgated the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, which provided for the setting up of the office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation and it is the director who decides who the players are in the market referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Among the functions of the director are: the licensing of telecommunications operators and telecommunication service providers, regulation of access agreements including arbitration where necessary, the managing and licensing of the radio frequency spectrum and the television retransmission sector, the regulation of Telecom Éireann charges for services which are not subject to full competition.  In addition to compliance with the terms of licences issued by the regulator, compliance with the Competition Acts is also necessary in offering services in the marketplace. We are already seeing the benefits of increasing competition in the telecommunications market. All areas of telecommunications have now been liberalised with the exception of Telecom Éireann's monoply on voice telephony.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Government decided to end Telecom's derogation on voice telephony on 1 December &mdash; 13 months ahead of schedule. Telecom Éireann has recently announced the latest in a series of price cuts in the run up to the opening up of the market.  Further benefits to the consumer will follow.  The Government has decided to sell Cablelink, which is currently owned by Telecom Éireann &mdash; 75 per cent and RTE &mdash; 25 per cent.  Cablelink has the potential to become a strong competitor in the developing Irish communications market, in time offering services such as voice telephony, high speed Internet access, home shopping, tele-banking and video conferencing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 158 together.</P>
      <P>At my request, the High Court ordered on 30 March 1998 under section 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, that Mr. Tom Grace, FCA, and the retired Supreme court judge, Mr. John Blayney, SC, be appointed as inspectors to investigate and report on the affairs of National Irish Bank Ltd. relating <i>inter alia</i> to the improper charging of interest and the improper charging of fees to customer accounts.  The inspectors' remit includes the identification of the person or persons responsible for or aware of these alleged practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10 June last, the inspectors to National Irish Bank presented an interim report to the High Court at a sitting held in camera.  On the following day, the High Court decided that a trial should take place of a number of issues on which the inspectors had sought directions from the court.  Following the required hearings, the High Court on 13 July determined <i>inter alia</i> that the procedures proposed to be employed by the <Col N="350" /> inspectors were consistent with the requirements of natural and constitutional justice and that persons were not entitled to refuse to answer the inspectors' questions on the grounds of possible self-incrimination.  An appeal of this decision is currently being made to the Supreme Court by certain National Irish Bank employees.</P>
    <P>Separately last March, my colleague, the Minister for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, exercised certain of his powers under the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, and requested the Director of Consumer Affairs to carry out an investigation into the practices and procedures employed by credit institutions in regard to the imposition of charges, in order to ensure that the interests of consumers were adequately protected.</P>
    <P>The director wrote to all credit institutions, including National Irish Bank, seeking a written assurance that the institutions impose only those charges which had been notified to him under section 149 of the Act.  The director received a written assurance to that effect from National Irish Bank.  The director also issued a statement on 27 March 1998 requesting <i>inter alia</i> that the full current value be restored to any of the bank's customers who were found to have been the subject of improper charging.</P>
    <P>It is understood that the bank has since reimbursed certain of its customers as a result of its own internal investigations.  As the remit of the inspectors is a general one into the bank's affairs, I expect that it will be clear from their findings the extent to which these reimbursements represent full value for the losses of customers.  I will be seeking legal advice on what appropriate action should be taken on completion of the inspectors' report in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take written Questions Nos. 160 and 164 together.</P>
      <P>The objective of community employment &mdash; CE &mdash; is to provide temporary opportunities for those who are having difficulty in obtaining employment so that they can develop skills and obtain part-time work experience which will enhance their prospects of obtaining a job in the open labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is part financed from savings in social welfare payments in order to maximise <Col N="353" /> the availability of places.  Its eligibility criteria are designed specifically to discriminate positively in favour of those who experience greatest difficulty in obtaining employment in order to prevent them from becoming marginalised.</P>
    <P>CE is primarily targeted at those over 21 years and whose principal or only source of income is an unemployment compensation payment or one parent family payment &mdash; OPFP &mdash; for at least 12 months.  However, other disadvantaged categories such as travellers, those referred by the NRB and programme refugees, who have difficulty in entering the labour market regardless of age, can also participate.  In addition married persons can swap their social welfare entitlement with a spouse in order for that person to qualify for CE. Those in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and who have children can apply to revert to one parent family payment and, if awarded this, qualify to participate in CE.  Women on deserted wife's benefit who wish to re-enter the labour market can, of course, access a wide array of FÁS training courses and return to work courses.</P>
    <P>Settled persons between 18 and 21 years are not an eligible category for CE as it is easier for this group than their traveller peers to obtain employment.  Where settled young persons need support to progress to job readiness a placement in training, education or in a jobsclub is much more appropriate than community employment. As a group travellers are particularly marginalised in terms of access to the jobs market and this is recognised in the eligibility criteria for community employment.</P>
    <P>Any change to the CE eligibility criteria will be examined in the context of considering the recommendations made by the consultants who have undertaken a comprehensive review of the programme on behalf of the Government.  This review is being published to facilitate the maximum consultation with the various stakeholders involved.</P>

      <P>Following initial consideration by the Government of an Eircell <Col N="354" /> proposal to use Garda masts for mobile telephone services I requested the Competition Authority in July 1998 pursuant to section 11 of the Competition Acts, 1991 and 1996, to carry out a study and an analysis of the competition aspects of the matter and to report to me.  I have now received that report from the Competition Authority and it has been considered by the Government and will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>While the views set out in the report on the practice and method of competition involved represent those of the independent Competition Authority, I broadly share those views on competition. I intend to place copies of the report in the Library of the House and to publish it as soon as the Government has concluded its consideration of the matter.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the matters raised there relate to planning, regulatory and environmental issues which are the responsibility of other Ministers and the Deputy may wish to raise those individual matters with appropriate Ministers.</P>

      <P>Statutory instruments S.I. 525 of 1997 and S.I. 526 of 1997 require that electrical appliances, supplied or offered for supply, in the State: (a) shall have a 13 amp plug attached; (b) that such plug shall comply with the requirements of Irish Standard IS 401: 1977 Specification for 13A rewirable and non-rewireable plugs, or equivalent standard; and (c) that compliance shall be approved by a designated body, notified under Article 11 of the Low Voltage Directive (73/23/EEC).</P>
      <P>The British standard BS 1363 is an equivalent standard to IS 401 and, therefore, if a plug fitted to a UK appliance is approved by a designated body, to BS 1363, it complies with IS 401.</P>

      <P>Under the Insurance Act, 1989, certain responsibilities are imposed upon insurance companies in respect of their dealings with insurance intermediaries. As previously announced the Government is currently drafting legislation which will transfer regulatory responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank.  In drafting this legislation, it is not our intention to change in any material way the responsibilities imposed upon insurance companies in respect of insurance intermediaries.</P>
      <P>Insurance companies, through their umbrella organisation, the Irish Insurance Federation, have established the Insurance Intermediary Compliance Bureau IICB to carry out certain checks to meet, in part, the insurers' responsibilities under the Insurance Act, 1989.  The role and functions of the IICB are entirely a matter for the insurance companies which appointed the body.</P>
      <P>We are completely satisfied, that any shortcomings that may exist in the regulatory regime for insurance intermediaries will be eliminated, once responsibility has transferred to the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Contracts for Time Sharing of Immovable Property &mdash; Protection of Purchasers) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 204 of 1997) came into operation in Ireland on 19 May 1997.  These regulations gave effect to European Parliament and Council Directive 94/47/EC on the protection of purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a timeshare basis.  The protections include a requirement to supply those seeking information on timeshare properties with a brochure giving specific details of the property, including location, current status, associated services and facilities, details on the vendor, the price and the right to cancellation.  There is also provision for a cooling-off period and a prohibition on vendors seeking deposits.  The regulations are enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs, who has wide-ranging <Col N="356" /> powers to regulate timeshare-selling activities.  In addition, Directive 98/27/EC on Injunctions for the Protection of Consumers' Interests allowing recognised consumer organisations in one member state to take action in the courts of another member state in order to protect the collective interest of consumers where practices contrary to certain directives, including the timeshare directive, listed in the annex to Directive 98/27/EC occur, is due for implementation by end December 2000.</P>
      <P>I would urge Irish consumers to exercise caution before entering into any timeshare contract. In particular, consumers should satisfy themselves that the contract would fall within the protections of the Irish regulations.  I understand that the Director of Consumer Affairs and the European Consumer Information Centre, ECIC, in Dublin have received complaints about timeshare contracts but these do not appear to fit the type of concerns to which the Deputy adverts.  I would invite the Deputy to provide whatever information he has to the office of the director for investigation as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Apropos the references to another member state, the Deputy will be aware that responsibility for ensuring that EU legislation is properly implemented throughout the EU is a matter for the Commission.</P>

    <P>There are a number of projects, however, which have been approved for European Social Fund aid which have not yet received an advance of funds from the European Commission.  In order to try and overcome the difficulties which are being encountered in drawing down funds under this programme, my Department has scheduled a meeting with the UK and Welsh authorities for later this week.  In addition, there is ongoing contact with the Commission to find ways around the technical problems that have <Col N="357" /> arisen which have resulted in delays in the receipt of European Social Fund moneys into my Department.  I would like to assure the Deputy that no effort is being spared in trying to find a resolution to the problem.</P>

It also prohibits practices such as below cost selling, boycotting, hello money, and provides for control of terms and conditions of supply.  The order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Groceries Order, among other matters, is currently being reviewed by the competition and mergers review group which was set up after the passing of the Competition (Amendment) Act, 1996.

      <P>Ireland fully supports international efforts, especially through the International Labour Organisation &mdash; ILO &mdash; to eliminate forced and child labour practices and to encourage compliance with these and other core labour standards. At this year's ILO annual conference a declaration on core labour standards was adopted which specifically targets the elimination of all <Col N="359" /> forms of forced or compulsory labour and the effective abolition of child labour.</P>
      <P>At the conference, the ILO also initiated discussions on a draft convention and draft recommendation focusing on the most intolerable forms of child labour.  This convention and draft recommendation will come up for final dicussion at the annual conference next year.  Ireland will be represented at this conference by a tripartite delegation comprised of Government, employer and trade union delegates.</P>
      <P>Ireland also fully supports efforts at EU level to ensure compliance with core labour standards through the European Union's generalised system of preferences scheme which provides preferential access to Community markets for developing countries.  Special incentive arrangements have been put in place to encourage beneficiary countries to comply with the ILO standards. In the discussions which will commence shortly on a revised GSP scheme we will look favourably on any proposal from the Commission which strengthens the impact of these incentives or increases them.</P>
      <P>At present there is no EU legislation in force requiring codes of good conduct nor is it expected that any proposal will be made to introduce such a requirement in the future.  I believe that the way forward towards stamping out forced and child labour practices is through multilateral action rather than through imposing regulatory burdens in relation to imports from outside the EU and we will continue to pursue such an approval at international level, in particular through the ILO.</P>

      <P>I am providing to the Deputy a table of reported rod catches for the period 1985-97 for the main seatrout fisheries.  While statistics for 1998 are not fully collated, preliminary indications are that the overall figures will be up on 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>National seatrout conservation, management and research programmes since 1991 have been directed towards stock assessment, rehabilitation and conservation measures as well as work to address the various adverse factors affecting seatrout stocks and habitats, including drainage, pollution, predation, erosion and acidification.  The measures include intensive sealice management strategies on marine salmon farms.  Further enhancement of these multiple strategies, including sealice management, was put in place following the Whitaker task force report of 1994 which has been the agreed blueprint for seatrout programmes since that time.  There is evidence that the strategies are paying dividends with improvements in a number of stocks.  The reliability of rod catch statistics and stock assessment is being <Col N="361" /> improved in order to better quantify the impact of conservation, management and rehabilitation strategies.  Funding has been provided under the tourism angling measure for the Marine Institute's fish counter programme and for seatrout enhancement work by the Salmon Research Agency.  Sealice management and monitoring programmes are rigorously overseen and are the most comprehensive and intensive such programmes in Europe.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>Sealice management and monitoring strategies on marine salmon farms have been in place since 1991 and were comprehensively enhanced in 1994 in line with the recommenadations of the Whitaker Sea Trout Force Report which is the agreed blueprint for seatrout programmes.  All marine finfish farms operate lice management regimes which are monitored on a monthly basis.  Farms are monitored twice per month during the critical period for the wild seatrout smolt run i.e. March to May.  The monthly reports of lice levels on farms are circulated at the end of each monthly sampling period to the Central Fisheries Board, the regional fisheries boards, private fishery owners (on request) and other interested parties. On any occasion where elevated lice levels are recorded or where the potential for development of elevated levels is detected, fish farmers are obliged to take all necessary remedial action.</P>
      <P>Comprehensive fishhusbandry and fishhealth strategies including fallowing of production sites, separation of year classes and production techniques are also recognised as contributing significantly to sealice control.  All finfish farms must be licensed under the Fisheries and Foreshore Acts. An extensive consultation and assessment process takes place before a licence is granted.  Where licences are granted they are subject to compliance with strict conditions in relation to fishhusbandry, production parameters and fishhealth.</P>

    <P>The Irish salmon farming industry is one of the most highly regulated aquaculture industries by international standards.  The enhanced regulatory framework for the acquaculture industry introduced in the Fisheries Amendment Act, 1997, <Col N="362" /> underlines the sustainable development imperative which will underpin contnued growth and jobs in the sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>A report from the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board on the salmon run to the River Moy this year indicates that in common with a number of other rivers, the run of spring salmon was disappointing and there was a significant reduction in rod catches of spring salmon.</P>
      <P>Rod catches in June were relatively poor due to the grilse run being one month later than usual. Catches in the main grilse run up to end July were good.  The total recorded rod catch for the river for the season is about 6,000 fish, which is a decrease of 20 per cent on the annual catch over the past five years.  Persistent high water levels during the summer months will have contributed to the reduced rod catch.</P>
      <P>The installation of a fish counter on the Moy, funded under the tourism angling measure, will provide enhanced information on stocks and will facilitate improved monitoring and management of salmon/grilse stocks in the river.  The operation of the traps on the Moy Fishery by the Central Fisheries Board is kept under regular review by the Board in light of ongoing stock assessment scientific advice and all other relevant factors. The CFB has already reduced the length of season and number of days per week for operation of the traps.  Utilisation was postponed until June this year.  I have asked the Central Fisheries Board to review with the North West Regional Fisheries Board future operational strategies for the Moy Fishery including the operation of the traps in the context of progressing the overall arrangements for transfer of the management of the fishery to the North West Regional Board.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to impose a moratorium on netting for salmon at sea and in estuaries.  My immediate policy priority is to continue to progress my conservation and management strategies for the salmon resource on a consensus basis and which requires recognition of the need to give and take on the part of anglers and commercial netsmen alike.</P>
      <P>The impact of the conservation measures which I renewed for 1998 has been to effectively reduce the commercial salmon season to the months of June and July.  I will be assessing the conservation measures needed for 1999 in light of trends this year, with particular reference to concerns about the state of spring salmon stocks.  The evidence available indicates clearly the continued need for reduced exploitation on the part of all involved in spring salmon fishing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems arising from the use of different types of fishing gear on fishing grounds are best resolved at local level, through co-operation between fishermen.  The code of practice drawn <Col N="364" /> up some years ago for inshore fishermen and trawlermen, was designed to minimise the risk to local fishing gear from trawling activities.  The code of practice has facilitated a degree of co-operation between fishermen and has contributed to a reduction in the level of lost or damaged gear.  My Department, in association with Bord Iascaigh Mhara, is setting up meetings of inshore fishing and trawling groups to review recent incidents and the operation and effectiveness of the code of practice.</P>
    <P>A compensation procedure of an informal nature has operated within the framework of the code of practice in cases of verifiable gear loss or damage.  While the person referred to by the Deputy made a claim for compensation in respect of lobster pots, it has not been possible, in the absence of any verifiable identification of the vessels involved, to resolve the claim to date.  The compensation system will be on the agenda at the forthcoming meetings with all relevant interests.</P>

This action primarily relates to one aspect of Ireland's transposition of the directive, i.e. the levels at which EIA should be required for certain classes of projects, one of which is afforestation.  Full effect has been given to the directive in Ireland since the introduction of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989, and other relevant regulations.  Ireland has lodged a full defence and a public hearing of the case took place in Luxembourg recently.  The advocate general of the court is expected to deliver an opinion on the case on 2 December 1998.  The judgment will be given some time therafter.  My Department has no information on other similar actions being taken by the European Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>In December 1995 four prospecting licences were granted to BHP Minerals International Exploration Inc., under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1995, to undertake a programme of mineral exploration in the Carlingford peninsula in County Louth.  The licences are valid for a period of six years.  The purpose of the company's exploration programme is to ascertain the character, extent or value of minerals which may be lying on or under the land in the licence areas.  The licences were granted in respect of the following minerals: base metals; silver; gold; vanadium; chromium; cobalt; nickel; ruthenium; rhodium; palladium; osmium; iridium; platinum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must stress that what have been granted to BHP are prospecting licences.  No permission has been granted for mining.  All aspects of prospecting <Col N="366" /> are subject to safeguards and controls to protect the State's rights, landowners' rights and licence holders' rights, while having regard to protection of the environment.  The most conspicuous part of prospecting involves drilling which is no more harmful to the environment than sinking a well.  I insist that drillholes are sealed, where appropriate, when drilling is completed to ensure that no easy route is made for pollutants to subsequently percolate down through the ground and that animals will not injure themselves.</P>
    <P>By its very nature most prospecting comes to nought.  If an economic prospect is found, however, before mining would be considered a company would have to:</P>
    <P>(a) apply for planning permission from the local authority;</P>
    <P>(b) apply for an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency;</P>
    <P>(c) apply to me for a State Mining Facility (SMF).</P>
    <P>All three processes require the preparation and publishing for public examination and comment of an environmental impact statement.  All three applications would also be subject to public advertisement which allows objections to be made and taken into account.  In no circumstances will I award an SMF unless both planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence are in place and where I do grant an SMF it is a strict condition that it is made void by noncompliance with both.  This ensures that when I grant an SMF I have been satisfied that the project is environmentally acceptable.</P>

      <P>I am aware of a number of reports and studies on the use of ragworms &mdash; nareis &mdash; as biological indicators for the marine environment. These species are, however, of little use in the testing of toxicity in the water column as they are predominantly sediment dwelling.  I understand that their use in marine environment monitoring programmes for testing sediment quality is also limited because of their insensitivity to contaminants and that studies have been shown to give unreliable data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national marine monitoring programme is carried out in accordance with the Oslo and Paris Commissions' &mdash; OSPAR &mdash; Joint Assessment <Col N="367" /> and Monitoring Programme &mdash; JAMP.  This is an agreed programme for the monitoring and assessment of the marine environment of the north-eastern Atlantic and specific guidelines apply so as to ensure the quality and complementary aspect of the data obtained.  At present the main emphasis is on chemical monitoring of contaminants in water and sediments, and on biota-using techniques which have been shown to provide results capable of providing a convention-wide assessment e.g. the Quality Status Report 2000 in which Ireland is currently involved.</P>
    <P>There is, however, an increasing acceptance that biological effects monitoring should form a substantial part of JAMP and that a co-ordinated chemical and biological effects monitoring programme is essential for identifying areas of concern. I am keeping developments in this area under review.</P>

Accordingly, it is a matter for the local authority, in the first instance, to determine that works may be required at the harbour.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I announced recently that grant assistance of £64,500 is being made available to the county council towards a silt dredging scheme at Ballycotton.  It is a condition of this grant aid that the works be completed before the end of 1998.  My Department has not, to date, received any proposals from the county council concerning the breakwater at Ballycotton.  While I would, of course, give careful consideration to any such proposals, if submitted, I must point out that they would have to be considered in the context of the overall development requirements and available funding for fishery harbours generally.</P>

      <P>In 1997 allocations for Overseas Development Assistance &mdash; ODA &mdash; amounted to £124.47 million. This amounted to 0.30 per cent of a GNP figure of £41,919 million.  In the document An Action Programme for the Millennium, a key priority was stated to be the adoption of an interim overseas development assistance target of at least 0.45 per cent of GNP by 2002 on the way to reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with that commitment, £137 million was allocated for ODA in the 1998 budget.  In addition this month the Government indicated its intention, subject to Dáil approval, of providing a further sum of £22 million, £14 million in 1998 and the balance in subsequent years, for a debt <Col N="371" /> relief package for developing countries.  It is estimated that this will bring official ODA to 0.325 per cent of the provisional 1998 GNP figure which is itself growing at a rate of 7.5 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The Government's aim is to continue to increase the ODA allocation and to ensure that we have an aid programme which is effective, focused and sustainable and which is targeted at alleviating the poverty of people in some of the least developed countries in the world.  It is also our intention to work with the international community to create conditions in the global economy which will allow developing countries to reach their full potential to the benefit of their people.  This includes an effort to halt the current downward trend in flows of assistance from the developed world and to achieve agreement among donor countries on the necessity of reaching the UN target of 0.7 per cent of ODA as one of the most important instruments in development.</P>

      <P>The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; BIIC &mdash; will be established on the entry into force of the British-Irish Agreement early next year.  It will replace and subsume both the conference set up under the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council set up after the 1980 summit.  The BIIC will essentially operate like the present conference, under the co-chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but with a number of key differences.  It will cover all Irish-British Governmental matters, not just Northern Ireland.  It is recognised, however, that it will deal largely with Northern Ireland and will meet usually in a dedicated Northern Ireland format.  The conference will not be involved in matters which have been devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Relevant members of the Northern Ireland Executive will be involved in the meetings of the conference. The BIIC will be supported by a standing joint secretariat of Irish and British officials.</P>

      <Col N="372" /> A British Irish Council &mdash; BIC &mdash; will also be established under the British-Irish Agreement to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the peoples of these islands.  It will comprise representatives of the British and Irish Governments, devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and, if appropriate, any others established in the United Kingdom, together with representatives of the Isle of Man and the Channel Isles.  It will meet twice a year at summit level, and in sectoral formats at ministerial level on a regular basis.  It will exchange information, discuss, consult and use its best endeavours to reach agreement on co-operation on matters of mutual interest within the competence of the relevant administrations.  It will operate by consensus and not all members need be involved in any given area of co-operation. The BIC will have a secretariat provided by the Irish and British Governments in co-ordination with officials of each of the other members.

      <P>The situation in Kosovo is a cause for grave concern. <Col N="373" /> I believe we are witnessing there the prospect of a humanitarian catastrophe which could replicate the horrors of Bosnia.  The latest UN estimates of refugees and displaced persons now total more than 291,000 and appproximately 50,000 of these are without shelter and other basic needs as the harsh Balkan winter rapidly approaches.

The resoluton provides a good basis for reaching a solution, setting out in detail the steps to be taken to bring this conflict to an end and to provide relief for the suffering civilian population.  It is important that all parties to the conflict adhere to its demand that hostilities cease immediately so that a meaningful dialogue can start without delay and the risks of a humanitarian catastrophe can be reduced.</P>
      <P>Intensive efforts are now being made by the international community to ensure the start of the dialogue between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Kosovo Albanian leadership.  Austria, as EU Presidency, is co-ordinating the efforts of EU partners.  I am maintaining close contact with the Presidency in order to provide whatever advice and assistance I can.  Resolution 1199 further calls on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to enable effective and continuous international monitoring in Kosovo by, <i>inter alia</i>, the European Community Monitoring Mission &mdash; ECMM &mdash; to which Ireland contributes.</P>
      <P>While the early start of dialogue is essential, the provision of humanitarian aid and the implementation of measures to allow the safe return of refugees and displaced persons are equally pressing priorities.  Resolution 1199 spells out clearly to the Yugoslav authorities what they are now required to do so that these objectives can be achieved.</P>
      <P>The Government has already provided £50,000 to the International Federation of the Red Cross for Kosovan refugees in Albania and is actively considering additional assistance.  The European Community Humanitarian Office &mdash; ECHO &mdash; has announced an aid package amounting to ECU 8.55 million in response to the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wide-scale abuse of human rights in Kosovo, including reports of summary executions, kidnappings and mistreatment of civilians, is also cause for serious concern.  Resolution 1199 addresses this aspect comprehensively, and prescribes what has to be done by the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, whose work has to be facilitated by the Yugoslav authorities, as well as the latter assuming their <Col N="374" /> responsibilities to bring to justice their agents guilty of such crimes.</P>
    <P>The solution to the conflict in Kosovo has to be brought about by negotiation and political means.  No approaches have been made to the Government regarding recognition of an independent state of Kosovo.  While the international community has not indicated any support for the independence of Kosovo, there is widespread support not only for the restoration of Kosovo's autonomous status, but also for the enhancement of this status.  This is the view of the Government, and it is a view shared by our partners in the European Union.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>Both before and since the massacre at Acteal, I have followed with concern the situation in Chiapas, Mexico, particularly the reports of the serious violations of the human rights of the indigenous people.  The tragic situation in Chiapas is characterised by grave ethnic, religious and political conflicts, sharp disparities of income and disputes between large landowners and indigenous communities.  The Mexican Government is attempting to bring to an end a four year old rebellion by the Zapatista Liberation Front and other indigenous groups.  Tensions have been exacerbated by the scale of the presence of federal forces which the Government regard as necessary to maintain the peace.  Others, including representatives of the indigenous people and a number of NGOs, have said that these forces are responsible for abuses and have been involved in arming and training paramilitary groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The federal Government's response to the crisis included the establishment of a mediation <Col N="375" /> commission &mdash; CONAI &mdash; to facilitate negotiations with the rebels who refuse to engage in direct talks.  However, Bishop Samuel Ruiz's resignation earlier this year as President of CONAI and his criticisms of the Mexican Government clearly reflect the difficulties encountered in the mediation process.</P>
    <P>The Mexican authorities have been made aware of Ireland's close interest in this issue. With our EU partners, we have been active in encouraging the Mexican Government to ensure the safety of the civilian population in Chiapas. Following the Acteal massacre, the European Union condemned the killings and called on the Mexican Government to make a full investigation. The EU has made known its expectation that the Mexican Government will protect the civilian population and undertake action to end impunity before the law of perpetrators of serious human rights violations.  The new EU-Mexico Global Agreement will be conditional on respect for human rights.  Both the EU and Mexico are committed to this conditionality.</P>
    <P>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Robinson, has recently expressed concern about reports of the indigenous people of Chiapas being caught between government forces and armed resistance groups.  She appealed to the government to look urgently at ways of restoring dialogue.  She added that a reduction in the military presence in the region could be an important first step in restoring confidence that a peaceful solution might be found.</P>
    <P>Mexico has informed the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights of Government strategy to resolve the question of Chiapas with the help of dialogue and by tackling the structural causes of marginalisation and extreme poverty connected with the underdevelopment of the region.  It is understood that measures are now being taken with a view to the reform of the security forces and to end abuses and impunity for human rights violations.  In his State of the Union address on 1 September, President Zedillo acknowledged &ldquo;many years of accumulated deficiencies, injustice and neglect&rdquo; and said that public safety and justice constitute an essential obligation of the State.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the cases of the two people named, one of whom was an Irish citizen.  The Irish Embassy in Buenos Aires at the time played a central role in ensuring that the Irish citizen was <Col N="376" /> released, locating the place of his detention, visiting it quickly and maintaining strong pressure on the authorities.  Our primary involvement was, of course, with the Irish citizen, but the two cases were closely related.  Both were detained during the military dictatorship in Argentina.  The Irish citizen had been tortured and we understand that the other individual suffered similar treatment. Both individuals were eventually released and are now living in Argentina.</P>
      <P>Very serious atrocities occurred under the Argentine military dictatorship.  Under the democratic administrations which replaced the dictatorship, legislation was passed, the effect of which was to grant immunity from punishment to those who were responsible for violations of human rights during the military regime.  I understand that there has been ongoing debate in Argentina on the repeal of this legislation. However, it is not certain that any repeal could have retrospective effect.  We understand that both persons referred to in the question have received civil compensation from the Argentine authorities for their ordeal.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 204 and 212 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been most concerned with the on-going situation in Algeria, particularly the continuation of appalling massacres involving innocent civilians including children, since I took office.  As the House will recall, I visited Algeria last December and met President Zeroual and leading <Col N="377" /> government ministers and political figures in this context.  Since then I have met the Algerian Foreign Minister, Mr. Attaf, on two occasions &mdash; once at Palermo in June during a meeting of European Union and Mediterranean Foreign Ministers and the second time at the United Nations last week at New York.  On all occasions I have discussed the current situation in Algeria, including the massacres, and urged the need to end the tragic situation in that country.</P>
    <P>At our meeting last week, Mr. Attaf and I discussed the situation in the light of the decision of Mr. Zeroual to resign as of next February which will necessitate a presidential election.  Mr. Attaf told me that there would be a deepening of the reform process leading to further democratisation, greater pluralism and the revitalisation of the economy.  He also stated that there had been progress in the fight against terrorism.  He spoke of closer ties between the EU and Algeria following the Palermo meeting and said that he would next be discussing the matter with the troika of European Foreign Ministers next month in Vienna.  I renewed the invitation to him to visit Ireland for further talks and he agreed to come subject to the other demands on his schedule.</P>
    <P>In my address to the United Nations General Assembly last week, I highlighted the problems arising from the abuse of human rights and the need for concerted international action to address them.  I will consider further the possibility of co-sponsoring a resolution on Algeria, taking into account, <i>inter alia</i>, the outcome of the session of the Commission on Human Rights last March when it was clear that the international community was not prepared to support such a resolution. The commission has itself not carried out any investigation of the situation there due to the refusal by the Algerian authorities to allow UN investigators to visit that country.  This is also a matter for concern.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity again to assure the House that I will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of the situation in Algeria and to raise the plight of the Algerian people both in international fora and in bilateral contacts with the Algerian Government.</P>

      <P>I am greatly concerned at the continuing abuse of the human rights of the Burmese people by the military regime currently in power in Rangoon and in particular by the recent incidents involving the freedom of movement of the NLD leader and Nobel laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  In my statement to the General Assembly of the United Nations last week, I drew attention to the human <Col N="378" /> rights situation in Burma and urged the need for international action.</P>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to Burma is based on the common position adopted by the European Union in October 1996.  The common position, which is due for renewal next month, expresses the European Union's alarm at the continuing deterioration of the political situation in Burma, including the restrictions imposed on fundamental rights of freedom such as speech, movement and assembly.  It also urges the State Peace and Development Council in Rangoon to restore democracy without delay and respect human rights.</P>
      <P>I have indicated to our EU partners our support for increased pressure on the Burmese Government by strengthening and broadening EU sanctions to include aspects of trade, tourism and investment.  The EU General Affairs Council will be considering further possible measures.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland supported the adoption of a resolution on the situation of human rights in Myanmar in April 1998 at the 54th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  This resolution expressed the concern of the international community at the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar and called upon the Government of Myanmar to guarantee an end to violations of the right to life and the integrity of the human being and to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to avail of every opportunity to work for an improvement of the human rights situation in Burma and to assist the democratic movement in that country.</P>

      <P>The issue of debt represents a serious and growing economic and social problem for many developing countries.  It is now clear that a concerted international effort is required to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>In terms of our national policy, the Minister for Finance and I recently announced details of a major new package of assistance to help address the debt problems of developing countries and to assist the process of economic and social reform in the most heavily indebted poor countries in the world.  This package will comprise a total of £31.5 million, of which £9.5 million has already been committed to two of Irish Aid's priority countries, Mozambique and Tanzania, in debt relief. A total £15 million will be provided for multilateral debt relief under the joint World Bank/IMF heavily indebted poor country &mdash; HIPC &mdash; initiative, while the remaining £7 million will be provided to the enhanced structural adjustment facility &mdash; ESAF &mdash; of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has also agreed that the following principles should underlie Irish policy towards indebtedness in the developing world: debt relief should become an integral part of Ireland's overall overseas development aid strategy, reinforcing the existing emphasis on the fundamental goal of poverty alleviation as well as environmental sustainability and gender equality; Ireland will emphasise the need for definitions of debt sustainability to take human, as well as economic development into account; the Minister for Finance will press for greater transparency in the working of the Bretton Woods Institutions; we will press for increased flexibility in the implementation of the HIPC Initiative in particular <Col N="380" /> with a view to its speedier implementation and its application to as wide a range of the heavily indebted countries as possible; we will continue to encourage the IMF to take full account of the social impact of its policies at the design and implementation phases of its macroeconomic and structural adjustment programmes; we will strongly encourage the international community, including bilateral creditors, to take a generous and flexible approach to the heavily indebted poor countries.  Ireland will continue to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden that is imposing enormous constraints on many developing countries; the Minister for Finance will continue to advocate a greater degree of consultation and involvement for civil society in the developing countries in the planning design and implementation phases of IMF/World Bank programmes; the Minister for Finance will continue to call on the IMF to maximise the use of its own resources to fund a deeper and wider response to the debt problems of third world countries; and emphasis on the importance of continued consultation with the NGO community on issues of concern in relation to debt and development.  These principles, as well as the specific financial contributions involved, will allow Ireland to continue to play a strong and vigorous role in international action to tackle the crisis of developing world indebtedness.</P>
    <P>As regards debt cancellation, Ireland is not a bilateral aid creditor country and supports in this context the call of the G8 countries for bilateral aid-related debt forgiveness.  In respect of general bilateral and multilateral debt, the position taken to date by developing countries is to generally favour reducing the debt burden of the most heavily indebted poor countries to a sustainable level, which would allow them to foster a process of economic growth and development.  Ireland, as stated in the principles announced by the Government, will continue to use every opportunity to press for deeper debt relief so as to ease the debt burden on developing countries.</P>
    <P>The goal of poverty reduction, as the primary focus of Ireland's overseas development programme, is central to Ireland's policy on third world debt.  Poverty eradication has many interrelated dimensions &mdash; national policies to advance sustainable development, fair trade patterns, development of suitable economic and social development programmes involving macroeconomic and fiscal policies, sectoral development, inward investment and debt relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government believes that Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon should take place in accordance with the relevant Resolutions of the UN Security Council.  The Madrid Conference of 1991 inaugurated a series of bilateral negotiations between Israel and its neighbours, including Syria and Lebanon.  Substantive talks took place between Israel and Syria over a period of time following the Madrid Conference. However, following the change of Government in Israel in May 1996 these were suspended. Only preliminary talks between Israel and Lebanon took place at the time of the Madrid Conference.</P>
      <P>The European Union is seriously concerned at this lack of progress.  At Luxembourg last December the European Council reiterated the importance which the EU attached to the relaunching of negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.  The European Council also indicated that it sought the resolution of a comprehensive process on the basis of &ldquo;Land for Peace&rdquo; and demanded the full implementation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.</P>
      <P>On 1 April the Israeli Government stated that it was accepting UN Security Council Resolution 425 so that its forces could leave Lebanon with appropriate security arrangements and so that the Lebanese Government could restore its effective control over southern Lebanon and ensure that its territory would not be used for terrorist attacks against Israel.  This offer was rejected by Lebanon as it was not in conformity with the terms of Resolution 425, which called on Israel immediately to withdraw its forces.</P>
      <P>On 15-16 June the European Council meeting at Cardiff again expressed its grave concern at the lack of progress on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks.  It repeated its earlier call for a continuing effort to reinvigorate the talks.  While the Council welcomed Israeli acceptance of Resolution 425, it called for a full and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.</P>
      <P>On 26 August the European Union issued a declaration expressing its concern about reports that the Israeli Military Committee had approved a plan to expand settlements on the Golan Heights.  The declaration viewed the implementation of such a plan, if it were to take place, as a significant setback to the efforts to resume Israeli-Syrian negotiations and urged the Israeli Government not to proceed with its implementation. The European Union took the opportunity of reiterating its position that settlements in the occupied territories are illegal and in contravention of international law.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Government, both as an EU member state and also as a major contributor to UN peace-keeping activities in the region, have been made clear to the Israeli authorities on a number of occasions.  They have also been raised with the Israeli Ambassador in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Government is firmly of the view that the terms of the Declaration of Principles, also known as the Oslo Accord, signed in Washington on 13 September 1993 and all subsequent related agreements should be fully adhered to by all the parties concerned within the timetables envisaged. The Declaration of Principles and the subsequent agreements addressed a wide range of issues.  Under their terms continuing negotiations between both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority were envisaged over a period of five years after which a permanent status agreement negotiated during the period was to come into effect.  Two of the more sensitive issues covered by the declaration were the gradual redeployment of Israeli troops from the West Bank and Gaza and the definition of the terms of co-operation on a wide range of economic issues of concern to both sides.  The latter included co-operation in the field of transport which envisaged the establishment of a harbour and airport in Gaza and communications links between the West Bank and Gaza.</P>
      <P>Several working groups addressing economic issues were set up and initially made progress. However negotiations regarding Israeli troop redeployment proved difficult from the outset. Since the partial agreed withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron in January 1997, talks on a subsequent redeployment have so far proved impossible to conclude.  A key issue is the amount of land which would be the subject of this exercise. For the past number of months the US has attempted to broker an agreement.  To date, these attempts have been without success.  This failure to reach agreement on redeployment has had an indirect negative impact on the negotiations of agreements on a number of issues in the economic area including the proposed Gaza harbour and airport and the development of an industrial estate.  It is not expected that agreement will be concluded on these issues until the redeployment issue has been settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is most concerned at the lack of progress in this area.  Together with our EU <Col N="383" /> partners we have encouraged both sides to reach agreement urgently.  We have fully supported calls to this effect made at the Luxembourg European Council in December and at the Cardiff European Council in June.  Ireland has also been strongly in favour of the direct involvement by the current EU Presidency in the process.  We have also encouraged the efforts of the European Union's special envoy to the region, Ambassador Moratinos, who has special responsibilities in the field of economic co-operation.  In our bilateral contacts with the parties we have used every available opportunity to press both sides to reach agreement as soon as possible, and will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I am aware of problems facing the Eastern Rite Catholic Church in Romania also known as the Romanian Uniate Church.  Since Ireland does not have resident diplomatic representation in Romania, the Department of Foreign Affairs sought information on this issue from a number of sources including the Holy See, the Commission of the European Union, which has a mission in Bucharest, and the chair of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Although there do not appear to be reports of systematic discrimination against members of the Romanian Uniate Church, there are specific problems such as the issue of the restitution of Church property and places of worship.</P>
      <P>The Council of Europe has raised this issue in a number of reports concerning Romania's obligations and commitments.  In a report, adopted by the parliamentary assembly last year, on the situation concerning the restitution of Church property and places of worship in Romania, it noted that this issue had been partly resolved, but that it was complex and difficult to settle.  There continued to be a financial problem, as the Romanian state struggled to allocate the considerable budgetary resources required for the restitution of property.  The report also noted that there seemed to be an apparent willingness on the part of the authorities in Romania to amend the law on the restitution of places of worship.  In its official Opinion on Romania in the context of preparations for enlargement, the EU Commission has stated that &ldquo;negotiations under way with the Orthodox Church should soon permit the Uniate Church to recover its property&rdquo;. Ireland will continue to keep the matter under review both in our EU and multilateral contacts and directly with the Romanian authorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate air traffic control arrangements in the UK are a matter for the UK authorities. However, I can assure the Deputy that safety is the paramount consideration in the provision of air traffic control services internationally whether it be in Ireland, the UK or in any other state that is a member of ICAO &mdash; the International Civil Aviation Organisation which sets the overall safety standards.  I would therefore, wish to allay any concerns the Deputy might have about the safe operation of Irish aircraft.  Over the past few years there have been very significant increases in the level of air traffic in Europe and elsewhere and because of such increases, delays are imposed on traffic, when and where necessary, to maintain system safety standards at all times.</P>

      <P>As Ireland is party to the EU Treaties, we must pay our contributions to the EU budget.  EURATOM activities form part of this budget and the expenses of EURATOM are financed directly out of the general EU budget.</P>
      <P>The EURATOM Treaty remains the main framework for dealing with nuclear matters within the European Community.

    <P>I should add that the EURATOM Treaty encompasses some important provisions for the protection of health and safety of workers and the general public.  Article 30 of the Treaty provides for basic safety standards which must be laid down within the Community for the protection of the health of the general public and workers against the dangers from ionising radiation. <Col N="387" /> My Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are actively involved in making preparations for the introduction into Irish law of Directive 96/29/EURATOM which sets out new revised standards of safety in this field.</P>

      <P>The three objectives of Irish energy policy are competitiveness, security of supply and environmental compatibility and it is expected that these will continue to be the main drivers of policy in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant developments in the energy sector in recent years has been the increasing trend towards liberalisation of energy markets globally.  At EU level, two directives have been adopted in the recent past providing for the introduction of competition into the electricity and gas markets.  Earlier this year my Department issued a consultation document setting out the legislative proposals for the implementation of the electricity directive and work has commenced on proposals for the gas industry. This legislation will pave the way for the development of a competitive energy supply industry in Ireland into the new millenium by encouraging new entrants into the electricity and gas markets.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the strong growth in energy demand will continue in line with our economic growth.  However, major improvements in energy efficiency in recent years mean that while GDP is expected to be 80 per cent higher than 1990 levels by the year 2000, our energy consumption is forecast to increase by 30 per cent in the same period. Continued improvements in energy efficiency will help to further contain this growth.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 227 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>The Director of Telecommunications Regulation is responsible for the issuing of licences for both telecommunications infrastructure and service provision.  I have no function in the granting of such licences to Cablelink.  It is the Government's policy that the Cablelink system should be upgraded as a platform for the provision of a full range of multimedia services, including full telephony services.  The necessary investment for this upgrading will be raised by the sale of Cablelink.  Cablelink is set to become a strong competitor in the high growth telephony and multimedia market in Ireland and recently announced its plans to introduce a high speed Internet service.</P>

      <P>I have received a final report from ETSU recommending the WaveGen Ireland proposal as winner of the wave energy-to-electricity section of the AER III competition.</P>
      <P>I noted in the final report that the winning applicant had applied for 1.24 MECU in European Regional Development Fund grant aid under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme for the project, provision of which was subject to the approval of the monitoring committee of the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme and the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee, which includes the European Commission, has decided not to provide grant assistance for the wave energy station from the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme.  It is the committee's view, based on an assessment of the project by the committee's independent evaluator, that wave technology has not advanced sufficiently beyond the research stage to justify assistance under this particular Operational Programme.  In theory, Ireland has considerable potential for generating electricity from wave power.  I believe it is important that we begin to harness that power and for that reason I am prepared to consider nominating the project to receive an offer of a power purchase agreement at its bid price.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238, 239, 242 and 254 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the UK nuclear industry, in particular Sellafield, has long been a source of grave concern to successive Irish Governments.  This Government is totally committed in its opposition to the Sellafield operations and will continue to work towards a cessation of nuclear activities at the site.</P>
      <P>Over the past 12 months, my Department has been involved in making a number of submissions to the UK Environment Agency in the context of public consultation processes held by the agency about Sellafield.  On 16 March 1998, two separate submissions were forwarded to the agency detailing Ireland's concerns about an application from BNFL to the agency for a variation in the Sellafield Radioactive Discharge Authorisations and an application by BNFL to the agency to commission a mixed oxide fuel fabrication plant</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" />&mdash; MOX &mdash; at Sellafield.  I am awaiting the decision on these crucial applications.</P>
    <P>In the case of radioactive discharges, there was a very positive development in Portugal, in July, at the ministerial meeting of the OSPAR Commission, held to discuss the OSPAR Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic.  At the meeting, which I attended, the OSPAR Ministers adopted a strategy on radioactive substances which incorporates a commitment by the contracting parties to this convention to achieve close to zero radioactive discharges into the marine environment by the year 2020.</P>
    <P>In effect, this means that the UK Government will be obliged to achieve close to zero discharges of radioactive substances into the Irish Sea by the year 2020.  In keeping with this commitment, the UK authorities have requested BNFL to prepare &ldquo;forward-looking&rdquo; strategies for reducing discharges over the next twenty years.</P>
    <P>As to the naturally occurring or &ldquo;background&rdquo; levels of radiation in the Irish Sea, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; point out that the main pathway for radiation exposure is the consumption of seafood.  The RPII's report on Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment 1996 and 1997 concluded that a heavy fish consumer would receive 150 microsieverts in &ldquo;background&rdquo; radiation. This compared with 1.4 microsieverts radiation exposure to the same consumer originating from Sellafield discharges in 1997.</P>
    <P>As a result of commitments made within OSPAR, artificial radionuclide concentrations in the Irish Sea will be close to zero by 2020, leading to a further reduction in the already comparatively small radiation exposure to a heavy fish consumer which is Sellafield originating.  The progressive and substantial reduction of Sellafield's discharges between now and 2020 will have the added advantage that it will help to allay legitimate concerns about the impact of radioactive discharges.  I believe that the positive commitments made have the potential to assist in the preservation of sea-based livelihoods which might otherwise be at risk due to contamination of the Irish Sea.  The promotion of consumer confidence in seafood and sea produce and the use of the amenities of the Irish Sea should benefit from the OSPAR decisions.</P>
    <P>The most recent contacts with Minister Meacher were during the meeting of OSPAR Ministers in Portugal.  I found these discussions helpful in gaining an insight into current UK thinking about Sellafield and particularly the UK Government's wish to address public concerns about the impact of Sellafield discharges.  I have no immediate plans to meet Minister Meacher in the near future but I await with interest the outcome of forthcoming decisions concerning the Sellafield discharge authorisations in the aftermath of OSPAR.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased with the progress made at <Col N="396" /> OSPAR in relation to radioactive discharges, the agreement will not directly address our concerns about a number of the nuclear operations at Sellafield.  Unfortunately, there is no evidence at present that the UK Government intend to close the Sellafield reprocessing plant.  We will continue to highlight our concerns, both directly with the UK authorities and at relevant EU and international fora, about the continuation of reprocessing activities at Sellafield; the storage on-site of high level radioactive liquid waste; the operation of Magnox reactors beyond their design life and proposals for a MOX fuel manufacturing plant.</P>

      <P>The incident to which the Deputy refers occurred on 3 August last in the mixed oxide fuel &mdash; MOX &mdash; demonstration facility at Sellafield.  There was a minor release of radioactivity which was contained within the building.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute &mdash; RPII &mdash; received information early on 4 August last. The incident, which occurred in a laboratory in the MOX building, involved a torn protective glove in a glove box used for hazardous work. Radiation alarms were activated and personnel were evacuated from the immediate area.  One person was found to have been contaminated and was sent to the site surgery for examination.  Testing showed that there was no internal contamination and all external contamination was removed.  Other personnel involved were monitored and everyone was found to be clear of contamination.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that the incident did not have any radiological consequences for Ireland.  However, any such incident can give rise to public concern about the possibility of a nuclear accident which would affect us.  My concerns about incidents at Sellafield will continue to form part of formal discussions between Irish and UK officials on nuclear safety matters.</P>

      <P>The EU Large Combustion Plant Directive (88/609/EC) regulates emissions of SO2 and NOx from large scale industrial plant. National commitments under protocols to the UN-ECE Geneva Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution also apply, however, and the voluntary arrangements entered into between the ESB and Government in this regard are more stringent.</P>
      <P>Under the Geneva Convention Protocols, Ireland must limit national NOx emissions to their 1987 levels from 1994 onwards and reduce national SO2 emissions by 30 per cent on their 1980 level from 2000 onwards.  Applied on a <i>pro rata</i> basis to the power generation sector, NOx and SO2 emissions reductions of 42,000 tonnes and 82,000 tonnes per annum respectively have been agreed between the ESB and Government.</P>
      <P>ESB reports on its emissions on an annual basis to the Department of the Environmental and Local Government and to the Environment Protection Agency.  ESB has met its commitments in the past and has plans in place to ensure compliance in the future.  These plans include the additional use of gas, low sulphur oil and coal and the installation of additional low NOx burners at power stations.</P>
      <P>The agreement between the ESB and Government regarding limitations on SO2 and NOx is a voluntary one and my Department is kept apprised of the ESB's performance in meeting these voluntary obligations.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming measures necessary to implement the EU electricty directive are likely to result in the present voluntary agreement with the ESB being superseded by industry-wide arrangements to take account of new entrants to the market, in order to ensure that SO2 and NOx reduction commitments continue to be met.</P>

This phase will see the necessary minimum provisions being put in place to establish a regulatory regime for the electricity sector. Further legislation to give full effect to the directive is scheduled to follow next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I envisage that this initial Bill will include a range of provisions, which reflect the Government's commitment to sustainable development. The proposals include: a provision for the regulatory commission to exercise its functions under <Col N="398" /> a range of duties which include taking account of the protection of the environment, as well as promoting safety, efficiency and economy of electricity undertakings; a provision that plant authorisations will be granted subject to criteria laid down by the Minister as required under the EU electricity directive.  These criteria may include safety and security of the electricity system, protection of the environment and energy efficiency; a provision for the Minister to give directions to the commission regarding the imposition and recovery of the cost of public service obligations including those relating to environmental protection; a provision designed to take account of the alternative energy requirement programmes conducted by the Minister; and an enabling provision for consumers to purchase electricity generated from renewable energy.</P>

      <Quest>whether EU Directive 90/313/EEC on access to environmental information and SI No. 185 of 1996, which is the relevant implementing regulation, will apply in full to any new body to be established under the forthcoming electricity Bill; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>S.I. 185 of 1996 has been repealed by S.I. 125 of 1998 which provides that all public authorities, having public functions and responsibilities, and possessing information relating to the environment, shall, notwithstanding any other statutory provision and subject only to the conditions and exceptions provided for, make available to any person who requests it any information relating to the environment to which the Statutory Instrument applies.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the forthcoming Electricity Regulation Bill is to implement in part EU Directive 96/92/EC concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity.

Further legislation to give full effect to the directive is scheduled to follow next year.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming Electricity Regulation Bill provides for the establishment of the electricity regulatory commission.  Given that the commission would fall within the definition of a public authority as outlined in S.I. 125 of 1998 i.e. it will be a body established by statute and will have public administrative functions and responsibilities and will possess environmental information, the provisions of the statutory instrument would apply to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 251 and 252 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain firstly that the board of CIE has a statutory responsibility under the Transport Act, 1958, in relation to the safe operation of its services and I have been assured that safety is the priority consideration in the operation of the railway.</P>
      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy is an independent safety review of railway infrastructure which was carried out earlier this year for Iarnród Éireann by consultants A.D. Little.  The consultants' brief was to examine the track and signalling infrastructure on the railway lines with jointed track.  The consultants identified a number of areas where work will be required over the coming years, including the stretch of line from Mullingar to Sligo mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I commissioned a strategic review of all aspects of rail safety to be carried out by consultants, International Risk Management Services &mdash; IRMS.  In addition to the infrastructure aspects looked at by A.D. Little, the IRMS brief extends to an examination of rolling stock, overall safety policy and on-the-ground safety practice.  The review, which will take into account the A.D. Little findings, is expected to <Col N="401" /> be completed within the next month and it is my intention to publish it.</P>
    <P>Arising from the A.D. Little report, I asked CIE to prepare a railway safety investment plan which I will consider in conjunction with the IRMS report when it comes to hand.  When I have completed my consideration of these reports I will make appropriate recommendations to Government at an early date.</P>
    <P>As part of the reallocation of the Luas EU assistance, additional track renewal expenditure of £26 million was approved in June.  This includes an extra £14 million which will enable track renewal work on the Mullingar to Carrick-on-Shannon section of the Sligo line to be completed. This in turn will reduce the risk categorisation of this line in the context of the A.D. Little report.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in response to a request from the Department of Finance my Department has made an initial submission on EU funding for public transport projects in the post-1999 period. The submission takes account of proposed investments identified by CIE in a review carried out earlier this year and includes proposals for the Mullingar to Sligo line.</P>

      <P>The European Commission's &ldquo;Communication from the Commission to the Council, the Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on a Community strategy to promote combined heat and power (CHP) and to dismantle barriers to its development&rdquo; recommends that the European Union should endeavour to increase CHP to 18 per cent of gross electricity production by 2010.</P>
      <P>Ahead of the liberalisation of the electricity market in Ireland it is not possible to estimate the potential level of penetration of any power generation technologies, combined heat and power included, and to estimate the likely impact of any individual technology on electricity costs for the domestic consumer.  In the context of the Green Paper on substainable energy, I will examine how Ireland can contribute fully to achieving the EU target.</P>

      <P>The Government is commmitted to the continuing development of competitive multi-media and telecommunications sectors, since they are key factors in sustaining the development of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>The prime consideration in the sale of Cablelink is to ensure the upgrading of its network to enable it to become an important provider of a range of advanced multi-media services including digital television, internet, telephony, and value added services such as data services, messaging, near-video-on-demand, video conferencing and interactive services such as home shopping and home banking.  Cablelink is set to become a strong competitor in the high growth telephony and multi-media market in Ireland and recently announced its plans to introduce a high speed Internet service.</P>
      <P>A steering group has been established representing all the interests involved to manage the sale process.  This group is chaired by the Department of Public Enterprise, representing the Government, and also comprises representatives from KPN/Telia, the strategic partners in Telecom Éireann, Telecom Éireann and RTE.  This group is arranging for the full disposal of Telecom Eireann's and RTE's shareholdings in Cablelink through a trade sale process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale of Cablelink Ltd.  requires expert consultants to advise and assist in relation to the sale. Following a competitive tendering process N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Limited were appointed to advise on the sale.  Preparations are in hand to <Col N="403" /> issue an information memorandum to potential bidders.  This memorandum will issue once the Director of Telecommunications Regulation has clarified the future licensing regime to apply to the company which is expected shortly.  The process will then involve bidders in preparing initial indicative bids from which a shortlist will be selected.  This will be followed by a detailed &ldquo;due diligence&rdquo; process performed by each of the shortlisted bidders, final negotiation of the sale and purchase agreements and formal completion of the sale.  The sale process, subject to final regulatory approvals, is expected to take three to four months from the issue of the information memorandum.</P>

In addition, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom have been retained as international counsel during the course of the IPO process.</P>
      <P>Such expert financial and legal advice will be very important in terms of determining the details of the IPO such as the amount of shares to be sold and the structure of the offer.  I can, however, say at this stage that it is the Government's intention that the public will be able to subscribe for shares in the IPO.  As members of the public, Telecom Éireann's customers will, of course, be able to subscribe for shares but the detailed terms of any public offer will not be settled until much closer to the flotation date.  Decisions on the size and structure of the offer will only be made in the period leading up to the flotation.  At this stage, the IPO is being targeted to take place around mid 1999, depending on market conditions.</P>
      <P>Preparatory work is at an advanced stage in my Department on the legislative changes necessary to enable the IPO to proceed and to make legislation pertaining to Telecom Éireann compatible with its subsequent status as a publicly quoted company.  It would be my intention to bring the draft Bill to Government over the coming months.</P>

      <P>The peat review group, comprising representatives of my Department, ESB and Bord na Móna, was set up in August, 1993.  Its mandate was to identify opportunities to increase the long-term usage for milled peat in electricity generation in an efficient and economic manner for all the interests concerned.  The group reported in February, 1995.  The optimum scenario identified in the report, which was accepted by the boards of ESB and Bord na Móna, comprised: (1) the proposed closure of a number of units in the existing stations, (2) a refurbishment programme by ESB in other plant and (3) the development of the new 120 MW peat station in the east midlands.</P>
      <P>The refurbishment programme for the existing stations coupled with the commissioning of the new 120MW station represents a long-term strategic approach to ensure the continued use of peat in electricty generation.  It also maximises long-term employment in peat production and electricity generation in the midlands.</P>
      <P>The new 120MW peat station is due to come on stream in 2001.  A 20MW unit at both Rhode and Ferbane are effectivley no longer operational and two further 20MW units at Ferbane and one 20MW unit at Rhode are due to be decommissioned before 2001.  The precise decommissioning dates will have to be synchronised with ESB's refurbishment proposals for the other units at these stations.</P>

      <P>My Department has undertaken an extensive consultation process to date regarding implementation of the EU electricity directive in Ireland which is due by February 2000.  The Directive requires that approximately 28 per cent of the Irish electricity market be opened to competition at that time, rising to about 32 per cent within three years.  Proposals for implementing the directive were published in May 1997, a discussion forum was held in January 1998 and a further consultation document was published in May 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to publish shortly the Electricity Regulation Bill to establish an independent regulatory regime for the electricity industry with a view to it being enacted before the end of the year.  The current legal situation is that ESB require my approval under the Electricity Supply <Col N="405" /> Acts for capital expenditure on any new plant. Private companies, on the other hand, wishing to enter the market in competition with ESB, require a permit from ESB under the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  ESB is therefore currently in a position of operating in the market and at the same time regulating the entry of competitors.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have been advised by the Attorney General that it is essential to arrange for the immediate establishment of an independent regulatory commission to oversee the electricity sector.</P>
    <P>The comments received in response to the May 1998 consultation document were considered when preparing the heads of the currently proposed Bill and will be further considered when preparing the balance of the legislation for the full implementation of the EU directive which will follow next year.</P>
    <P>Legislation will also be required next year to deal with the conversion of ESB from a statutory corporation to a public limited company under the Companies Acts.</P>

      <P>In November 1996 the Irish Aviation Authority &mdash; IAA &mdash; presented proposals for a new Air Traffic Control Centre <Col N="406" />&mdash; ATC &mdash; at Shannon.  Following a rigorous appraisal of the authority's proposal the then Minister of State, Deputy Emmet Stagg, on 15 April 1997 conveyed approval in principle for the authority to proceed to the detailed planning stage for the development of a new air traffic control and training centre at Shannon.  A further proposal for equipping the new ATC facilities was submitted to my Department on 17 June 1998.  Following consideration of this project I conveyed my approval to the chairman of the authority to proceed to tender for the new equipment.</P>
      <P>The authority's contracting and tendering arrangements encompass the EU utilities and the Government public procurement procedures.  The procuremennt of the building services and air traffic mangement systems and equipment for its new air traffic facilities are accordingly carried out in strict conformity with the foregoing procedures.</P>
      <P>The authority has now commenced the tender process.  The criteria for the award of the air traffic management equipment contract was published as part of the notice of competition placed in the Official Journal of the European Commission (OJEC) on 29 July 1998 &mdash; TED-Ref. 96374-98.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State in the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no increase in gas prices to householders.  The current price of gas, which has not been increased for over ten years, will continue at least until the year 2000.  Since early 1997 Bord Gáis Éireann has been importing increasing quantities of natural gas from the North Sea to supplement the declining supplies of Kinsale Head Gas.  Practically all natural gas used by customers in Dublin is now imported through the Ireland-UK gas interconnector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purchase price paid by BGE for natural gas is based on the calorific value &mdash; energy content &mdash; of the gas.  The imported gas has a higher <Col N="407" /> calorific value than Kinsale Head gas, i.e. a lesser volume is required for the same energy output.</P>
    <P>Customers using North Sea gas continued to be billed on the Kinsale Head gas calorific value until April 1998 when BGE increased the conversion factor to account for the higher calorific value of the imported gas.  A conversion factor is applied to each bill to convert the customer's gas consumption, measured in terms of volume, to the unit of billing, i.e. kilowatt hours.  This does not mean an increase in the price of gas to the customer &mdash; the amount of North Sea gas required for a given energy output is less than what would be required to produce the same energy output using Kinsale Head gas.</P>
    <P>The figures referred to by the Deputy reflect the change in the conversion factor from 10.7997 to 11.5186, and not the unit price of gas.  The calorific value of imported gas can vary over time because gas is supplied from a number of different gas fields in the North Sea.  Consequently the conversion factor will continue to vary.</P>
    <P>My approval is not required for the application by BGE of the relevant conversion factor to billing.  BGE has assured me that the methodology for determining calorific values is based on best international practice and is directly comparable with the approach taken in the UK.</P>
    <P>Under the Gas Acts, my powers in relation to gas prices are limited to the giving of general directives to BGE concerning its pricing policy as to the sale and supply of gas.</P>

      <P>The question of employee share ownership schemes in commercial State companies will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.  I am in no doubt that in the right circumstances such schemes can be of benefit to the company, the staff and the wider economy.  There are certain guiding principles which are to be applied in all cases: employees can be offered shares in return for agreement to genuine restructuring and to changes in work practices which make the company more competitive, provided the value of the shareholding is commensurate with the value of the agreed changes and that those changes are not also being paid for in some other way; the transfer of those shares must be linked in some measurable way to the implementation of the agreed restructuring and agreed changes in work practices; it may also be possible for employees to buy additional shares at market value; purchase of these additional shares should not involve recourse to the company or to the State to fund their purchase.</P>
      <P>Finally, a critical test in any change of shareholding arrangements for State companies is that there must be benefit to the economy.</P>

      <P>The current reform process for the Defence Forces is the most far-reaching and wide-ranging the organisation has faced since its foundation.  It is a most complex process and one which cuts across all areas of military life.</P>
      <P>At present, arrangements are well advanced with regard to the reorganisation of Defence Forces headquarters.  The new Defence Forces headquarters' organisation will come into operation tomorrow, Thursday, 1 October 1998.  Work is being expedited in carrying out the other major changes due under the reorganisation programme such as the almagamation of infantry battalions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> Under the organisation plan, the 3rd Infantry Battalion stationed in the Curragh and the 30th Infantry Battalion stationed in Stephen's Barracks, Kilkenny are being amalgamated.  It is not normal policy to disclose details of the number of personnel deployed in any particular post, barracks or unit of the Defence Forces.  However, the deployment of troops in any area at any one time is a matter for the military authorities taking into account the operational requirements of the Force.</P>
    <P>The necessary infractructure exists in Stephens Barracks to cater for the amalgamation.  Standard repair and maintenance work is carried out in the barracks on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>I understand that Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny, which is of pre-Georgian vintage, is listed under category 2 of the Kilkenny City Development Plan &mdash; buildings of regional importance.</P>
      <P>Over the past ten years, in addition to routine maintenance and repairs, about £1 million has been spent on works at Stephens Barracks.  No special projects at the barracks are provided for in the current expenditure year.  The allocation of financial resources to major works in military barracks in respect of 1999 will be decided on the basis of the relative priority of the various competing projects.</P>

      <P>One of the objectives of the scheme of early retirement from farming is to improve the economic viability of holdings.  To this end, holdings surrendered under the scheme to younger farmers must be enlarged.  The case of this applicant is linked to another applicant under the scheme and because of the way in which the transfer of land was carried out between the two original holdings involved no actual enlargement of either holding was effected.  In the circumstances, the application cannot be accepted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 301 and 358 together.</P>
      <P>The import of pet cats and dogs into this country is governed by the Rabies Orders, 1972-76. There is free movement of these animals from the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as they share the same common health status.  Animals from all other countries must undergo a period of six months quarantine in a premises approved by my Department.  These requirements are designed to eliminate the risk of rabies being brought into the State by animals incubating the disease.  Entry is by way of import licence and a strict surveillance regime is in place at all ports and other points of entry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noted the report of the Advisory Group on Quarantine, established by the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which was published last week.  The report recommends that, for cats and dogs travelling between Great Britain and the member states of the European Union, the European Economic Area, or rabies-free islands, the quarantine system should be replaced with a system involving vaccination, blood testing and microchip identification requirements.  The report also notes that a further period of up to three years would be required to enable the arrangements necessary to give effect to its recommendations to be put in place.  A three month period of public consultation has begun in the UK and I will be following developments closely.  In this regard, plans are already in train for Ireland to host a meeting of the rabies <Col N="423" /> control liaison group, which includes all participants in the common quarantine arrangements &mdash; Ireland, Britain, Channel Islands, Isle of Man &mdash; to take place later this year.  Changes which might be contemplated in the UK system of quarantine controls would hold potential for this country, given the common approach to rabies which both countries have followed over many years.</P>

      <P>The following changes in the operation of the REP scheme were introduced during 1998.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Revision of REPS in respect of NHAs and Commonages</i>
      </P>
      <P>The most significant development was the agreement of the European Commission to the new improved package of measures in REPS drawn up to address environmental conservation in Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) including Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and commonages. This new measure will be known as Supplementary Measure A and replace Supplementary Measures 1 and 2 of the existing scheme.  As a result increased payments will be available to farmers in these areas.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Improved Control Procedures for Organic Supplementary Measure (SM6)</i>
      </P>
      <P>The eligibility rules in relation to this measure were clarified in view of the large number of REPS applications involving this measure, where part of the area being claimed for was commonage, which is not capable of being farmed organically by a single shareholder.  Applicants with commonage land or grazing rights are ineligible to participate in the Organic Supplementary Measure (SM6).</P>
      <P>
        <i>Destocking under Supplementary Measures 1 and 2</i>
      </P>
      <P>The option of a destocking payment of 210 ECU/Livestock Unit (LU) combined with a reduced area payment under these supplementary measures was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Ten acre rule</i>
      </P>
      <P>The requirement that applicants who owned commonage land must have ten acres of privately owned or leased land to qualify the commonage land for payment was abolished.  In addition, the acceptance of new applicants to REPS with commonage land is now subject to the new arrangements for NHA commonages.</P>

      <P>Non-parasitic blotching of spring barley, rather than wheat, was more pronounced than usual this year.  The cause of this problem is uncertain with a number of factors, including light incidence and intensity being considered.  Intensive testing and research is currently being carried out throughout Europe and by Teagasc at the Oakpark Research and Development Centre. The results will be published in due course.</P>

      <P>A recent report on the cereals harvest prepared by Teagasc estimates total production this year at 1.88 million tonnes which is about 3 per cent below the 1997 harvest of 1.94 million <Col N="427" /> tonnes.  Preliminary estimates by the CSO indicate a drop of 2.76 per cent in the area under wheat, barley and oats.  Increased rainfall and reduced sunshine in June and July adversely affected grass growth.  While most farms coped well those on peaty and very heavy soils experienced significant problems.  While both yields and quality of cereals were variable, the results overall are generally satisfactory given the difficult growing and harvesting conditions this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 314, 318, 319 and 321 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £167 million has been made available under the current operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry for the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes which has been fully utilised.  This includes additional funding of more than £43 million <Col N="428" /> provided since June 1997 of which £15.2 million is from national Exchequer funds.  The additional funding has been used to cover existing commitments under the schemes.  There are currently no funds available to restore these schemes.  I regard the schemes as high priority and I am continuing to pursue the question of funding to enable their reintroduction in a more focused way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 315, 365 and 366 together.</P>
      <P>The difficulties in the pigmeat market derive mainly from surplus production within the EU coupled with weakness in international markets, notably Asia and Russia.  The situation in Ireland has not been helped by the loss of slaughtering capacity as a result of a fire in June at a Northern Ireland plant.  I have taken a number of initiatives at both national and EU level aimed at alleviating the situation for Irish pig producers.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the summer, I sought and secured increased export refunds from the EU Commission. In May last, the Commission increased the rate of refund on pigmeat exports and followed this with a further increase in August.  In view of continued weakness in the export market and in particular on the Russian market, I have again raised the question of a further increase this week at the Agriculture Council.</P>
      <P>I also sought the introduction of an aids to private storage scheme to support the market at this time.  The Commission also agreed to do this, and a very attractive scheme was introduced with effect from 28 September.  This will provide EU funding for the storage of up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat destined for export to third countries for up to six months prior to the shipment.  I have put a proposal to the Commission for an adjustment in the veterinary inspection fee to reflect the price payable to the producer at a particular time within the pig cycle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The backlog of pigs awaiting slaughter on the market which arose from the fire has now been <Col N="429" /> greatly reduced.  To deal with the problem, it was agreed jointly betweeen the IFA, the Irish Association of Pigmeat Processors and my Department, to put arrangements in place for Saturday slaughterings.  The recent purchase of a major pigmeat plant in Northern Ireland by the firm which owned the plant destroyed by fire should also help to alleviate the overhang of pigs on the market in the south.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia has recently launched a promotion campaign designed to encourage sales of pigmeat on the domestic market.</P>
    <P>All in all, I am confident that the range of measures taken in response to the weakness in the market will have the desired effect and that it will very soon become evident in the returns to producers.  I will keep the situation under review and with strong support from other member states I will continue to press the Commission to ensure that suitable export arrangements, including refunds, are in place to allow EU traders compete on world markets and to exploit every possible export opportunity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 and 322 together.</P>
      <P>EU Regulation 805/68 allows for the payment of suckler cow premium to small scale milk producers whose certified milk quota does not exceed 25,638 gallons or 120,000 kgs.  A change to this eligibility criterion would require an amendment to the Council regulation based on a proposal from the European Commission.  At this stage there is no such proposal from the Commission.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to provide additional access to suckler cow quotas must be seen in the light of the current Commission proposal under Agenda 2000 to reduce existing individual quotas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect, the regulations require that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1996 EU special beef premium scheme are made a comparison will be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money is to be recouped from those farmers who, had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The money so recouped is then to be used to make payments to those farmers who had more eligible animals under the 1996 schemes.</P>
      <P>A message to this effect was conveyed to all herdowners by way of an addendum to the pay orders at the time of issue.  The person named was paid BSE top-up amounting to £515.00 &mdash; £22.40 × 23 &mdash; based on the 23 suckler cows on which he was paid premium under the 1995 suckler cow premium scheme.  As the herdowner did not have eligible animals for premium under the 1996 suckler cow premium scheme the overpayment made must be refunded.</P>

      <P>Animals identified under that system and which are now being exported to an EU member state must be reidentified with double plastic tags and issued with passport documentation, which requires the dates of births to be recorded.

    <P>The main production areas for strawberries are the south-east with about 66 per cent production and Dublin-Louth-Meath area which represents about 30 per cent of production.

Production in the Dublin-Louth-Meath area is mainly for the fresh market.</P>
    <P>Some 40 per cent of the total production is sold on the fresh market, including some 5 per cent which is exported and 30 per cent which is sold via Dublin market or directly to retail outlets. Roadside sales directly by producers account for the balance, i.e., about 5 per cent of total production.</P>

      <P>The person named submitted two ten month special beef premium applications under the 1997 scheme.  However, as the person named did not submit an area aid application his entitlement under the premia schemes is restricted to 15 livestock units.  The person named has a milk quota of 10,177 gallons which is equivalent to 11.34 livestock units, using the national average yield of 897 gallons.  Therefore, he has an entitlement to 3.66 livestock units under the premia schemes which is the equivalent of 6.1 animals under the ten month scheme.</P>
      <P>The person named submitted an application in respect of four animals in February 1997 and an application in respect of nine animals in December 1997.  Payment has issued in full in respect of the four animals applied on in February 1997.  An advance payment of £216.40 issued in February 1998 with the balance of £108.21 and £16.91 issuing on 31 March 1998 and 12 June 1998 respectively.  Of the nine animals applied on in December 1997 only five were eligible on age grounds.  With the stocking density restriction, payment was due in respect of 2.1 animals and this payment issued in full on 20 July 1998.  Animals deemed paid as a result of stocking density provisions cannot be reapplied on.</P>
      <P>Since the person named did not submit an area aid application he does not have an entitlement to extensification premium.</P>

      <P>The disadvantaged areas appeals panel examined all areas from which appeals for reclassification were received.  In the case of Monaghan, the panel recommended some 38,000 hectares for reclassification, and this was accepted by the EU Commission in October 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of representations received in 1996, the data relating to Monaghan was re-examined, <Col N="437" /> and a number of additional areas were identified which satisfied the criteria for reclassification.  A submission was sent to the EU Commission in April 1997 requesting that these additional areas of Monaghan be reclassified as more severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>However, the Commission was, at that time, involved in discussions with my Department about overgrazing and environmental protection issues, and was unable to consider submissions relating to less favoured areas until these had been concluded.  As these issues have now been finalised, I am in the process of reactivating the proposal relating to additional areas in Monaghan, and I hope to bring the matter to a speedy conclusion.</P>

      <P>Some £242 million has been made available under the current operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry for on-farm investment measures and this money has been fully committed.  This includes additional funding of over £44 million provided since June 1997 of which £16.2 million is from national exchequer funds.  The additional funding has been largely used to cover existing commitments under the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 369, 417 and 422 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to the introduction of the rural renewal scheme, while I am aware that there is a lot of planned investment and work on hold pending the introduction of the commercial and industrial elements of the rural renewal scheme, I must add that under EU Commission Regulations on State Aid all business tax incentives must have the Commission's approval prior to their introduction.  However, no such EU constraint arises in connection with the residential tax incentives in the rural renewal scheme and for this reason I introduced the residential tax incentives with effect from 1 June 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been major problems arising in obtaining the necessary EU Commission approval for the business tax incentives despite the fact that they were discussed with the Commission in Brussels at meetings in February, May and July 1998.  The two business tax incentives in the rural renewal scheme are the capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of industrial and commercial buildings and the double rent relief for the lessees of such buildings. These same two reliefs were the subject of formal notification sent to the EU Commission at the end January 1998 in connection with an extension to the Custom House Dock Area in Dublin.  It was decided it would be advisable to wait until these two reliefs were processed by the EU Commission for the Custom House Dock Area before formally notifying them again to the Commission <Col N="445" /> for the rural renewal scheme given that the reliefs were the same in both cases.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the views of the Commission in regard to the first scheme should clearly be of assistance in framing the subsequent formal notification for the rural renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>However, as the Commission had not yet approved the Custom House Docks scheme by mid-September despite all my Department's efforts, it was decided that the Commission be formally notified immediately of the rural renewal scheme.  The formal notification was done on 17 September.  The timescale for dealing with the application is a matter for the EU Commission and every effort will be made to assist the Commission in processing the application as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to European Commission approval for the new urban renewal scheme is similar to that applying to the rural renewal scheme.  Both schemes were discussed in tandem with the Commission at meetings in February, May and July 1998, and were formally submitted to the Commission for approval on 17 September. Any decision on the designation of areas for inclusion in the new urban renewal scheme will be made as soon as possible after EU approval has been obtained for the scheme.</P>

      <P>The current non-life insurance levy is 2 per cent and not 2½ per cent.  The levy is imposed on almost all non-life insurance premia, the exceptions being reinsurance, health insurance, marine, aviation and transit insurance and export credit insurance. The yield from this levy in 1997 was £30.5 million. Similar levies exist in most other EU countries and, in general, at rates much higher than 2 per cent.  The levy was introduced to broaden the stamp duty base, thereby raising additional revenue. Consequently, at this stage, I have no plans to abolish this levy.</P>
      <P>A separate levy was brought into effect on 1 January, 1984 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to fund the Insurance Compensation Fund.  From 1984 until the end of 1991 the levy was charged at a rate of 2 per cent of gross premium income and paid by all non-life insurers. From 1 January 1992 until 1 January 1993 the levy was charged at 1 per cent.  This levy, which was not a taxation measure, ceased to apply from 1 January 1993.</P>

      <P>The 1994 urban renewal scheme has already been extended twice.  In the 1997 Finance Act the end-July 1997 deadline was extended by one year to end-July 1998 provided at least 15 per cent of the expenditure on the project had been incurred by end-July 1997.  This condition also applied when the scheme was given a further five month extension to end-December 1998 in the 1998 Finance Act.  The additional conditions associated with this extension are that an application for planning permission must have been received by a planning authority by 1 March 1998 and the planning authority must also certify that the failure to meet the end July 1998 deadline was due in its opinion to a significant extent, to unanticipated delays relating to obtaining planning permission or a fire certificate or legal proceedings or a number of other factors.  With regard to the issue of extending the time limit for a project under the existing urban renewal scheme, there is no precedent of the deadline being extended for an individual project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the inheritance of the family home, I remind the Deputy that in the 1998 budget, I extended the sibling relief scheme and introduced a new relief for other close relatives, other than children, where the threshold is £188,400 per child inheriting their family home.  This means that given certain conditions the value of the family home taken by inheritance by a beneficiary, other than a child, can be reduced by up to 80 per cent or £150,000, whichever is the lesser for the purposes of determining the liability, if any, to capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>The capital acquisitions tax treatment of cohabiting couples was discussed during the Committee Stage of the 1998 Finance Bill.  At that stage, I said that the issues involved are complex and that finding an amendment to the capital acquisitions tax code to deal with this problem, which would be in line with Irish law and the constitution has up to now proved difficult.  There are a number of substantial problems, including difficulties with definition, which have been identified in attempting to provide a general relief or exemption from capital tax treatment of cohabiting couples.  As the Deputy will no doubt appreciate, the general rule has been that tax law follows general law relating to marriage.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report later this year.</P>
      <P>However, with regard to inheriting the family home from either a close relative or from one's partner, I did indicate at that time, that the matter would be considered further in the context of the 1999 Finance Bill.  Consequently, the many complexities associated with this issue will be examined further over the coming months.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the matter referred to by the Deputy relates to a compromise penalty paid by the person concerned for release of a vehicle which had been seized by Revenue Officers on 9 January 1997 for evasion of vehicle registration tax.  The amount evaded was £1,300.</P>
      <P>Initially the sum sought for release was £600. However, following local representations, this amount was reduced to £300 on condition that the vehicle be removed from the State.  These terms were accepted.  The reduction in penalty took account of the particulars of the case including the financial circumstances of the owner of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the person concerned was aware of the requirement to register the vehicle and pay VRT.  In the circumstances, they do not consider that any further reduction in the penalty is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing VRT is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in an individual case.</P>

      <P>The Civil Service, as an employer, is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for people with disabilities, which includes ensuring that people with disabilities who are capable of effective performance in the jobs to which they aspire are not disadvantaged by reason of having a disability.</P>
      <P>Since 1994 a code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service has been in place.  The code of practice covers issues such as recruitment, reception and integration into the workplace, career development, accommodation, equipment, safety and evacuation procedures.  The implementation of the code of practice is monitored by a committee representative of staff and management.  In addition, in the context of the Strategic Management Initiative in the Civil Service, equality issues, including issues relating to the employment of people with disabilities, are being examined by a committee set up specifically for this purpose.</P>
      <P>As you are aware the policy in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is implemented by (a) from time to time holding competitions confined to candidates with a disability, (b) facilitating candidates with a disability when competing in open competitions not confined to people with a disability and (c) where possible, retaining staff who become disabled after their recruitment.</P>
      <P>As of 1 April 1998, there were 777 people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service, representing 2.8 per cent of the staff.  The fact that this has dropped below the target of 3 per cent is a cause of concern and the matter is being kept under review.  The heads of each Government Department and office have been made fully aware of the importance of reaching and maintaining the 3 per cent quota.  My officials are currently in the process of gathering the figures for 1 October 1998.</P>

      <P>Research journals, including professional educational journals, in book form, other than those which are issued as periodicals, attract the zero rate of VAT.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, where such periodicals are normally paid for by annual subscription, have their pages sequentially numbered by reference to the completed work and are supplied with a binder or are bound for no extra cost in book form at the end of the year, they are regarded as books and thus zero rated for VAT purposes.</P>
      <P>This approach ensures that the zero rate applies to most research journals, including those purchased by the libraries of the universities, research institutions and similar bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="450" /> In addition, the Finance Act, 1998 provided for a significant rationalisation of the VAT treatment of printed matter.  With effect from 1 May this year, the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent, rather than the standard rate of 21 per cent, has applied to magazines and periodicals generally, as well as to brochures and leaflets and other similar printed matter which is not purely advertising. Thus, those educational and professional journals which do not qualify for zero rating have benefited from this recent reduction in the VAT rate of 8.5 percentage points.</P>
    <P>If there are any particular cases causing difficulties, the Deputy should advise those concerned to contact the Revenue Commissioners, who will be glad to discuss the matter with them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the issue of out-of-town shopping centres affecting the commercial vitality of town centres, section 344 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 provides capital allowances for the construction or refurbishment of certain multi-storey car-parks where the relevant local authority certifies that it is satisfied that the car-park has been developed in accordance with criteria laid down by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government following consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Among the criteria which must be met in the development of a qualifying multi-storey car-park are that the car-park must support the objective of making the core area of the urban centre in which the car-park is located, the focus for the centre's commercial and business activity.  Furthermore, the planning and design of the multi-storey car-park must take account of the nature and character of the area in which it is located and the provision of the car-park must be supportive of the relevant local authority's traffic and parking management policies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1998 Finance Act I introduced a pilot rural renewal scheme for the upper Shannon area subject to EU approval.  The area covered by the scheme comprises of all of counties Leitrim and Longford, north County Roscommon, the western part of County Cavan and a large part of County Sligo.  The incentives available under the scheme consist of accelerated capital allowances for industrial and commercial buildings, double rent allowance for business tenants for activities approved by the EU Commission, and reliefs for the construction, conversion or refurbishment of certain rented residential accommodation which commenced on 1 June this year.  The business reliefs were submitted to the EU commission for formal approval on 17 September last.  It is hoped that this scheme will ameliorate the process of decline in the areas covered by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> With regard to the Deputy's queries concerning other measures addressing the problem of rural decline, this is a very broad question and one might argue that any measure which is directed at rural areas is tackling this problem. Examples of these would be the work done by the county enterprise boards, the Leader groups and the area partnerships.  Similarly, things like headage payments made to farmers or agricultural relief for gifts or inheritances of agricultural property, stamp duty relief on transfers of land to young trained farmers might also be considered as measures which address the needs of rural communities and the problem of rural decline.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is currently preparing a White Paper on rural development which will focus on the needs of rural communities and address issues raised by the Deputy. I suggest that that document will contain a more comprehensive picture of the issue than is possible to set out in this reply.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 383, 402 and 411 together.</P>
      <P>Proposals on the taxation of energy products were presented by the EU Commission in March 1997.  Since then, they have been the subject of examination by technical experts reporting to the ECOFIN Council.  No level of agreement has been reached in these discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can inform the House that the proposed directive suggests both increased existing taxes on items such as petrol and proposes new taxes on coal, gas and electricity.  There are also complex arrangements to assist energy intensive industries with both obligatory and optional provisions for relief from the tax suggested.  It is proposed that the EU would apply such taxes irrespective of any requirement for paralleling action by other non-EU countries, including the USA. <Col N="453" /> It is necessary from an environmental viewpoint to examine these proposals constructively. Nonetheless, while the imposition of a carbon tax &mdash; at either EU or domestic level &mdash; may influence both private and industrial consumers in their use of energy products, I would be concerned, as Minister for Finance, to ensure that any measure which is advanced to promote energy saving does not adversely affect Ireland's international competitiveness.  I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of such taxes would have on the Consumer Price Index and how any tax would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Deputies will acknowledge the validity of these concerns which have been conveyed to our EU colleagues.</P>
    <P>Details of the proposal are set out in Commission Document COM (97) 30 final, 97/0111 (CNS), dated 12 March 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 and 385 together.</P>
      <P>Gains in speculative transactions in the exchange market are already taxed here under the capital gains tax or income tax or corporation tax code, depending on whether the gain arises in the course of a financial trade, or whether it accrues to an individual or a company.  Losses on speculative transactions are also of course treated as allowable deductions for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>While I am aware of the Tobin proposal regarding a tax on speculative transactions.  I am not aware of any proposal to implement this measure on an international basis, at this stage. Furthermore in the light of EMU it may not be possible for Ireland to take action, in this way, on a unilateral basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> With regard to the provision of resources to poorer countries, the Deputy will be aware that a major priority of the Government as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium is to give increased aid to developing countries.  The amounts provided over the last three years from 1996 to 1998 have been as follows:</P>
    <P>1996 &mdash; £106 million</P>
    <P>1997 &mdash; £122 million</P>
    <P>1998 &mdash; £151 million (est)</P>
    <P>Finally, the Government recently announced its intention to contribute £31.5 million to help alleviate the crushing burden of debt on the poorest countries in the world.  Of this, £22 million will be given to the IMF and World Bank to assist in their programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 386, 387 and 395 together.</P>
      <P>The management of the national debt is a matter for which the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) has been delegated responsibility, under the provisions of the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been no formal meetings between officials of my Department and their counterparts in other smaller EU member states specifically about the management of Government debt after the introduction of the euro.  However, officials of my Department and the NTMA, along with representatives of similar organisations in other member states, participate in an <i>ad hoc</i> working group on debt redenomination and market conventions set up by the Monetary Committee in the autumn of 1997 &mdash; the purpose of this <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="455" /> group is to assist member states in dealing with the technical challenges involved in the redenomination of debt at the start of stage three of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I understand from the NTMA that, since 1992, some of its officials have had informal meetings on a regular basis with its counterparts in other smaller EU member states.  At two recent meetings, the implications of the euro for national debt management in smaller EU member states were discussed; I understand from the NTMA that no further discussions are planned on this subject.  I am aware of a newspaper report which attributed views to EU Commissioner de Silguy in relation to meetings between smaller member states, but I do not know whether the report accurately represents Commissioner de Silguy's views on this matter.</P>
    <P>As regards bond auctions, I understand from the NTMA that it does not intend to cancel any bond auctions announced in its calendar for 1998. I also understand from the NTMA that it is planned to continue with a calendar of bond auctions in 1999, subject to the ongoing review of the arrangements for issuance in the context of the changing euro market environment.  While the precise dates for auctions after 1998 have not yet been decided, I understand that they will take account of bond auction dates of other euro member states, in particular the larger states.</P>
    <P>The yield on Ireland's ten year benchmark bond fell from 6.3 per cent in August 1997 to 5.5 per cent in December 1997 and fell further to 4.93 per cent in July 1998.  I understand from the NTMA that this downward trend reflects, among other things, EMU convergence as well as an increased demand for Irish Government bonds, and that the latter augurs well for their sale in the deep, liquid, euro-denominated bond market. The NTMA feels that competition between euro area Government borrowers will increase greatly in the euro and that it will be faced with a major marketing challenge, which I am confident it will successfully meet.</P>

      <P>There are no estimates by my Department of the added value of services specified in the Deputy's question. The macroeconomic statistics &mdash; the national accounts published for the Irish economy by the Central Statistics Office and used in this Department &mdash; record only those transactions relevant to the measurement of Gross Domestic Produce in the economy.  I understand that the services to which the Deputy refers do not comprise part of GDP to the extent that money transactions are not involved.</P>
      <P>The national accounts are a comprehensive framework within which economic data can be presented in a coherent and consistent manner. They are subject to strict international guidelines under the new international system of National Accounts as amended within the EU to ESA 95, European System of Accounts, to meet the needs of member states.  These do not encompass the measurement of voluntary activity.</P>
      <P>However, just because community and voluntary activity is not measured in the national accounts is not a reason to dismiss the importance of the contribution to our society of the work carried out by this sector in terms of the services they provide to communities.  The contribution of the voluntary sector is supported by very significant amounts of Government expenditure in such areas as health, education and training, social welfare, equality etc.</P>
      <P>The role of the voluntary sector and its relationship with the State has been the subject of debate for many years.  In an effort to ensure that community and voluntary organisations can grow in a supportive and enabling environment, I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will be bringing forward a White Paper on the community and voluntary sector early next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to figures from the Revenue Commissioners which indicate that the number of income taxpayers with taxable income exceeding £100,000 increased from 2,100 in the 1993-4 tax year to 4,600 in the 1997-8 tax year an increase of 2,300.  Over the same period, the number of income taxpayers increased by 177,000 to 1.2 million.  Given that the percentage of taxpayers whose taxable income exceeds £100,000 is less than half of one percentage point of all income taxpayers, I do not consider the fact that the number has doubled a particularly meaningful statistic.</P>
      <P>The Combat Poverty Agency does not have any figures on the incidence of poverty in Ireland which cover the same period as the Revenue Commissioners' figures.  The agency has confirmed that the most recent figures on poverty levels available to it, is the ESRI's report entitled <i>Poverty in the 1990s.</i>  This report relates to the period 1987 to 1994 and shows a consistent fall in aggregate poverty between 1987 and 1994.</P>
      <P>The budgetary strategy in recent years is designed to strengthen the economy's capacity for sustainable employment, economic growth and social inclusion, in a low inflation environment while continuing to improve the public finances.  I agree with the widely held view that the best anti-poverty strategy is the creation of sustainable employment.  Over the last four years, the economy has grown at an average of 7.5 per cent per annum generating unprecedented increases in employment.  The unemployment rate has fallen by over a third &mdash; from 14.7 per cent in 1994 to 9.0 per cent.  Long-term unemployment has also fallen dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in unemployment will have reduced poverty accordingly &mdash; in 1994, households headed by an unemployed person constituted the largest single group of households in poverty.  There was also a high incidence of poverty among women in &ldquo;home duties&rdquo;.  A significant part of the additional employment in the <Col N="458" /> economy has been taken up by women formerly engaged in &ldquo;home duties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Budgetary strategy is currently underpinned by Partnership 2000, in which there is a commitment to invest an additional £525 million on a full year cost basis on the promotion of social inclusion over a three year period.  The 1997 budget allocated £273 million for this purpose and I allocated a further £282 million in the 1998 budget thus exceeding, in only two years, the three year commitment in 2000.</P>

      <P>Public servants have fared well under the local bargaining provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> (PCW).  The significant upward drift in the level of settlements, from the initial figure of around 3 per cent has imposed substantial additional costs on the Exchequer, over and above what was initially envisaged when the PCW was agreed.</P>
      <P>Despite this, there are still demands from some quarters for further increases in cases where local bargaining agreements under the PCW have already been finalised.  This is something that the Government can not countenance.  There is no basis for any group getting increases beyond those which have already been agreed within the terms of the PCW.  There can be no opening of existing agreements and all remaining negotiations must be resolved within the PCW cost parameters.</P>
      <P>As regards future developments, the level of increase provided for in the Partnership 2000 Pay Agreement is the same in both the public and private sectors and I am determined that, in the case of the public service, there will be no moving away from the cost limits agreed in Partnership 2000.</P>

      <Col N="460" /> Public and private sector pay movements can be compared by using the earnings series produced by the Central Statistics Office, viz.  those dealing with public sector average earnings, on the one hand, and those dealing with industrial earnings, construction earnings, and banking, insurance and building society earnings, on the other hand.  The table below sets out the increases in each sector in the one-year, three-year and nine-year periods up to December 1997 (the latest date in respect of which figures are generally available for the various sectors).  These figures indicate as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) increases in the public sector have been higher than those in banking, insurance and building societies but lower than those in construction over all the relevant periods, and</P>
    <P>(b) although the public sector increase was lower than that for industrial earnings in the year to December 1997, it was higher in the other periods.</P>

    <P>Note: *September 1988 &mdash; September 1997.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that (i) the December 1997 figures do not reflect a number of the more recent pay settlements in the public service, such as those involving craftworkers and gardaí, and (ii) the public sector average earnings index does not include the health sector, which accounts for about one-third of the public service.</P>
    <P>It is essential to have regard also to the expenditure implications of public service pay, given that the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill accounts for just over half of all current voted expenditure.  I should point out, in this context, that by the end of 1998 the paybill is expected to be nearly double what it was in 1989 &mdash; an average increase of nearly 8 per cent a year over the period 1989-98.  By way of comparison, aggregate inflation over the same period has been less than 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Excessive pay demands in the public service risk undermining the competitiveness of the entire economy by accelerating the growth in public expenditure, diverting resources away from required improvements in the quality of public services, restricting the scope for further tax reform, undermining our budgetary performance and ultimately leading to reduced employment in the economy.</P>
    <P>Further upward drift in public service pay would also increase pay pressures in parts of the <Col N="461" /> private sector.  This would have damaging effects on competitiveness and would be likely to make it more difficult to secure the support of private sector workers for an acceptable successor agreement to Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The emerging surplus this year will be used to retire our debt burden which in turn will reduce our debt servicing costs and release resources for more productive purposes.</P>
      <P>In the last budget I identified the reduction of the national debt as one of a number of strategic issues.  As I pointed out at the time, this country is still deeply in debt.  At the end of 1997, our national debt exceeded £30 billion which is equivalent to about £22,000 for every person at work. The interest costs alone are over £2 billion.  The freeing up of some of these resources will assist the Government in providing for the longer term needs of the economy.</P>
      <P>The National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) is a ten-year plan which was launched in April 1997 with a target of reducing the number of people in persistent poverty from 9-15 per cent of the population to 5-10 per cent.  It also includes the halving of the unemployment rate to 6 per cent and the long-term unemployment rate to 3.5 per cent by 2007.</P>
      <P>Considerable progress has already been made towards meeting these targets.  The unemployment rate has already fallen to 9 per cent and the long-term rate to 5.6 per cent, in March 1998.  There were substantial real increases in social welfare payments in 1997 and 1998 and especially for the elderly in 1998. In addition, the Government recently decided that all significant proposals coming before the Government be assessed for their impact on poverty-proofing.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Government is already well placed to meet the targets set out in the NAPS.</P>

      <P>Social welfare payment increases are not directly linked to either wages or prices.  At every budget the amount available for allocation is limited.  This means that social welfare increases have to reflect <Col N="462" /> the balance struck between the many competing demands for these limited resources.  That has been the approach in the past and will also be the approach in the 1999 budget.  Notwithstanding these constraints, in this year's budget, I provided for increases of £3 per week in personal rates, while qualified adult allowances rose by 3 per cent.  These increases were well above the expected rate of inflation and reflected substantial progress towards meeting the commitment in Partnership 2000 to implement, before the end of the Partnership, the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I also announced an increase of £5 per week in the full personal rate of all old age and related pensions, which gave these elderly people increases ranging from 6 per cent to almost 7.5 per cent, or at least three times the expected rate of inflation. Furthermore, all increases in social welfare payments were brought forward to the first week in June 1998, which meant that the new rates were payable for 31 weeks in 1998 as compared with 29 weeks in previous years.</P>
      <P>The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium also contains a commitment to increase the old age pension to £100 per week by the year 2002.  I hope to make some progress in this year's budget towards fulfilling that commitment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 400, 401 and 403 together.</P>
      <P>While the information sought on charities is not generally published, the Deputy will be aware that section 61 of the 1998 Finance Act introduced a scheme of tax relief for companies who make donations to bodies which have been granted exemption from tax on the basis that they have been established for charitable purposes only and have been authorised under the scheme. The Act specifically provides that the Revenue Commissioners may make available the name and address of any body authorised under the scheme and I will send the Deputy a list of these names.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether more general information such as details of tax exemptions granted to taxpayers, other than information covered by the 1998 Finance Act, should be made available to the public by the Revenue Commissioners is a matter for decision within the terms of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  That Act provides for the non-disclosure of information given to a public body in confidence, where disclosure would be likely to prejudice the giving of further similar information to that body from the same person or other persons.  The Revenue Commissioners have advised me of their view that the non-disclosure of information they receive in confidence in the ordinary way from taxpayers, including information received in the course of applications for exemptions, is an important element underpinning voluntary compliance with the tax laws and in maintaining public confidence in the tax system.  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of the release of the names and addresses of bodies granted exemption as charitable bodies is currently being considered by the Information Commissioner who is generally responsible for reviewing decisions not to release information under the Freedom of Information Act.  The information commissioner will decide whether or <Col N="464" /> not the maintenance of the confidentiality principle in this particular matter outweighs any public interest concerns.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that details are not available in relation to the cost to the Exchequer, in terms of revenue foregone, as a result of the granting of charitable exemption.  Such information could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should be aware that the role of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to charities is confined to consideration of applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from tax on the basis that they are established for charitable purposes only.  The issue of the general regulation of charities on the other hand is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The position is that under VAT (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 it is possible for individuals to obtain repayments of VAT expended on certain aids and appliances which assist persons with a disability overcome that disability.  For example, walk-in baths, lifting seats and chairs, hoists and lifters and stair lifts, designed for persons with a disability, as well as iron lungs and kidney machines, can qualify for relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no repayments of VAT available in respect of any general construction, as the provision of building work is regarded as a service for VAT purposes and is not, accordingly covered by the terms of the order.  An extension of the order on the lines proposed by the Deputy could be seen as the introduction of an additional zero rate of VAT and under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may maintain existing zero <Col N="467" /> rates but are prohibited from introducing new ones.</P>
    <P>I understand instead that there are direct grants available from the Department of the Environment and Local Government for the construction of facilities for people with disabilities and the operation and terms and conditions of the scheme is a matter for that Department.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that there is an income tax relief available in respect of interest on moneys borrowed for the repair or improvement of a taxpayer's main residence.  This relief is, however, subject to the normal ceiling on mortgage interest relief.</P>

      <P>Since the announcement of the pilot rural renewal scheme in the last budget my Department has been inundated with requests on behalf of areas seeking inclusion in the scheme.  It is the nature of schemes such as the rural and urban renewal schemes and the seaside resort scheme, that there will always be complaints from people who are just outside the boundaries of the designated area.  Yet the boundary line must be drawn somewhere, and somebody will always be excluded. Consequently, one will never be in a postion to satisfy everybody.  I would stress that this is a pilot initiative and that it is not possible to designate every part of the country.  I have no plans to extend the rural renewal scheme beyond the areas already selected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position with regard to the tax incentives for areas adjacent to airport enterprise areas is that these are subject to the approval of the EU Commission in the context of state aids.  Last December, the Commission decided to approve the tax reliefs for existing and some new enterprise areas in the context of state aids but the decision did not cover the regional airports enterprise areas scheme.  EU officials have since informed my Department that the rates relief and double rent relief will not be approved by the Commission whenever a submission is made to them seeking EU approval for tax designation at any of the regional airport enterprise areas. However, it is understood at present that there is no objection to the provision of capital allowances. <Col N="468" /> Therefore, when projects for the airports enterprise areas are approved by the Irish authorities and areas are then designated, they will be submitted to the EU Commission for approval in respect of the capital allowances.  It should be noted that the business incentives in the rural renewal scheme are also subject to EU approval.</P>

      <P>The exemption from the payment of the excise duty on the oil, imported or domestic used in a particular process was agreed prior to this plant locating in Ireland.  It was provided for initially in Statutory Instrument No. 126 of 1983.  Council Directive 92/510/EEC, having regard to Article 8 (4) of Council Directive 92/81/EEC, authorised the continuation of the exemption without time limit.</P>
      <P>The provisions set out in Directive 92/510/EEC were updated in Council Decision 97/425/EC.  Article 1 of that decision authorises the further exemption from the payment of the excise duty until 31 December 1999 and for its continuation from exemption to apply automatically for subsequent periods of two years, unless the Council decides unanimously before the end of that period, on a proposal from the Commission, that the exemption should be abolished or modified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EU level, Ireland stressed the need to retain the exemption in order to help secure employment in energy intensive industry in the EU, against competition from outside the EU, where no tax or very low taxes apply.  We also indicated that we would not oppose parallel treatment for any other similar EU industries and there are somewhat similar tax concessions in other EU states for plants of this type. <Col N="469" /> The Deputy will realise that the issue concerns the tax position of an individual company and it would not be usual, in such cases, to publish such correspondence.</P>

      <P>I recently approved the price increase from £1 to £1.50 of the National Lottery Company's main game, lotto.  The increase took effect on 26 September as part of a package for a major relaunch of the game.  The main reason for the increase in price &mdash; the first such increase since the lotto was introduced ten years ago &mdash; is to maintain and enhance the appeal of the game in the light of the increase in price of lotto players' dreams, e.g. the cost of houses.  This is not a price increase in the usual sense as prizes have risen in line with lotto charges.  All prizes have been increased by 50 per cent and the minimum guaranteed jackpot per draw is now £1 million.  A new prize category, &ldquo;Match 4 Plus Bonus Number&rdquo; has also been introduced.</P>
      <P>The price of a national lottery ticket in euros will not become relevant in practical terms until the year 2002.  The exact rate of exchange for the Irish pound will not be determined until 1 January 1999 and the euro will not be in use in cash form until the year 2002.</P>
      <P>The requirement to play two panels is an integral part of the design of the lotto game and there are no proposals to alter this at present.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to address the anomaly whereby lone parents returning to employment are taxed on part of their allowance which up until then was not taxed, in view of the fact that this is a disincentive to taking up employment.</Quest>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments are, therefore, reckonable as income for tax purposes, including the social welfare lone parent's allowance.  Treating <Col N="471" /> such payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</P>
      <P>The apparent anomaly referred to in this question relates to the operation of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
      <P>While the lone parent's allowance has always been taxable it is paid in full by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs without tax being deducted.  The extent, if any, to which taxation will actually arise in a given case will essentially depend on the level of other income that a recipient has in the same tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>
      <P>Where there is additional income leading to a tax charge, in order to collect the tax due on the allowance, it is necessary to reduce the taxpayer's tax-free allowance by an amount equal to the lone parent's allowance received.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the taxation of lone parents is that a lone parent receives personal tax allowances, i.e. basic personal allowance of £3,150 plus a lone parent allowance of £3,150, which are the equivalent to the personal allowances of a married couple, £6,300.</P>
      <P>Lone parents have, like other taxpayers, benefited from the general tax improvements introduced in the 1998 budget e.g. the increase in personal allowances of £250, the increase in the lone parent allowance of £250, the widening of the standard band by £100 and the 2 per cent reduction in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment benefit is taxable but is paid by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs without tax being deducted.  In order to collect the tax due on the unemployment benefit, it is necessary to reduce the taxpayer's tax free allowance by an amout equal to the unemployment benefit received.  In the case of the taxpayer in question, unemployment benefit of £580.70 was received since 6 April 1998.  This is a lesser amount than that shown on the certificate of tax free allowances sent to the taxpayers because the inspector was unaware that the taxpayer did not receive unemployment benefit during the month of May.

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's assertion that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concession) Scheme is unworkable.  The scheme, which is governed by the Statutory Instrument Number 353 of 1994, provides substantial benefits to members.  These benefits include exemption from the payment of VAT and vehicle registration tax on the purchase of a motor car, exemption from payment of the annual road tax, exemption from the payment of excise duty on motor fuel up to a maximum annual limit of 600 gallons per beneficiary used for the transportation of the disabled person, whether as a driver or as a passenger.  The scheme is estimated to cost the Exchequer in the region of £15 million this year.  There are, of course, constant demands that these substantial benefits be extended to other categories and individuals not within the scheme. These requests are considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The fundamental aim of social inclusion is clearly stated in the Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium.  This includes equal opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The strategy is carried through in the commitments made in Partnership 2000 and endorsed more recently in Ireland's Employment Action Plan published by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in April 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discrimination in relation to employment on a number of distinct grounds, including disability.  The process of bringing the Act into operation will commence as soon as the new equality infrastructure &mdash; the Equality Authority and Office of Equality Investigations &mdash; has been put in place; this is scheduled to occur during the first half of 1999.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Commission on the Status of People with a Disability which was published in November 1996 also set out a strategy for people with a disability.  The Government has made a number of fundamental policy decisions, arising from the Commission's report, which should lead, <i>inter alia</i>, to an increased level of employment and vocational training opportunities for people with disabilities.  One key decision is the proposed transfer of responsibility for vocational training and employment for people with disabilities from the Department of</P>
      <P>Health and Children to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly from time to time difficulties will arise from prejudices among uninformed employers and others in society when dealing with persons with a disability.  However, the National Rehabilitation Board and other organisations have made considerable inroads into lessening such unwarranted prejudice through various awareness training schemes for employers, which are carried out with the collaboration of employers' organisations.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to &ldquo;EUROCAT&rdquo; which is an EU project for the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies.  It has operated in Ireland since 1979 and covers the Eastern Health Board region and Galway County.

The study was based on EUROCAT data from five countries.  Ireland was not a participant.  The reason Ireland was not included in the study was that none of the landfill sites met the definition of &ldquo;toxic waste dump&rdquo; specified in the project.</P>

      <P>Long stay and respite care facilities for people with physical disabilities are provided in the Eastern Health Board area by the board and through grant aided voluntary organisations.  The board currently provides long stay facilities at Cherry Orchard Hospital, 22 beds, Cuan Aoibheann, Phoenix Park, 46 beds and Peamount Hospital, Newcastle, 25 beds.  Respite beds are provided at Cherry Orchard Hospital, 2 and the M.S. Care Centre provides eight respite places in Bushy Park, Rathgar.  There are five Cheshire Homes in the Eastern Health Board region providing long stay and respite care for more than 100 persons with physical disabilities.  These facilities accept referrals from all areas of the Eastern Health Board's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The provision of respite care has been identified in the report of the Review Group &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo; as one of the priority areas for development in services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of these services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the local co-ordinating committees for services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.  The voluntary agencies providing services in this sector are represented on these co-ordinating committees.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board was allocated £1.080 million for the development of physical and sensory disability services in its functional area in 1998.  I understand that the board, in consultation with its local co-ordinating committee, has decided to allocate £200,000 of this funding towards the provision of long-stay and respite bed facilities for people with physical and sensory disabilities in its catchment area.</P>

    <P>* Provisional figures.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the discussion document prepared by the Department of Public Health of the South-Eastern Health Board and to which the Deputy refers.  International evidence shows that the provision of sexuality and contraceptive education does not lead to an increase in the incidence of pregnancy among teenagers.  Irish policy in this regard is to provide appropriate sexuality and relationships education so as to encourage responsible decision-making by teenagers.  My Department's Health Promotion Unit assisted the Department of Education and Science in the preparation of the Relationships and Sexuality Education Programme, which was introduced <Col N="482" /> into both primary and second level schools in 1997.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to quantify the cost to the health and social services of dealing with unplanned pregnancies.  Health boards, voluntary agencies and general practitioners provide a range of family planning and counselling services. My Department has provided significant additional funding in recent years to enable these services to be developed.  Family planning services are available as part of the General Medical Service and, in addition to the provision of education and advice, a range of contraceptives may be provided.  Following the publication of the &ldquo;Women and Crisis Pregnancy&rdquo; study earlier this year, my Department requested the health boards to review the adequacy of the family planning pregnancy counselling services in their areas, having regard to the study's findings, and to indicate what further service developments they may consider appropriate.</P>

      <P>I am aware from reports of scientific reseach being carried out by this biotechnology company in the field of xenotransplantation.  I understand that international research into xenotransplantation has been ongoing for some years and has concentrated on the development of transgenic animals, primarily pigs with human genes, and on measures to combat the risk of infection and organ rejection.  Clinical interest in this option has been prompted mainly because of the shortage of human donor organs worldwide.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals under consideration within my Department to introduce xenotransplantation in Ireland.  The matter will be kept under review by my Department and developments will be closely monitored.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446 and 447 together.</P>
      <P>I understand from the health boards that there are a total of 12 children in care receiving intensive therapy outside the State at present as there was no appropriate facility to meet their needs in this country.</P>
      <P>The health boards in addition to placing children abroad have developed a variety of responses to try to cope with a relatively small number of very unmanageable children.  These include the provision of emergency facilities for individual children and the provision of a number of places in secure residential accommodation settings adapted to cater for such children.</P>
      <P>I have given the Eastern Health Board approval to proceed with the development of the unit at St. Ita's, Portrane.  Funding for both this unit and the unit at Ballydowd is included in my Department's Capital Programme.  Building of the Ballydowd unit is expected to commence at the end of this year while building of the unit at St. Ita's, Portrane is expected to commence next year.  The number of secure accommodation places available when these units come on stream will be approximately 60.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware the establishment of a social services inspectorate is a priority for my Department and funding is being provided in 1998 for the establishment of the inspectorate. The post of chief inspector has been advertised. Following the appointment of the successful candidate, arrangements will be made for the recruitment of further staff.  As well as its inspection role the inspectorate will work with the health boards in developing best practice in relation to the operation of these units.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 449, 476 and 477 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has taken steps to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to control and reduce the prevalance of MRSA and I am glad to inform the Deputies that significant measures have been taken in this area.  In September 1993 a committee on the control of MRSA comprising representatives from the Department of Health and Children, Consultant Microbiologists, Specialists in Public Health Medicine, General Practice, and the Infection Control Nurses Association was established to identify the extent to which MRSA was a problem in the Irish health system and to establish priorities for its control. The committee recommended a comprehensive set of guidelines covering procedures for the <Col N="507" /> management of MRSA in acute hospitals and other health care settings.  The committee also produced guidelines and information for patients and health care staff.  The guidelines were published in 1995.</P>
    <P>These national guidelines were endorsed by a wide range of professional bodies involved in the control of MRSA and were widely circulated throughout the country.  The guidelines are an important step in promoting awareness of MRSA and the measures for its control and will ensure an even safer environment for the care of the sick both in the community and in hospital, including persons undergoing surgery.</P>
    <P>A study of the prevalence of MRSA in Irish hospitals was carried out on behalf of the committee on the control of MRSA and I am committed to ensuring that future trends in the prevalence of MRSA will be closely monitored and, in this regard a follow up national survey on MRSA is currently being planned by the Eastern Health Board and will take place in early 1999.  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that a national disease surveillance unit is currently being established. This unit will build on the reporting systems which have been developed in some regions and will assist in the control of all communicable diseases, including hospital acquired infections such as MRSA.</P>
    <P>The EU Council of Health Ministers, on 20 July 1998, adopted a proposal at EU level which seeks to create a network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the European Community.  The network will operate through a system of close co-operation and effective co-ordination between member states.  The disease categories to be covered by the proposed network includes hospital acquired infections of which MRSA is one.</P>

      <P>The National Alcohol Policy was launched in September 1996.  The main thrust of the policy is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption.  Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the policy sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place.  The most significant of these are: the National Alcohol Surveillance Project has been established; a national lifestyle survey is being undertaken which includes items on alcohol consumption and alcohol related problems; a <Col N="508" /> National Alcohol Awareness Campaign was launched on 20 April 1998.  The overall message of the campaign is &ldquo;Control your drinking before it controls you&rdquo;.  The campaign materials consist of four posters and two radio messages which are designed to make people think about their drinking habits.  The campaign ran for an initial period of three weeks and the second phase is currently in operation.</P>
    <P>Work is ongoing on a number of the longer term elements of the action plan, including: developing the school curriculum to include a significant level of health education, based on a lifeskills approach; development of policies in relation to health promoting schools, hospitals, workplaces and campuses which would include policies in relation to alcohol use; discussions with the drinks industry on their response to the policy, with particular emphasis on the development of server training programmes.</P>

      <P>Pursuant to Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, the Childcare (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996 were introduced by my Department.  The purpose of the regulations is to build on the existing good standards in our pre-school services and gradually improve standards throughout the sector to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>These regulations apply to pre-schools, play groups, day nurseries, cre ches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services, which cater for children under six years of age.  The regulations require pre-school providers to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service.  Subsequent to receiving a notification the health board provides relevant information to the applicant and will make arrangements for an inspection to be carried out by an authorising person.  In view of the large numbers involved health boards have until mid 1999 to complete the first inspection of all the pre-school services concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Expert Working Group on Childcare, established under Partnership 2000 to devise a <Col N="509" /> national framework for the development of the childcare sector, is considering the issues raised by the Deputy in relation to the regulation of the childcare and childminding industry and will be making recommendations in the matter.  The expert group, under the auspices of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is expected to issue its report in December, 1998.  In addition, it is intended to review the Childcare (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996 after three years, with a view to effecting any change considered necessary at that stage.  I have no plans at present to introduce changes to the existing legal framework pending the outcome of these reviews.</P>
    <P>I might add, that the question of establishing a system of statutory registration for designated health and social professions has been under consideration by my Department for some time.  The groups concerned are physiotherapists, social workers, radiographers, chiropodists, childcare workers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, dieticians, environmental health officers, medical laboratory technicians and psychologists.  However, despite various initiatives over recent years, great difficulties still remain in devising a scheme which would meet all the requirements of the various professions and which would provide for a system of self-financing self-regulation.  This issue is once again being examined within my Department at present, with other models for statutory registration being investigated in an effort to overcome the difficulties in question.</P>

      <P>I am aware of recent reports suggesting possible linkages betweeen the product Roaccutane and depression.</P>
      <P>Roaccutane (isotretinoin) in a vitamin A derivative used in the treatment of acne.  In Ireland, it is authorised by the Irish Medicines Board for the treatment of severe acne, unresponsive to other treatments.  Its availability is limited in that it must be prescribed and its use monitored by a specialist dermatologist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medicines Board has, on an ongoing basis, been actively monitoring data on Roaccutane which it has reviewed both internally with experts and with the other European regulatory agencies.  In addition, the board has also recently reviewed the terms of the product authorisation with the company.  As a result of this, revised <Col N="510" /> wording for inclusion in the prescribing information for the product, outlining the current position regarding its use and warnings related to the possible development of psychiatric reactions were agreed.  The warnings refer to possible side effects including depression, pyschotic symptoms and of rare reports of suicide associated with Roaccutane.</P>
    <P>The revised warnings have been incorporated into the authorisation documents for the product and the company has circularised all physicians and pharmacists outlining the new warnings regarding the use of Roaccutane.</P>
    <P>As with all medicines, it is important that patients should read carefully any information and follow any instructions provided with the medication and consult with their physicians in relation to any problems, side effects or uncertainties they may encounter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 455, 456 and 457 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine educational psychological assessments for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.  As the psychological services provided by the Department of Education and Science to primary schools are still in the development stage and are at present limited to a small number of schools, health boards currently provide some services for school children on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.  The primary concern, however, of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessment and therapeutic treatment to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and developmental delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently published the report of the planning group on the establishment of a national educational psychological service to provide services for all primary and secondary schools.  Fifteen additional qualified psychologists have been appointed this year.  These psychologists will work in regional teams under the management of the psychological service in the Department of Education and Science.  It will clearly take time for the national educational psychological service to build up an increased level of service provision to children of schoolgoing age.  During this interim period it will be necessary for the developing educational psychological services to work with the health funded services to ensure that the available resources are applied as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>The detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to the provision of educational psychological assessments in the Western Health Board and the general position in the other health board regions is not readily available to my Department.  I have asked the boards to supply the information and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as it is available.  However, as I have already stated, the primary concern of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessement and therapeutic treatment to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and developmental delay.</P>

My Department will continue to participate fully in the work of the group which involves <Col N="514" /> the collaboration of other relevant Government Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the concerns of parents in relation to the provision of additional residential services to meet the needs of those who have been assessed as requiring these services.  This is particularly the case in relation to persons with a mental handicap.  The availability of detailed information from the National Intellectual Disability Database, which was launched last year, enabled my Department to publish in 1997, for the first time, a comprehensive assessment of the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  This report, An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, shows that there are now more adults with a mental handicap than at any other time in our history and that there is an ageing population in the more severe range of disability.  This has major implications for service planning and will, in particular, mean increased pressure on residential services for this age group.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to meeting the needs which have been identified in the Assessment of Need over the period in question.  Within the last twelve months, I have made additional funding amounting to £25 million available to the services to assist in meeting these needs.  This included the first phase of a four year national £30 million capital programme for the services which I put in place late last year and which will run in tandem with the development of services as outlined in the Assessment of Need.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 466 and 467 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive process of consultation with all interested parties relating to the proposed content of new mental health legislation began with the publication of the Green Paper on Mental Health in June 1992.  The Green Paper contained <Col N="515" /> proposals relating to a patient's capacity to consent to treatment including circumstances where a patient is unable or unwilling to give such consent but, based on clinical advice, treatment may be necessary in the interests of the patient.  The consent to treatment proposals, which will be contained in the new mental health Bill, have been drafted following widespread consultations with interested parties and will be broadly based on proposals contained in the White Paper, &ldquo;A New Mental Health Act&rdquo;, published in July 1995. The measures which I intend to incorporate in new legislation will be designed to ensure that patients who are incapable of expressing consent in such circumstances receive necessary treatment while at the same time have their interests fully protected.  The making of health care decisions by a nominated person on behalf of an incapacitated person has complex medico-legal implications and the provisions of the mental health Bill which I have outlined above should adequately protect the interests of such persons.  It is my intention to publish this Bill at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 468 and 469 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Health Act, 1970, health boards are required, under the general medical services scheme to provide, without charge, general practitioner services, drugs, medicines and appliances to persons with full eligibility i.e. medical card holders.</P>
      <P>Under the GMS scheme, general practitioner services are provided by doctors who are registered with the Medical Council under the statutory provisions of the Medical Practitioner Act, 1978, while drugs and medicines are dispensed by pharmacists registered with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland under the provisions of the Pharmacy Acts, 1875 to 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drugs and medicines which are considered necessary for any persons receiving services under the scheme must be examined and accredited by the Irish Medicines Board and covered by a current product authorisation.  The <Col N="516" /> granting of such an authorisation ensures that the medicinal products concerned have satisfied certain minimum standards regarding their quality, safety and efficacy before they are placed on the market.  The position is that complementary and homeopathic therapies are not the subject of such authorisations.  Accordingly, the minimum standards of quality, safety and efficacy have not been established for these products.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, remains that complementary and homeopathic therapies are not eligible for reimbursement under the GMS scheme and I have no plans to change the current arrangements in place.</P>

      <P>I am very much aware of the prevalence of skin cancers in this country.  Skin cancers are the most common form of cancer in Ireland today and my Department is actively involved in promoting greater awareness of this disease.</P>
      <P>The health promotion unit of my Department works closely with the European Commission and the Irish Cancer Society on the Europe Against Cancer Week campaign each year.  This is a European wide campaign which elaborates upon the ten point European Code Against Cancer by focusing on a single element of that code each year and concentrating effort on that area in particular.  In 1996 the campaign focused on skin cancers and for that campaign the Health Promotion Unit, in association with the Irish Cancer Society and the European Commission, produced a wide range of materials related to skin cancer which were disseminated nationally.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit has also provided support and funding for an awareness campaign by the Construction Employees Health Trust &mdash;&ldquo;Keep Your Shirt On&rdquo;&mdash; which outlined the dangers of over exposure to the sun and addressed the particular concerns of skin cancer for those working in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>The Health Promotion Unit also produces and disseminates nationally a skin cancer prevention leaflet entitled &ldquo;The Sun Seekers Guide to Health&rdquo;.  In addition the Health Promotion Unit continues to support the work of the Irish Cancer Society which produces a range of information materials on skin cancers including leaflets designed to highlight the dangers for particular groups including families and agricultural workers.  This year the focus of the Irish Cancer Society's skin cancer awareness campaign is on people involved in sport.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of health related support services to persons with a mental handicap, including speech and language therapy services, in the Monaghan region is the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board.  Health boards provide a speech and language therapy service to the community, including school children.  Where numbers justify it, a health board will provide a speech and language therapy class in a particular school.  However, the report of the Special Education Review Committee, which was published in 1993, recommended that speech therapists <Col N="519" /> working full-time in a school should be funded by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are currently five speech and language therapists and a principal speech and language therapist operating in the community care services in the Cavan-Monaghan region.</P>
    <P>Speech and language therapy services in all areas are in need of development.  Health boards regard this as a priority and 31 additional posts of speech and language therapists have been created in the boards in the last four years.  The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physicial and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in 1996, sets out the requirements for the development of these services, including speech and language therapy services.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the fact that developments need to take place at Portlaoise General Hospital and I feel that it is important that the services provided there, together with the infrastructure of the hospital, are at a level which enables the hospital to respond to the acute hospital needs of the local population.  I have visited the hospital and have received numerous representations from my colleagues about its development and it has been the subject of discussions with deputations received by me and by previous Ministers for Health.  I recognise that the needs of the hospital have to be addressed and I decry the fact that little has been done to address these needs in the last number of years.  I have instructed my Department to issue the necessary approval to enable a development control plan for Portlaoise to be drawn up immediately to be used as a basis for its planned development.  One area which deputations have raised with me as being a priority for development is the Paediatric Unit and I see this as a priority to be addressed.  The impending provision of the Acute Psychiatric Unit and the kitchen alterations and ward refurbishments at Portlaoise General Hospital, at an estimated cost of £8.5 million, represent a significant start to its planned development.</P>

      <P>The Health (Nursing <Col N="522" /> Homes) Act, 1990 gives powers to the health boards to enforce high standards of accommodation and care in nursing homes.  The Act also introduced a new system of nursing home subventions, so that dependent people most in need of nursing care would have access to such care.  This scheme is intended to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care, but it is not intended to meet the full costs involved.  The private or voluntary ownership of homes is fully respected and the setting of fees is outside the scope of the Act.  Accordingly, information on the levels of fees charged in private nursing homes is not collected by the Department.</P>
      <P>I might add that since coming into office, this Government has provided additional resources to health boards to increase the number of nursing home subventions and to provide more assistance to people who are experiencing difficulities in covering their nursing homes fees.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and the legal responsibility, under the Health Act, 1970, for the determination of eligibility for medical cards is with the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>I, as Minister for Health and Children, do not have a function in the issue of medical cards to individuals.  However, as the determination of eligibility of the person concerned is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the North-Western Health Board I have asked him to have the matter investigated and to reply directly to you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 501, 502, 503 and 504 together.</P>
      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991 imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work. Under the Act, it is also open to an applicant to request a registered adoption society to carry out an assessment.  However, there is no obligation on a registered adoption society to carry out such an assessment.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are different timescales for the completion of the assessment process in the different health boards.  This difference arises principally from the greater volume of applications in some areas, particularly in the Eastern Health Board.  Arising from the additional funding approved to the Eastern Health Board for child care services in 1998 the board has appointed three new social workers to its adoption service.  This will facilitate a speedier assessment of applicants who wish to adopt children abroad.  I understand that the current waiting time prior to assessment in the Eastern Health Board is nine months: a reduction of five months on 1997.</P>
      <P>My Department does not hold information on the average number of hours it takes to carry out assessments in each health board area and has not issued guidelines to health boards concerning the assessment process.  However, as regards second assessments, I would point out that while such assessments may not take as long as a first assessment there are a number of additional matters, including the progress of the first adoption, which must be taken into account and they cannot simply be considered an addendum to a previous assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> I have received a large volume of representations concerning both delays in commencing assessments and perceived differences between health boards in the assessment process itself.  I am not convinced that simply assigning more social workers to deal with an ever expanding case load is the most efficient way of dealing with this situation particularly when one considers the other areas of pressing need in our child care services. It is also necessary to consider how health boards can best utilise existing resources to manage cases and whether or not legislative change is required to assist them in this regard.  I have therefore decided to commission an independent consultancy to review the foreign adoption assessment procedures in the eight health boards with the aim of ensuring that an efficient and standardised assessment procedure which accords with best practice in the field operates across the country while at the same time having regard to the priority that must be attached to other areas of the child care services.  The terms of reference of the consultancy are as follows: (i) to review the current assessment procedures in health boards in consultation with relevant interests &mdash; this review should encompass both social work practice and service management; (ii) to provide an overview of the current assessment procedures in health boards which identifies any particular issues which need to be addressed; (iii) to propose a standardised framework for the carrying out of future assessments which accords with best practice in the field and delivers the service in the most efficient and sensitive manner possible. Within this standardised framework, health boards should be able to exercise a degree of flexibility in the management of the service and in the detail of its delivery so that they can adapt it to the particular circumstances prevailing in their functional area; (iv) to estimate the resource implications (on current application rates for assessment) of this proposed standardised framework (this estimate to include staffing levels, management and administrative requirements etc.).  The feasibility of introducing charges for assessments should also be examined in this context and (v) to highlight any areas in which legislative or administrative change would improve the quality of the assessment process.</P>
    <P>I have set up a small advisory committee comprising representatives of my Department, the health boards, the Adoption Board and the Council of Irish Adoption Agencies to oversee this consultancy.  This committee held its first meeting yesterday, Tuesday 29 September, and it is intended to put the consultancy out to tender within the next week.  Any proposals for legislative change arising from the consultancy will be considered in the context of the Bill to ratify the Hague Covention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption, 1993, which is currently being prepared in my Department.</P>
    <P>As an additional measure to tackle delays in commencing assessments I am at present exploring <Col N="531" /> the legal position and the feasibility of one or more registered adoption societies carrying out assessments on the basis that the costs of these assessments will be borne by the applicants.</P>

There has been an increase in activity of almost 4 per cent in the period January to June 1998 over the same period in 1997.  However, in order to facilitate various refurbishment works that agencies may wish to proceed with while staff are on annual leave as well as for budgetary reasons, agencies close beds mainly during the summer months. This has been a normal part of health service activity for many years.</P>
    <P>In addition the number of overnight hospital beds available does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.  For example, trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day case and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point acute hospital in-patient activity for January to June 1998 shows an increase of 1.11 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding in day case acvitity is 9.78 per cent.</P>

Each health board is currently examining ways of implementing the report's recommendations which impinge on health board services.  As regards the appointment of resource officers, I understand that three health boards have appointed such officers with the remaining health boards currently in the process of appointing officers.</P>

      <P>By way of background the chairman of the board of management of the hospital wrote to the Department in November last year indicating that the board had decided in principle to relocate its dermatology services to St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park.  The decision to relocate services, including psoriasis treatment, was endorsed by my Department on the basis that service provision at St. Vincent's Hospital would enhance the existing level of care for dermatology patients through the development of a more integrated service on one site.  The board subsequently reconsidered its decision to transfer services.  I understand that they are at present examining a number of alternatives for the hospital and these will be submitted to the Department when completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 514 and 515 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that an insufficient number of applicants for the 1998 psychiatric nursing registration-diploma programme who successfully came through the selection processes of the Nursing Applications Centre accepted offers of places at the schools of psychiatric nursing in the Mid-Western, North-Western and South-Eastern Health Boards.  The number of <Col N="534" /> acceptances for each of the three schools was, in fact, in single figures.  To proceed with the programme this year in the three schools would, therefore, not have been viable.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, my Department was left with no alternative but to shelve plans for an intake of psychiatric nursing students to the three schools in the current year.  I would stress that this decision was not taken lightly and that I share the deep disappointment of the nursing personnel involved in the schools who put so much work into preparing for the programme.</P>
    <P>The immediate concern was to try to find alternative places for the 20 applicants who had accepted places at the three schools.  Each of them was notified by the Nursing Applications Centre of the situation and offered a place in any of the other schools of psychiatric nursing that will be providing the registration/diploma programme to first year psychiatric nursing students this year.  These schools are operated by the Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards, St. John of God Hospital, Dublin, St. Patrick's Hospital, Dublin, and St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, Dublin.</P>
    <P>The approved 1998 intake for the South-Eastern Health Board school of psychiatric nursing was 25 students.  In the event, the school would only have had a class of eight first year nursing students.  Seven of the eight applicants affected have opted to avail of training places at the following schools: Southern Health Board (3), St. Patrick's Hospital (2), Eastern Health Board (1) and St. John of God Hospital (1).  The other applicant has been granted a deferral of the offer of a place on the programme until next year.</P>
    <P>I would like to clarify that none of the three schools concerned has been closed.  The actual position is that they are not proceeding with an intake of first year nursing students in the current year.  It would be my firm intention that training places in the three schools would be advertised next year as part of the arrangements for the 1999 intake of students to the psychiatric nursing registration/diploma programme.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, in the light of the disappointing uptake of places in psychiatric nursing training this year, my Department is examining the feasibility of putting in place a post-graduate training programme in the spring of 1999.  The question of the South-Eastern Health Board School providing such a programme will fall to be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>I might add that my Department is arranging to meet representatives of all of the schools of psychiatric nursing next month to review this year's recruitment process.</P>

      <P>Patients' private property is the term used to describe an allowance granted by health boards to patients in long-term care.  This allowance, in a majority of cases, is the residual amount of patients' incomes, derived mainly from old age pensions, after deductions by the health boards of hospital maintenance charges.  These charges are governed by the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 and 1965 and the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 1976 and 1987.  The charge under the regulations is set out in the 1976 regulations at a rate not exceeding the income of the person, less a sum of £2.50 a week or less such larger sum as may be determined by the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board having regard to the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The amount of the allowance payable to individual patients is determined on the basis of an assessment of needs which is undertaken periodically in respect of each individual patient.</P>

      <P>The provision of services at Wexford General Hospital is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  However, I understand from the board that a reconfiguration of beds at Wexford General Hospital has been undertaken in the context of bed management measures aimed at ensuring that the needs of the people served by the hospital are met within the resources available to the board.</P>
      <P>I understand that the reconfiguration undertaken has involved the conversion, since early September, of St. Catherine's Ward to a day surgical and gynaecological ward.  Under the plan, St. Mary's Ward is to be the in-patient base for gynaecological in-patients.  This reconfiguration is intended by the board to ensure that all of the hospital's beds will be fully utilised and that day surgery will not be compromised by other admissions, thereby ensuring an optimal level of service to the local catchment area.</P>
      <P>Effective bed management forms a normal part of the South-Eastern Health Board's budgetary management strategy and must be set in the context of actual hospital activity for this year.  In the case of Wexford General Hospital, in-patient activity has according to the health board's figures been running at 8.15 per cent above service plan projections for the first eight months of 1998. In addition, the number of overnight hospital beds available does not reflect the complete picture of activity in modern hospitals.</P>
      <P>For example, trends in medical practice in recent years have been for a marked shift in care from in-patient level to day case and out-patient level together with reduced average lengths of stay and increased bed occupancy rates.  To illustrate this point, overall acute hospital in-patient activity for January to June 1998 shows an increase of 1.11 per cent over the same period in 1997, while the corresponding increase in day case activity is 9.78 per cent.</P>

      <P>Under regulations in operation since 1989 all provisional licence holders, with the exception of those who hold: (a) a second provisional licence in respect of category B vehicles (cars); or (b) a provisional licence to drive vehicles in categories A1, A or W (motorcycles or tractors-work vehicles), must be accompanied by a qualified driver while driving.  A qualified driver is a person who holds a full driving licence in respect of the vehicle category being driven.</P>
      <P>The recently published Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 has prioritised action against speeding, alcohol and non-seatbelt wearing as having the greatest and most immediate potential to achieve the gains in road safety targeted by the strategy.  In addition, the new strategy proposes a range of measures designed to improve the formation and training of drivers. These include assisting the Driver Instructor Register towards quality certification; the introduction of a theory test separate from the driving test; the possibility of a new training initiative for motor cyclists and a longer term significant reduction in the number of drivers relying on a provisional licence.</P>

      <P>I have already taken a number of measures which will help to facilitate a high turnout at next year's local elections. With a view to maximising voter turnout I <Col N="541" /> announced earlier this year that the local elections will be held in conjunction with the European elections on Friday, 11 June 1999.  By giving advance notice of the polling day at these elections greater awareness of next year's elections has been generated.  In addition, the Department's publicity campaign, which will take place in November, advising persons to check the draft 1999-2000 register of electors will highlight the fact that this register will be used for next year's European and local elections.  I also intend to publicise the facility of the supplement to the register of electors whereby people can make late applications up to mid-May 1999 to be registered to vote at the June 1999 elections.</P>
      <P>Under electoral law it is the responsibility of the returning officer to select the buildings to be used as polling stations at an election or referendum. In selecting polling stations they endeavour to use buildings which provide reasonable facilities to enable persons to exercise their right to vote.  It would be a matter for individual returning officers to decide whether a shopping centre would be a suitable location as a polling station having regard to all the local circumstances involved.</P>

Section 8 of the Electoral Act, 1992, extends the right to vote at Dáil elections to resident British citizens.  It also provides for extending Dáil franchise to nationals of other EU member states on a reciprocal basis.  The United Kingdom is the only member state which has extended the right to vote at parliamentary elections to resident Irish citizens.  As there have been no approaches by any other member state expressing an interest in having reciprocal voting rights with Ireland, I do not propose to initiate discussions with other member states on the matter.</P>

      <P>The overall trend in repossessions has declined in recent years.  Data published by the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association &mdash; which represents the main lending institutions other than the retail banking sector &mdash; shows the number of repossessions as 215 in 1994, 193 in 1995, 178 in 1996 and 143 in 1997.  These figures include both residential and commercial properties and also properties which have been surrendered voluntarily or abandoned by the borrower.  Accordingly, the number of residential dwellings actually repossessed would have been lower.</P>
      <P>The Irish Bankers Federation, which represents the retail banking sector, have indicated that during the five year period 1990-94 the number of properties repossessed by its member institutions was 18.  It is understood that the federation have not formally compiled statistics on repossessions since 1994 because the information it receives from its members indicates the repossession level has reduced even further since then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety, 1998-2002 sets out ambitious targets for improved <Col N="546" /> road safety performance.  The strategy also sets out key new policies and actions in support of these targets, including the extension of on-the-spot fines to a number of additional road traffic offences and the development of a penalty points system which would trigger disqualification from driving following repeated driving offences.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the regulations necessary for the extension of the on-the-spot fine system is already in hand in my Department with a view to making them shortly.</P>
    <P>The development of a penalty points system is a more complex task.  Its design will need careful consideration in Irish circumstances because of the exclusive constitutional role of the courts in the administration of justice.  New primary legislation will be needed and this will involve examining the scope of the infractions to be covered by the system, as well as the mechanisms whereby thresholds will be triggered for the courts to consider the imposition of a driving disqualification.</P>
    <P>I have no immediate proposals to amend the fines applicable for road traffic offences; some of these have been recently reviewed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 545 and 554 together.</P>
      <P>The Freedom of Information Act, 1997, will apply to local authorities from 21 October this year.  The provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will apply to information where access is not already provided for by other legislation. Therefore, where information concerning planning matters is not already accessible the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will apply to such information.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the planning and development code provides very open access to planning files and registers.  The planning register must be available for inspection during office hours and copies may be taken of any entries in the register on payment of the prescribed fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> Save in the case of a refusal on a planning application, planning application files held by a planning authority must be made readily available for inspection to the general public for five years after the decision has been made.  The planning application and any submissions made in respect of the application must also be available for inspection while the application is being considered by the planning authority.  Internal planning authority reports are not made available for inspection until after the application has been determined.  Where an application has been refused the file must be made available for inspection for one month after the decision. However, planning authorities would generally facilitate access after that period.  My Department has also requested by circular letter that planning authorities should make available to the public copies of documents held on a planning application file &mdash; other than plans, drawings or photographs.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála planning appeal files must also be made available for inspection, and copies may be taken of such files, from the third working day after the board's decision.</P>
    <P>In effect the above access to planning files represents a more ready form of access than is available under the Freedom of Information Act, which envisages a formal written procedure and a one month period for the provision of information. The provisions regarding the availability of documents under the planning code are being considered as part of the current review of planning legislation.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, any person may make a request under the Access to Environmental Information Regulations in respect of information in relation to the environment.  The provisions of these regulations could also be of relevance in the cases of planning matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 547, 562, 564 and 580 together.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change sets a legally binding target for the European Community and its member states to reduce, as a whole, their emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases together &mdash; carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) &mdash; by 8 per cent below 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.  As part of the agreed contribution of member states towards this reduction target, Ireland is committed to limiting the increase in net emissions of the basket of gases to 13 per cent above 1990 levels in the period 2008-2012.</P>
      <P>With a view to identifying and putting in place the necessary policies and measures to ensure that Ireland meets its commitments under the Protocol, I have announced the preparation of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy, to be approved by Government after widespread consultation, to address all gases referred to in the Kyoto Protocol and all relevant sectors of the economy including the agricultural, commercial, energy, industry, residential and transport sectors. As part of the preparation for development of this strategy, a consultancy report on the &ldquo;Limitation and Reduction of CO2 and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland&rdquo; was jointly published last June by my Department and the Department of Public Enterprise.  This examined a broad range of possible policies and measures in all sectors and for all gases.</P>
      <P>Existing policies and measurements put in place to meet commitments under the FCCC are set out in &ldquo;Ireland's Second National Communication&rdquo; under the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Official greenhouse gas inventories, which are compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency in accordance with the guidelines set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate <Col N="550" /> Change and endorsed by the Conference of the Parties to the FCCC, do not disaggregate data to show specific emissions from domestic heating. The inventories indicate that approximately one-quarter of CO2 emissions results directly from fuel consumption in the residential, commercial and institutional sector, when emissions related to electricity generation are compiled separately under the energy and transformation sector. However, the above-mentioned consultancy report estimated that if emissions associated with electricity generation consumed by the residential sector are included with emissions related to fuels directly used in the residential sector, then emissions from this sector would correspond to 30 per cent of national CO2 emissions.  There are insufficient data to suggest that this level of emissions results solely from domestic heating arrangements as emissions associated, for example, with the use of appliances such as refrigeration, lighting, hot water, and cooking are also included.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the Building Regulations in 1992, energy use in new buildings has been reduced by an estimated 20 per cent, resulting in a 2 per cent reduction of CO2 emissions by the year 2000.  In December 1997, I launched a revised and upgraded building control package which included a set of 12 revised technical guidance documents.  This revised package will result in an energy saving in space heating estimated at up to 10 per cent.  Work has also commenced in my Department on the next review of Part L &mdash; Conservation of Fuel and Energy to take account of Ireland's obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.  The above-mentioned consultancy report also specifically identifies a number of possible policies and measures in the residential sector for consideration in the context of the development of the national strategy referred to above.</P>
    <P>The <i>National Roads Needs Study</i>, published by the National Roads Authority last July, is a detailed assessment of the current condition of the national road network and of the work which remains to be done to complete the network.  The study recognises that, in developing the network, full account will have to be taken of environmental sustainability.  The study on the <i>Limitation and Reduction of CO2 and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Ireland</i> recognises the economic importance of an improved national road network and analyses a number of specific measures towards the minimisation of the long-term trend towards increased emissions of greenhouse gas from the transport sector.  Elaboration of the national strategy will involve appropriate actions in the transport sector as well as all other relevant sectors.</P>
    <P>Copies of the consultancy studies and the Second National Communication referred to are available in the Library.</P>

      <P>My Department estimates that about 1 million of the current housing stock of 1.2 million dwellings were built prior to 1 June 1992 when the Building Regulations, 1991, came into operation.</P>
      <P>Last December, I published revised technical guidance on the consolidated Building Regulations, 1997.  The revised technical guidance provides for voluntary energy rating of new houses. Energy rating calculations will be faciliated by a software package developed for the design professions by UCD, on a consultancy basis for the Irish Energy Centre.</P>
      <P>My hope would be that developers would highlight the energy rating in marketing new houses; and that house purchasers would take these ratings into account when selecting the house of their choice.  I have publicly signalled that I intend to consider making energy rating of new houses mandatory, within the next five years, in the light of practical experience with the voluntary system.</P>
      <P>The poor energy conservation standards of existing buildings, including houses, is a major problem throughout the EU and one for which there is no easy solution.  It is primarily for the owners of buildings to commission energy audits of their property; and to take remedial action in the light of the results.  In April 1996, my Department requested local authorities to give greater priority to the need to improve energy efficiency in their existing stock of about 100,000 rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>Ireland must limit the increase in greenhouse gas emissions to 13 per cent above 1990 levels by the period 2008-2012 in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.  As part of the development of a national greenhouse gas abatement strategy, a consultancy report examining possible policies and measures was jointly published by the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Public Enterprise and a public consultation process launched.  This report examined a range of policies and measures in, <i>inter alia</i>, the residential sector &mdash; including policies that could be applied to the existing housing stock to improve energy conservation.  These measures will be considered as part of the consultative process in the elaboration of the national strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 549, 560 and 589 together.</P>
      <P>Growth in transport demand in recent years, which has been closely following economic performance, presents an obvious challenge for sustainable development in Ireland.  Policy responses must be based on an integrated approach to transport requirements, including increased investment in road infrastructure but also improvements in public transport, management of road transport demand, promotion of alternative transport modes, better co-ordination of transport and land use planning, and improved traffic management.  These matters and the environmental impacts of transport are being addressed through the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 and Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland; in urban transport initiatives such as the DTI; and in the planning work under way in Departments and agencies for the transport elements of the National Development Plan for the period 2000-06.  This integrated approach will be increasingly relevant to transport policy in the years ahead and will be fully reflected in the transport investment programme to be drawn up following completion of the NDP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the mid-term review of the current Community Support Framework, it was agreed at the request of the European Commission that a study of road pricing and related issues, with reference to practice across the EU, would be carried out.

In the meantime, the National Roads Authority has made a tolling scheme designed to <Col N="553" /> facilitate traffic management of the purposed Dublin Port Tunnel.  This will be submitted for my determination following completion of the public consultative process which has now commenced.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Midleton initiative.  I welcome any initiative which is aimed at improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  Many local authorities are improving the accessibility of their areas and my Department regularly reminds local authorities of the need for more action both in relation to access generally and in relation to access to their own buildings and facilities.</P>
      <P>My Department has taken many measures to improve levels of accessibility for people with disabilities. My reply to Question No. 203 of 3 June 1998, outlines the measures the Departartment has enacted in recent years relating to people with disabilities.  Other measures taken include furnishing advice to local authorities on the dishing of footpaths which, on national roads, is financed by the National Roads Authority, and, on non-national roads, is part-financed by my Department, a review of the public library service to examine all aspects of this service including services to people with disabilities and, most recently, the issuing of a draft code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the local authority service on which comments have been invited.  It is also my intention to amend &ldquo;Technical Guidance Document M &mdash; Access for Disabled Persons&rdquo;&mdash; associated with the Building Regulations, 1997, to require all new houses being built on or after 1 January 2000, to be accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, under a wide-ranging review of the Tidy Towns Competition, now administered by my Department, criteria relating to accessibility were incorporated in the marking scheme for judging the competition; a special inclusive environment access award, sponsored by the National Rehabilitation Board and the Irish Wheelchair Association, is also given each year to the town or village which makes the best contribution to improving facilities for people with disabilities.</P>

It establishes the specific target of reducing by at least 20 per cent the number of fatal road accidents &mdash; commonly drink-related &mdash; occurring during the hours of darkness; and it undertakes, or proposes for further consideration, a number of new counter-measures. These include the introduction and extension countrywide, beginning in 1999, of evidential breath testing; possible selective application of random breath testing; and possible wider availability of information from coroner's reports about the blood alcohol level of road accident victims.  These and the many other policies and actions co-ordinated by the strategy will be progressed urgently with a view to attaining the improved road safety performance targeted by the strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 557 and 558 together.</P>
      <P>The report in question presents the results of a second assessment by the European Environment Agency of the state of the environment at a pan-European level.  It includes an overall summary assessment of progress over the period 1990-95 in respect of 12 key European environmental problems evaluated in the report, by reference to policy developments and the overall state of the environment.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns, on a European level, which arise from the second assessment. However, the report does not set out systematically to compare or evaluate the performance of individual European countries in relation to environmental protection, and it would not be meaningful to attempt any such comparison based on its findings.</P>
      <P>In the case of Ireland, the most recent state of the environment report, prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1996, supported the view that Ireland continues to enjoy a relatively unspoilt environment, but with increasing pressures associated with economic development. A further state of the environment report is now being prepared by the agency.  I am confident that Government policy, building on the analysis contained in Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, is providing a framework within which necessary growth can be maintained in an environmentally sustainable manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Sofia Protocol ratified in 1994, Ireland was required to stabilise NOx emissions at their 1987 level, estimated to be 105,400 tonnes per annumn, by the end of 1994.  The latest national emission figure was 114,420 tonnes for 1996.</P>
      <P>Transport is the largest source of NOx, with vehicles accounting for over 40 per cent of national emissions.  The power generation sector is the other major source but emissions in that sector are being addressed by the introduction at all major generating stations of low NOx producing burners, and emissions have fallen over 5,000 tonnes between 1994 and 1997 from large combustion plants due mainly to the installation of NOx abatement technology in power stations.</P>
      <P>The challenge to date in meeting Sofia Protocol requirements is significantly attributable to transport growth in recent years.  However, successively more stringent vehicle emission controls, notably the fitting of catalytic converters, are expected to bring about significant NOx reductions over time.  Ireland supports the further tightening of vehicle emission controls agreed in June 1998 under the auto oil programme.  These cleaner fuels required under the programme, together with local traffic management strategies for major urban areas, increasing emphasis on public transport and alternatives to private car use will also facilitate controls on NOx emissions from vehicles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government responded quickly and decisively to the Bacon report on house prices with a comprehensive package of measures announced in its Action on House Prices published on 23 April last.  The package involves a three pronged approach to increase the potential supply of housing, address factors causing overheating or distortions in the market, and improve the position of prospective first time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures to assist first-time buyers form a key element of the package including an increase in the income limits for the local authority shared ownership scheme; removal of fiscal incentives to investors who were pricing low income buyers out of the market; significant reductions in stamp duty rates, particularly at lower price levels; measures to boost housing supply such as special Exchequer funding of £35 million for water, sewerage and roads infrastructure to open up substantial extra land for housing, promotion of <Col N="559" /> increased densities at appropriate locations, and a temporary reduction of capital gains tax on disposal of serviced land to encourage faster release for residential development.</P>
    <P>The full effect of many of the measures, particularly those designed to promote housing supply, will only be seen in the medium term.  However, positive effects have already been reported by market sources, including signs of some easing of the house prices situation, first-time buyers reclaiming the starter home market, which had been increasingly dominated by investors, and increase in the number of second hand houses coming on the market as a result of stamp duty reductions.  Housing output in 1998 is set to exceed last year's record level and this trend should be reinforced significantly as the measures taken by the Government to boost housing supply begin to be reflected in terms of output.  Certain of these measures, for example, those to reduce investor demand and secure higher densities in residential developments have particular relevance and impact in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>: From the introduction of the rental subsidy scheme in May 1991, there was no provision for the purchase of individual houses by tenants. This position was reviewed again prior to the publication of Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead in 1995 when it was found that a tenant purchase scheme for rental subsidy houses would not be feasible as the sale of individual houses would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and to continue to provide further housing projects.</P>
      <P>As previously indicated, residents of rental subsidy houses of more than one year's duration may, on surrendering houses to the approved body, qualify for the following benefits available to local authority tenants surrendering houses to the authority: special mortgage allowance of £4,500 over five years to assist with mortgage repayments; the shared ownership system without having to satisfy the income elegibility criteria; improvement works-in-lieu; affordable housing sites; and exemption from the income limit for local authority housing loans.</P>
      <P>Full details of these options are available from the local authorities who are responsible for administering the rental subsidy scheme in their areas.</P>

      <P>The rent payable to the voluntary housing body under the terms of the rental subsidy scheme is income related and standard throughout the country.  The scheme was reviewed last November when reductions were made in the rent payable on both household and subsidiary income and a maximum was introduced to the rent payable in respect of subsidiary income.  As local authorities are responsible for the determination of the rents of their own dwellings, rents payable by their tenants may vary depending on the local authority area in which the house is located.</P>

      <P>The DTO Transportation Review and Short-Term Action Plan has now been published and the Government has already endorsed the early implementation of most of its proposed measures, for which moreover substantial funding totalling some £145 million has been provided.  Measures requiring the provision of additional funding <i>viz.</i> proposals relating to the purchase of 100 additional buses, additional subventions to support enhanced bus and rail services, and the provision of additional resources for the Garda traffic division will be considered by the Government in the context of the 1999 Estimates and budget.</P>
      <P>The short-term action plan is designed to accelerate the implementation of those elements of the DTI strategy that can be completed in the period up to 2000.  It focuses therefore on public transport enhancement, traffic management, parking policy and the provision of cycling facilities.  In addition to the measures proposed in the plan work is continuing on progressing the major infrastructural projects provided for in the DTI strategy, including the completion of the remaining elements of the Dublin C-ring and LUAS.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 577, 578 and 579 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new house grant is payable only where a house meets the conditions and the standards specified by my Department and set out in the explanatory memorandum on new house grants supplied to each applicant for a grant.  In particular, construction of the house must be in compliance <Col N="563" /> with the requirements of the Building Regulations.  The suitability of new materials, products or components must be demonstrated through certification by a competent body, such as the National Standards Authority of Ireland/Irish Agrement Board.  In the case of this particular product, the certification required is not available in respect of the use of the product for hot water or central heating systems.  As a consequence, 44 applications for new house grants have not been paid to date and the applicants have been notified accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Irish distributor of this building material has made a formal complaint to the EU Commission, alleging breaches of the Treaty of Rome, against the Department.</P>
    <P>The distributor of this product has also initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court over the refusal of the NSAI-IAB to issue an agreement certificate of approval for this product for hot water-central heating purposes and the consequent refusal of my Department to pay grants for new houses incorporating the product where it has been used for such purposes.  The High Court proceedings are against the NSAI, the Minister, Ireland and the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>An EU Commission official had a meeting with officials of my Department on 14 September 1998 to discuss EU Commission proposals to improve the Competitiveness of the Construction Industry and the EU Construction Products Directive (89/106/EEC).  The relevant complaint and judicial review proceedings were not on the formal agenda.  However, the EU Commission official informally adverted to the complaint at the outset of the meeting.  It was explained that the details of the complaint could not be discussed because of the danger of prejudicing the judicial review proceedings in this jurisdiction. However, the officials of my Department offered to supply the EU Commission official with a copy of the Statement of Opposition by the State to the judicial review application lodged with the High Court.  The EU Commission official accepted a copy of the legal document involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002 proposes a comprehensive and coordinated set of policies and measures designed to reduce both road fatalities and serious injuries by a minimum of 20 per cent by 2002.  This strategy prioritises improvements in the key areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing, but also emphasises the importance of education and other instruments for improving road safety.</P>
      <P>The strategy recognises the vital importance of children learning good road safety habits from the earliest possible age and underlines the role of parents in this process.  Educational measures proposed include the development of a teachers' resource pack on road, fire and water safety by the National Safety Council.  This will form part of the social, personal, health and education programme of the new primary school curriculum. The pack will be distributed to all 3,300 primary schools.</P>
      <P>Second level schools have traditionally received less attention in terms of road safety education.  There is therefore ground to be made up in developing the skills of secondary school children as the adult road users for the future. The National Safety Council will develop special material/programmes for the post-primary sector. This will focus both on safe road use by teenagers and the future responsibilities of young people as drivers.</P>

      <P>The maintenance-improvement of non-national roads in its area is a matter for Skibbereen Urban District Council, to be funded from its own resources, supplemented by State grants.  Skibbereen UDC was allocated a grant of £50,000 in 1998, an increase of 14 per cent on 1997.

The improvements which are being assisted under the sub-programme are designed to promote sustainable physical, social and economic revitalisation of centres ranging from the smaller villages to the larger cities.

      <P>The period of two years allows a successful driving test applicant, if he or she wishes, fully to use up the period of their provisional licence.

      <P>Persons participating in a vocational training opportunities scheme, back to education allowance schemes or the part-time education initiative scheme may continue to receive their full weekly payment and retain any secondary benefits, such as rent supplement under the SWA scheme, which they may have been receiving prior to participating on one of these schemes.</P>
      <P>Vocational training opportunities scheme conditions were brought into line with those payable under the back to education schemes with effect from June 1998.  Participants receive the equivalent of the maximum standard rate of unemployment benefit.  They are also now paid for the full duration of their course including holiday periods.  While earnings from part-time employment or summer holiday work do not affect the basic rate in payment, they are assessable for rent supplement purposes.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to a supplement is determined by the health boards.  Supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less £6.  This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, applicants are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate SWA rate.</P>
      <P>At current SWA rates the basic needs of an adult is taken to be £68.40 weekly.  Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease in the rent supplement rate payable.</P>

      <P>The scheme of grants to <Col N="572" /> voluntary organisations providing marriage and child counselling is designed to support the provision of voluntary marriage counselling services throughout the country, to ensure that they are available and accessible to the public and to support the provision of counselling for children whose parents have separated.</P>
      <P>This year £1.5 million has been allocated to support the provision of services &mdash; an increase of £600,000 on 1997.  To date, over 150 voluntary organisations have received grant aid amounting to £1.27 million.  Of this amount some £643,500 was approved for ACCORD centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The following criteria are taken into consideration in allocating grants to voluntary organisations: (i) the service which is being provided must be marriage counselling and/or child counselling in relation to parental separation; (ii) the quality of service, this includes management and back-up support for the service and qualifications and training of counsellors; (iii) the demand for the service, that is the number of clients using the service in a particular area.  Having regard to these criteria, a grant of £8,000 was approved for ACCORD, Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>I have recently announced the availability of further grants to organisations providing marriage preparation courses and to organisations providing bereavement counselling and support on the death of a family member.</P>

      <P>The use of electronic information and communications technology is widespread throughout Departments and is now universally employed in the delivery of services. Greater co-ordination between State agencies through sharing of information can lead to more convenient access to services, higher quality services and more effective use of resources and a level of information-sharing has existed for many years.  For example in the administration of social welfare schemes my Department receives information from the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the payment of social insurance contributions by employers and employees.  Similarly the Department makes information available to other agencies such as health boards and FÁS. <Col N="573" /> In recognition of the need to extend these arrangements to the wider public service I introduced enabling legislation in the 1998 Social Welfare Act to promote greater sharing of information. I have also established at official level an interdepartmental group to oversee the development of appropriate systems and to co-ordinate the sharing of information where possible.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for a common public service identifier &mdash; the personal public service number, the associated public service card and sharing of personal information between Departments and agencies.  Implementation of the personal public service number is essential to increasing information sharing among public bodies. Enhancements to the relevant computer systems in the various bodies are also required to enable them to use the PPSN.  At present such sharing is possible by a relatively small number of bodies who previously used the old revenue and social insurance number.  This capacity will be extended to other bodies as resources and opportunities permit.</P>
      <P>The law also provides considerable protection for the citizen by restricting the use of the PPSN to specified bodies and only for specified transactions and restricting the use of shared information to the administration of specified schemes.</P>

      <P>Currently a local authority tenant can arrange to pay rent by means of direct deduction from certain social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>This deduction arrangement &mdash; known as the household budgeting scheme &mdash; is available to unemployed persons paid by means of the post-draft system at Post Offices, to one parent families, to invalidity pensioners and to people in receipt of disability allowance.  The latter two categories were included in the household budgeting scheme from August 1998.  The household budgeting scheme is working well and there are 71 local authorities using the scheme at present with over £254,200 collected each week through the scheme.  The numbers availing of the scheme have grown by about 20 per cent since August 1997 and currently stand at 14,066.</P>
      <P>It is intended to extend the scheme to most other social welfare payments but this is dependent on computer developments on existing payment schemes which cannot be carried out until essential work to ensure year 2000 compliance is completed on all computer systems within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997 amended the Social Welfare code by providing regulatory powers to deduct an amount, not exceeding the weekly rent, from the person's social welfare payments, without his or her consent, where that person has accumulated arrears of rent with the local authority.  In view of the developments which have taken place and are <Col N="575" /> planned under the existing arrangements, I do not propose to make regulations under the Act at this time.  However, I will be keeping this matter under review and will consult with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, as to whether and when such regulations should be made.</P>

      <P>Rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that the person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the supplementary welfare allowance rate less £6.</P>
      <P>This £6 represents the minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  In addition to the minimum contribution, recipients are required to contribute any assessable means in excess of the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate.</P>
      <P>The current SWA rate for an adult is £68.40 per week.  Any increase in income over and above that rate will result in a decrease of that amount in the rent supplement rate payable.  As the current unemployment assistance and third level allowance rate is £70.50 per week, the personal contribution is increased by £2.10 to £8.10 weekly.</P>
      <P>In the particular case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned had been receiving an incorrect rate of rent supplement up to the end of July last because of an error in the original calculation made by the health board.  As a result, a minimum contribution of £6 was assessed instead of £8.10. The position was subsequently rectified.</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will examine the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 8, and other similar cases, who has nine stamped contributions on average but who falls below the required ten contributions to quality for a pro rata pension; the reason ten contributions is treated as the cut-off point; the reason those without this level of contributions, as highlighted in this case, receive no pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The rate of an old age contributory pension payable to any person is related to the average of full-rate contributions, paid or credited over their lifetime of insurable employment.  To qualify, a person must: have <Col N="576" /> entered insurance before age 56; have the equivalent of at least 156 weeks' paid contributions; and have a minimum yearly average of 20 contributions paid or credited since 1953 or the time they entered insurable employment.</P>
      <P>As a minimum qualifying condition, a person is required to have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961. Applying to all insured people, its purpose is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements have been made in recent years in recognition of the difficulties faced by people whose yearly average of contributions is diluted due to gaps in their insurance records.  For instance, as in the case of the person concerned, where there are insufficient contributions to achieve a yearly average of 20, provision has been made for a reduction in the yearly average to ten to 19 contributions which would entitle a person to a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  A minimum yearly average of ten is considered to be a reasonable level of contributions.</P>
      <P>The person concerned unsuccessfully applied for an old age contributory pension in the normal course in February 1988.  His yearly average of eight contributions was insufficient for this pension under the then prevailing conditions.</P>
      <P>In November 1991, a &lsquo;mixed-insurance&rsquo;<i>pro rata</i> pension was introduced which enabled those with a mixture of full and modified rate insurance contributions to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension for averages of less than 20 full rate contributions. The rate payable is in proportion to the periods of insurance completed at the rate appropriate for old-age retirement pensions.  In addition, those qualifying for this pension also became entitled to ancillary benefits such as the free schemes, which would not, otherwise, have been available to them.  In the case of the person concerned, he was awarded this pension with effect from 29 November 1991, now payable at the current weekly rate of £32.50, including a qualified adult allowance in respect of his wife.</P>
      <P>The new <i>pro rata</i> pension which was introduced in November 1997 extended entitlement to those whose yearly average, based on full rate contributions, ranged from ten to 19.  As the Deputy will be aware, a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions gives a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between 10 and 14 results in a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum.  The person concerned does not qualify for this pension as his yearly average, based on his full rate contributions, remains unchanged at eight.</P>

      <P>The average processing time for appeals which are determined following an oral hearing is at present 30 weeks.  The average waiting time for such appeals in 1997 was 32 weeks.</P>
      <P>In some cases appeals can be dealt with on the basis of the particulars supplied by the appellant and by the deciding officer, without the need for an oral hearing, and these are cleared more quickly.  The average time for appeals summarily dealt with in August 1998 was just under 13 weeks.  When an oral hearing is required, however, additional delay is unavoidable.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals system is quasi-judicial and the procedures are designed to ensure that every appellant's case receives full and adequate consideration.  There is an inevitable time-lag in such a process.  In some cases delay may be due to material from the appellant being awaited by the appeals officer before a decision can be made.  Delay can also occur when the grounds advanced by the appellant in support of the appeal require further investigation or, in sickness related cases, where arrangements are made for a further examination by a medical assessor.  Oral hearings arranged by the appeals office may also have to be postponed at the request of the appellant or his/her legal representatives, because of other commitments by them or because more time is sought by them in order to prepare their case.</P>
      <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the social welfare appeals office.  At all times, however, it is necessary to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is fully consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that the appeal of every person who has recourse to the office is fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 609 and 636 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> The 1998 budget provided for an increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment for some 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for a further 54,000 pensioners on reduced rate contributory pensions. This represented an increase ranging between 6.4 and 7.4 per cent.  All other social welfare recipients received a general increase of £3, representing increases of between 4.2 and 4.6 per cent.  In addition, the qualified adult allowance was increased by 3 per cent in general, giving actual increases of between £1.20 and £1.50.</P>
    <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including increases for old age pensioners, widows, widowers and qualified adults, is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government Programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

      <P>Under the family and community services resource centre programme operated by my Department, funding is provided for local resource centres which aim to combat disadvantage by improving the functioning of the family unit.</P>
      <P>Local centres are funded under this programme to undertake a wide range of activities designed to improve the functioning of the family unit, that is by providing special services for lone parent families, young mothers and others considered in need of extra support and can act as a first step to community participation and social inclusion for the most vulnerable and marginalised families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These centres may also be concerned with initiatives to enhance the role of young fathers in the lives of their children and to enhance their parenting skills and initiatives to promote the greater involvement of young men in the life of the community.  Activities provided by these <Col N="579" /> centres are aimed at enhancing the self-esteem and potential of individuals in order to increase the capacity of local communities to become self-reliant and self-directed.  Programmes are based on the principles of personal development, adult education and community empowerment.</P>
    <P>The focus of this programme is on assisting adults in developing the capacity to participate fully in their communities, and on doing this through the provision of a supportive structure, that is family resource centres.  Many of the adults assisted through these centres participate in adult education classes and activities that contribute overall to their personal development and which may, indirectly, contribute to an improvement in their family circumstances.</P>
    <P>My Department received an application from the group indicated in the Deputy's question. This application was considered in relation to the criteria applying to the programme.  While the group's proposal included some initiatives aimed at providing supports and training opportunties for parents the main focus of the group's activity is the provision of programmes aimed specifically at children in the 0-5 year age group including a visitation programme where parents are offered individual advice on parenting issues, again to deal with mainly pre-school children.  The direct child-centred focus of the group, as indicated by the Deputy, is not within the remit of my Department's programme and would be more appropriate to the health board.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department also received an application from a second group in Sligo who were also seeking inclusion in the programme and a third project based in the same area has secured funding from the health board for a pilot initiative for children at risk.  I understand that the intention is that the health board project will also provide broader family supports that would be appropriate to my Department's programme.  For all these reasons &mdash; and to minimise duplication of funding between State agencies &mdash; it is not considered appropriate to offer funding in this case.</P>

      <P>This person concerned was in receipt of a one-parent family payment &mdash; formerly lone parent's allowance &mdash; for some <Col N="580" /> years.  Following investigations by a local officer of the Department, it was decided that she was no longer entitled to the allowance with effect from 29 January 1998 as she was co-habiting with another person as husband and wife.</P>
      <P>The person concerned appealed this decision. An appeals officer, after two oral hearings on the matter on 14 May and 23 July 1998, decided that she was disqualified from receiving a one-parent family payment as she and another person were co-habiting as husband and wife.  Her landlord attended the first appeals hearing but declined to attend the second.  It was a matter for the appeals officer to decide whether the landlord's evidence was relevant and whether he should be summoned to attend the hearing or not.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer's decision on the claim is final and conclusive, and can only be reviewed in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.  No such new facts or evidence have been submitted to my Department since the appeals officer's decision.</P>
      <P>Cohabitation exists where two persons are living together as husband and wife.  The concept of part-time cohabitation does not exist in social welfare law.  The criteria for assessing cohabitation include whether the couple reside in and constitute a single household, the stability of this relationship and the social and sexual nature of the relationship.  There is no single factor by which the existence of a cohabitation can be established and in the final analysis, the deciding officer or appeals officer must form a judgment on whether the circumstances of a case are sufficiently similar to those of a married couple to establish that the client concerned and another person are cohabiting as husband and wife.</P>

    <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment benefit since 31 August 1998.  He is being paid at a weekly rate of £111.70 &mdash; that is £70.50 maximum personal rate plus £41.20 full adult dependant allowance. <Col N="581" /> Increases are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment child dependant allowances are payable if the children are in full-time education up to the age of 22 years.  Such increases are not payable with short-term benefits including disability benefit, occupational injury benefit and unemployment benefit unless a person has been in receipt of unemployment benefit for not less than 390 days.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention, and whose incomes fall below certain limits.

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are on long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week &mdash; £8 per week in smokeless zones &mdash; is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the national fuel scheme has increased by approximately 20 per cent in the last five years from £37.5 million in 1993 to £45 million in 1997.  This year a sum of £45.2 million has been provided in the Estimates for the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that increasing the basic allowance by £1 per week would cost £7.6 million.  Any increase in the rate of payment would have significant cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context, taking increases in primary weekly payment rates into account.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of the back to work allowance scheme that an applicant must apply prior to taking up employment.  The person concerned commenced employment on 25 May 1998.  She did not apply for the allowance until 8 July 1998.  Her application was refused on the grounds that her claim was late and that she was in a position to return to the workforce without the need for the financial support which the scheme provides.</P>
