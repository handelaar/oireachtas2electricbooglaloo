      <P>The Interdepartmental Strategy Group on Employment and Unemployment meets on average every six to eight weeks and has <Col N="1195" /> met on 30 occasions since its inception in October 1995.  The most recent meeting took place on 15 September and this was followed by a meeting with the social partners on 23 October to discuss labour market policy in the context of the forthcoming budget.  These and other issues were explored further at the Partnership 2000 plenary meeting on 28 October.  The next meeting will take place on Thursday this week.</P>
      <P>The group is currently examining the operation of active labour market policies in the light of changing labour market conditions and the aims and strategies set out in the national employment action plan.  This examination will also take into account the various reviews of labour market intervention measures either completed, under way or planned.  It is envisaged that this work will determine the agenda for future meetings of the group, both for the remainder of this year and the early months of next year.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe full employment is an attainable objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on the meaning of full employment in terms of the live register. Given the make up of the live register I do not believe everyone will obtain employment.  We are close to a position where people on the live register seeking employment, who take up training opportunities, will obtain work but maybe not in the area of their choice.  In many areas, not only in areas of skill shortages, there is meaningful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's estimate of the number of people on the live register of unemployed who, in practice, are not employable in full-time employment?  Will he agree there are many unemployed people who would be able to take up part-time employment, but not necessarily full-time employment, and that we need to work with employers to ensure part-time employment is made available to ensure we get as near as possible to having fully employed everyone who is currently unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with that statement.  The most recent figure I have seen for part-time employed ranged from 22,000 upwards, some of whom work two days while others work three days per week.  There is further scope in that area.  That figure has grown throughout the 1990s.  The employment action plan is geared towards helping people on the live register.  It will assist them to seek training which, in turn, will assist them in obtaining employment.  There are many industries which could benefit.  More and more employers, not only in catering, leisure and tourism but in other industries, say that they could take on employees with a small amount of training.  Although I have often sought it, I do not have the number on the live register who wish to take up work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the decision in the Estimates to cut back the provision for community employment, has the strategy group assessed the likely impact both on the capacity to take people off the live register, given that this is a successful scheme with 40 per cent placement, and on the education sector where up to 6,000 people on community employment are providing services in education?  These resources do not appear to be covered elsewhere in the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The cutback in the community employment scheme is quite low.  The committee, which has a co-ordinating role, and other studies have shown it should use the resources &mdash; this is the principle underlying the Estimate &mdash; for training, particularly in the social exclusion area. The Deputy is correct in saying that community employment is of benefit but the whole idea is to obtain sustainable full-time employment for these people.  The unemployment figure is still enormous compared to what it was at the beginning at the decade.  In 1993 as Minister for Finance I was responsible for making resources available to increase community employment dramatically which we did but we have not succeeded in reducing it even though the unemployment levels have changed from 16.5 per cent at that time to less than 9 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those schemes will hold.  The Deputy is aware community employment schemes have been collapsing in many areas, including my own, because of a lack of people. This is happening in other parts of the country also.  The cutback in community employment is quite small and I do not see it impinging on those involved in meaningful community employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is much work being done by this group to encourage the principle of profit sharing and share options in view of the alarming increase in the rate of wages and salaries, which is well beyond the rate of inflation and could cause difficulties in the economy in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is being done but not by this group as it is concerned with labour market initiatives.  The tax strategy group and other groups have been involved in share option schemes.  This group is endeavouring to find ways to reflect what is happening in the labour market, to get as close as possible to full employment and to train those who are unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the group dealing with employment and unemployment, it should also look at the area of employment retention.  Does the Taoiseach believe the group's remit should be <Col N="1197" /> extended to look at other areas, such as remuneration for those in employment or those who could come into employment if the conditions were enticing enough?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the group discusses these issues but they are not within its remit.  This group deals with the national employment action plan, Partnership 2000, the NAP scheme and other labour market areas.  The issue mentioned by the Deputy is being discussed by the tax strategy group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach support in principle the encouragement of part-time employment for people who want to avail of it? Is he aware that Departments, including the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, are frustrating requests by full-time employees of Departments to get job sharing arrangements, which would open up labour market opportunities for other people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the example cited by the Deputy but I am in favour of part-time employment.  Approximately 25,000 people work on a part-time basis, although there is huge movement in and out of that category.  I support part-time work because it is a reality of the labour market in 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's support. Will he ask the interdepartmental strategy group to look specifically at outstanding requests from civil servants for job sharing both at national and local level and, where possible, to give sympathetic support?  My understanding from constituency queries is that this is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the target of full employment will not be achieved because of the Government's policy of excluding large parts of the country, such as the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and other Border areas, from job creation?  Not one industry has been announced for that region since this Administration took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Some 2,000 jobs were recently announced by Xerox which will be of great benefit to the Border region.  Some of the key characteristics of the labour market performance can be seen from the labour force survey which shows that unemployment, which was 17 per cent, is now down to 9 per cent.  The national employment action plan sets a target of 7 per cent, which is low by EU standards.  The reduction has been achieved despite the most rapid growth in the labour force ever experienced in the State.  There was an average annual increase of 32,000 people joining the labour force between 1992 and 1997 compared with an equivalent figure of 6,000 in the period from 1982 to 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1198" /> The number of people in the labour force increased by 203,000 or 15 per cent during the decade to April 1997.  The underlying increase in the number of people in the labour force in the subsequent six months was 30,000 to 40,000.  In other words, the number in the labour force increased by 203,000 in a decade and by 13 or 15 per cent of that figure in the subsequent period. There has been a more rapid decrease in the number of long-term unemployed than in the overall number unemployed in the past four years.  Approximately 9 per cent of the labour force were long-term unemployed four years ago, but that figure has fallen to 5.6 per cent and the best guestimate for this year is below 5 per cent. In absolute terms total unemployment has fallen by 52,000 in the past three to four years of which 42,000 represents a decrease in the number of long-term unemployed.  That is the position across all regions of the country.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that just under two thirds of the 54,000 decrease in numbers on the live register over the past two years can be attributed to a decrease in the number of long-term unemployed. In the 12 months to April this year, more than 92 per cent, representing almost 20,000 people, of the estimated fall in unemployment was accounted for by the long-term unemployed, representing a 15.5 per cent decrease.  Those figures show there has been a fall in the number of long-term unemployed and youth unemployment.</P>

Do they agree with its blatant effort to force workers to take up the lowest paid jobs, which employers may have some difficulty filling because of the virtual starvation scale wages being offered, or do they agree that community employment schemes are crucial to many community facilities?  Do they agree the direction in this regard should be one that encourages workers to participate in those schemes under proper working conditions and with proper wages rather than one where employers seek to marginalise communities and cause further problems such as they are now attempting to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question was whether I agree with the employers federation that the number participating in these schemes should be dramatically reduced.  The figure of 11,000 or 12,000 was mentioned.  I do not agree with that.  It would not be wise to reduce the number in those schemes by either of those figures because that would result in what Deputy Bruton spoke about earlier.  It would cut into areas where there are only social jobs.  There is an argument for reducing the number to some extent because companies throughout the country are offering sustainable and fairly well remunerated jobs. Employers are seeking to recruit workers, although not those who are participating in community employment schemes.  Those participating in community employment schemes get a basic level of training after which they can move to take up sustainable jobs.  To cut the number participating in those schemes by the 30 per cent, as suggested, would decimate the community structures that have been built up, whether in education, the leisure industry, cre ches and other community activities, and I would not agree to such a cut.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there is a disincentive for a person living in an inner city flat complex, who must pay rent on his or her gross income which is also used to calculate his or her eligibility for a medical card even though that person's income is much lower after tax is deducted, to take up a job compared, perhaps, to his or her neighbour?  More than 200,000 people remain on the live register because of such inbuilt poverty traps.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a well known Dublin restaurant group is recruiting staff from continental Europe because people in Ireland will not take up jobs as a result of those poverty traps?  Will he ensure that resolution of this issue forms part of the central strategy to deal with the unemployment problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a number of these difficulties and I assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to address them. Under certain schemes, people are entitled to retain secondary benefits and, therefore, I cannot accept that the issue to which the Deputy referred is the sole reason that people will not take up employment.  There are many jobs which offer remuneration that is well above what could be classified as a &ldquo;minimum wage&rdquo; and employers find it difficult to encourage people to take them up, even when they can retain their secondary benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that <Col N="1200" /> there is a 50 per cent unemployment rate among refugees living in and entitled to work in Ireland? One of the reasons for this is that they are paid rent subsidy which they will lose on taking up employment.  These people are available to work but are prevented from doing so by the sort of poverty trap to which Deputy Gay Mitchell referred.  Will the Taoiseach investigate this matter not only from the perspective of refugees but also from that of Irish people who cannot take up employment because they may lose their entitlement to rent subsidy?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At my request, the IFSC Clearing House Group is preparing a strategy for the development of the international financial services industry in Ireland, building on the success of the IFSC.  This strategy will primarily focus on the need to maximise the level of sustainable economic activity and employment in international financial services in Ireland, building upon the existing activity in the IFSC.  This should encompass not only the number of jobs, but also the quality of employment and activity, and the possibility of enhancing sustainability through links to related sectors such as shared services and electronic commerce.  The strategy will outline a clear vision for the Government to adopt and implement.</P>
      <P>The strategy will address issues concerning: the future location of the industry and the provision of infrastructure for the continued growth of the IFSC; the future marketing and promotion of the sector; how to ensure a continued supply of skilled employees for IFSC companies; the need for a tax regime supportive of competitiveness, while recognising EU and domestic constraints; measures to enhance the competitiveness of the centre through company law legislation; the need to maintain the existing high standard of regulation of the industry; the implications of the introduction of the euro; new business opportunities based around the existing level of financial services activity in the centre; and the structures necessary to implement the strategy.  There have been recent discussions at international and EU level on the international community's response to the crisis in financial markets.  The Government has participated in these discussions and the crisis remains a matter of serious concern to Ireland given the open nature of our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impact of recent turbulence on world financial <Col N="1201" /> markets will also be taken into account in the strategy being prepared by the IFSC Clearing House Group.  This strategy will recognise the need for a flexible response to emerging international problems.  The centre is still highly competitive and has limited exposure to the countries most affected.  In my view, the most effective response to these events is to enhance the already strong competitive position of the IFSC and that will be a key objective of the strategy.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach think there would be value in implementing some international standards of supervision of highly levered hedge funds in view of the destructive role that some of these funds have played in putting short-term finance into certain currencies and then withdrawing it overnight in a way which makes any form of coherent exchange rate policy by developing countries virtually impossible? Does he agree that all players in a market should recognise that the market only exists because of a social consensus to allow the market to function and that people should not abuse that market power in a way which can bring countries to their knees, as we have seen as a result of the activities of some hedge funds recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  The operation of the hedge fund system in the past decade has resulted in enormous economic damage on at <Col N="1204" /> least three occasions in different parts of the world.  I attended a number of meetings on this in 1992-3.  European leaders and finance ministers have been looking at the ways in which they can establish a regulated system which will stand the test.  As yet that has not happened.  The European Central Bank and ECOFIN have been looking at the establishment of a regulatory system which can deal with enormous flows of money which are an abuse of how the system works.</P>

In their discussions it was decided that the system would not do any good if it was only operated in Europe.  President Clinton inaugurated the same system which is also in use in Hong Kong.  An effort is being made to include all the main players and central banks in one internationally recognised regulated system.  Any one of them doing it on their own will not work.  Nothing final has been decided, but everyone realises this matter must be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hosted a visit to Ireland under the auspices of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board between 18 and 22 October.  The visiting delegation included members of the board as well as some other prominent Irish-American business people.  The purpose of this visit was to brief the delegation on recent developments in Ireland, to avail of their advice and experience from the perspective of the US business sector, to generate and sustain a network of friends of Ireland amongst the Irish-American community, and to identify other opportunities where participants in the visit could be of assistance to Ireland.</P>
      <P>As well as meetings with me, the programme for the visit included engagements with the President; the Tánaiste, IDA Ireland and Forbairt, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Bord Fáilte, the Department of Finance, the Chairman of the Information Society Commission, the Chief Executive of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the IFSC, including representatives of Bank of Ireland's IFSC subsidiary, students and staff of the Michael Smurfit School of Business, Baltimore Technologies, an example of an Irish-owned software company, Wicklow Enterprise Centre, and representatives of the Irish venture capital industry and financial institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the main points to emerge from the visit were the priority which must be given to <Col N="1205" /> tackling Ireland's infrastructure investment needs and the possible use of US models for accessing private sector investment in public infrastructure; the need for a more proactive approach by financial institutions to the provision of capital for small Irish business; support for incubation units for small enterprises, particularly in the software and electronic commerce area; that Ireland should reduce its exposure to any one industry sector by having a diversified economic base; that members of the advisory board could be used to identify and cultivate contacts in specific industry sectors in the United States &mdash; for example, Brian Thompson who is a member of the board currently chairs the advisory group on telecommunications established by the Minister for Public Enterprise; the crucial importance of skills development and, in particular, postgraduate research and education, and the need to ensure a coherent marketing message in the United States from different State agencies.</P>
    <P>These and other ideas arising from the visit will be followed up through the relevant State agencies and Departments.  The next board meeting has not yet been scheduled but the practice for some years has been to have a meeting during the St. Patrick's Day period.  I intend to do this next March.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The board recommended that Ireland should not unduly expose itself to the vulnerabilities of one or two economic sectors.  Are there any sectors to which it could be said Ireland is currently unduly exposed in terms of over-investment? Does the Taoiseach agree biotechnology is one sector where there are opportunities, but because of increasing divergence in the approach to regulating biotechnology in the European Union US companies may not invest in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the regulatory system is not compatible, there is a danger that US companies will not invest in Ireland.  The board is seeking to identify the areas in which our industries should seek to diversify in European and world markets in the next ten to 20 years, including the next phase of software technology and e-commerce.  It considered the International Financial Services Centre and access to private sector finance in developing the economy.  As the Deputy is aware, members of the board have a range of skills in the financial, technological and manufacturing areas.  I thank Brian Thompson in particular for the work he has done since the board was established at the beginning of September.  It will present its report to the Minister tomorrow.</P>

      <P>On the second matter, if the regulatory system is not compatible, US companies will not invest here.  If the Deputy wishes to table a specific question, I will be glad to answer it.  While there are no major differences in the area of genetically modified organisms, there are difficulties which may inhibit investment.  On the first matter, it is not a question of overexposure but of diversifying our economic base.  If we keep pace with developments in the areas of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and software and provide the necessary infrastructure, we will succeed.  The advisory group states that we should broaden the base further.  It is not fear of over-exposure but that it would like to see the base broadened further.</P>

Has he discussed it with the advisory board and what is his view on the policy initiative?  The idea is to establish a European-North American transatlantic foundation in Ireland.  The Taoiseach received a copy some weeks ago of the policy proposal published by me on behalf of Fine Gael, and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has undertaken to pursue the idea.  Has the Taoiseach raised the idea with the advisory board as he could probably benefit from its advice on it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>My speech at the inaugural meeting of the National Economic and Social Council on 4 November 1998 has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In my address, I asked the council to prepare a new strategy report which would form the basis for a successor to Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> I suggested that it should reflect a vision for Ireland as an economy and as a society over a ten year period and should outline the steps to be taken within a three year programme to progress that vision.  It should especially take account of globalisation, EMU and the need to modernise our systems for managing domestic policy issues. I invited the council to explore innovative solutions to tackle problems such as the tightening labour market and the opportunities created by a sharp easing of the population dependency ratio for the next decade or so.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 has over a year to run and the Government is properly focused on implementing it.  This approach is being complemented by the putting in place of the necessary arrangements to prepare a basis upon which a new programme may be negotiated with the social partners.  The work of the NESC and the National Economic and Social Forum are an important contribution to that process.</P>
    <P>Substantive discussions have not yet commenced on a successor to Partnership 2000. However, I signalled in my address to the Partnership 2000 meeting in July and again at the inaugural meeting of the NESC that there is a need to develop a new approach to the management of public sector pay.  I suggested it was necessary to consider how a policy of relating pay more closely to performance can meet the aspirations of public servants while maintaining the unavoidable limits on public spending.  The Government is prepared to explore the options by which this might most effectively be achieved. I envisage that discussion will commence on these issues with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions following the budget.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach referred in his speech to sustainable economic growth, did he mean growth that is merely economically sustainable or growth that is also environmentally sustainable?  Could he indicate if those two aspects of sustainability have been put on the agenda for the NESC?</P>
      <P>When he asked it to examine the issue of inclusion, did he give it specific directives or understandings as to how the Government sees the issue being dealt with over the next ten years? What were those directives or understandings?</P>
      <P>In terms of performance related pay, will he indicate how it will apply to the Defence Forces, the Garda or teachers?  It would seem to be an extraordinarily difficult notion to apply in these cases.  How would the productivity of a teacher teaching a class be measured?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy De Rossa's first question, sustainability includes both employment and environmental matters.</P>
      <P>In terms of social exclusion, I spelled out at great length, both in my NESC and NESF presentations, the way I would like to see social inclusion develop in the period ahead, particularly in regard to those in society who are unable to work, whom the system has worked against and who do not have a proper education or job qualifications.  The main aspect is to help those with an educational standard to get a job.  We discussed many other issues also.  An enormous number of initiatives, in terms of policy documents were presented by NESF and they set out what it believes is a partnership approach where, over the next ten years or perhaps more, we can deal with disadvantage and social inclusion in Irish society.</P>
      <P>In terms of performance pay, Deputy De Rossa is right.  Any change in the present structure will be difficult and, in some cases, may be impossible to implement.  I am trying to open up new horizons where we can explore this issue away from what has been the traditional system of relativities. There is agreement across the trade union movement that the system of relativities is not a good one but we have to explore new areas.  In most Departments there are dozens of grades all linked to relativities regardless of what happens in performance pay or management, and we have to try to devise a better system.  I have invited the social partners to join with the Government in examining other ways to do that.  The Government is trying to put together some proposals which we will table in due course to the social partners to see if we can move away from the old system of relativities which is a system from another day.</P>

      <P>In response to the Taoiseach's last comments on the question of relativities and the invitation, which he has just confirmed, to the social partners to respond to this difficult issue, do I take it the Government does not intend to issue a discussion document on this matter?  Is the Taoiseach waiting for the social partners to come back to him?  In relation to the large number of grades currently in the public and Civil Service &mdash; a review of those grades is ongoing &mdash; has any progress been made with regard to their rationalisation? Does the Government intend to initiate a discussion on this matter by way of a paper or does the Taoiseach propose to stand by the invitation he has just mentioned and await the social partners response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy's question on the grades.  I am aware the Department of Finance is examining that issue.  I do not need to remind Deputy Quinn of the problems with the grades.  The Government has to come up with proposals; I do not think the social partners will respond.  We are engaged in examining not just what happens here but also elsewhere to see <Col N="1209" /> if we can come forward with a new system.  I hope to have that early in the new year when we open up discussions because we must move away from the old system.</P>

I have difficulty accepting that the best system we can have means that because a person working in a hospital who is one of perhaps 300 grades, which is possible in most of our health services, gets an increase based on some standards or negotiations, relativity applies to everybody regardless of what the group might have given in its determination to get that agreement. That is an unsatisfactory system which is costing this country enormous amounts of money, does not generate much staff satisfaction and is not particularly liked by the trade unions.  It behoves us to at least try to find an alternative system.  I add these remarks to what Deputy Quinn said about the number of grades, which is a major part of the problem.</P>

      <P>A series of taxation incentive measures have been notified to the Commission this year under state aid rules and these are currently being examined by the Commission under the relevant state aid articles of the EU treaties, which are Articles 92 to 94.</P>
      <P>Article 92, paragraph (1) indicates that any aid granted by a member state, whether by way of grant or tax relief, which distorts competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods, shall, in so far as it affects trade between member states, be incompatible with the common market.</P>
      <P>Article 92, paragraph (3) states that certain types of aid may be compatible with the common market, such as aid to particular areas as defined. These include aid given to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment, which comes under subparagraph 92(3)(a), and aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, or of certain economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, which comes under subparagraph 92(3)(c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State Aids Directorate of the EU Commission interprets these provisions of Article 92 in accordance with its own guidelines and with European Court decisions and in the context of recent relevant data on the areas involved.  More favourable state aid rules apply to a 92(3)(a) area <Col N="1211" /> than to a 92(3)(c) area.  At present a formal written response is awaited from the EU Commission in regard to a number of taxation incentive schemes, including the business tax provisions applying to the 12 acre extension to the Custom House docks area in Dublin and the business tax incentives in both the rural renewal scheme and the new urban renewal scheme.  These business tax incentives include capital allowances, double rent relief and rates relief.</P>
    <P>The Commission has traditionally taken a very negative position on operating aids, that is aid which relieves an enterprise of costs which it would itself normally have had to bear in its day to day management or its usual activities.  The Commission regards double rent relief and rates relief as operating aids as they reduce the annual profits of an enterprise for ten years for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The Commission's view, therefore, is that it is opposed on State aid grounds to the granting of double rent relief and rates remission except for small scale activities or locally based services in areas where physical degradation is associated with social disadvantage or high unemployment. The Commission now contends that these two reliefs should in general no longer apply for new projects in certain designated areas in Ireland because Ireland has now moved from a country coming under Article 92(3)(a) of the EU treaties to one coming under Article 92(3)(c) as a result of the significant improvement in the Irish economy. As mentioned earlier, much more favourable treatment is allowed for areas covered by Article 92(3)(a) as compared to Article 92(3)(c).</P>
    <P>These State aid rules apply to all EU member states and not just Ireland.  We are pressing to have the outstanding items cleared.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. The issue of State aid in different parts of the country is a complex one.  Is the Minister for Finance aware that State aid which would apply to manufacturing industry in an Objective One status area could reach a maximum of 57 per cent, and in an area outside Objective One it would be kept to 20 per cent?  Will he confirm that those areas to which future Objective One status will apply will have a maximum aid package of 37 per cent applying to them in respect of the location of industry?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister also confirm that areas like Cork, Dublin, Waterford, Limerick and provincial towns which were designated in the last budget for urban renewal will, as a result of today's Government decision, be outside the area for Objective One status?  There will be much less chance of the EU sanctioning the package of business incentives for urban renewal in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The questions posed by the Deputy have nothing to do with the question that he tabled regarding the sanction of the package <Col N="1212" /> of tax reliefs, which the Government wishes to apply to certain designated areas.  That was the Deputy's specific question to which I replied.  The Deputy went on to ask questions relating to Objective One status and the sub-regionalisation of the country.</P>
      <P>I will answer the question the Deputy put to me, although it has nothing to do with the priority question he tabled.  As regards the first part of his question, the Deputy may or may not be aware that on account of Ireland's increasing wealth we will fall into a new category of State aid regime as and from 1 January 2000.  At present, the Government and its sub-agencies are allowed to grant aid industry up to certain maximum levels. On account of our increased prosperity and the fact that we fall into a new category, those State aid maxima will be reduced as and from 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>In the second part of his question the Deputy asked whether different aid levels will apply if we sub-regionalise the country.  The answer to that question is yes.  We are quite positive in saying that if we sub-regionalise the country, the areas of the country staying as an Objective One region in transition will be able under the State aid rules to attract a higher level of grant aid than the areas in transition.  If we do not sub-regionalise the country as and from 1 January 2000 &mdash; it has nothing to do with the question of sub-regionalisation &mdash; the maximum levels of permitted aid to industry setting up here will be reduced for the whole country.  Therefore, there is an upside benefit in sub-regionalising the country for the purposes of Objective One status and Structural Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to discuss what taxation measures I may or may not introduce in the forthcoming budget. However, with regard to the question of a carbon energy tax, I would like to point out that there are many forms of carbon tax and it is important to emphasise that Ireland has relatively high taxes on energy use at present, particularly those that relate to motoring including value added tax and vehicle registration tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will also be aware of the carbon energy tax that was proposed by the European Commission in 1992 and on which no agreement was reached.  Following the failure to reach agreement on that proposal, the Commission introduced a proposed directive on the taxation of energy products in March 1997.  The proposed directive suggests increased taxes on items such <Col N="1214" /> as petrol and proposes new taxes on coal, gas and electricity.  There are also complex arrangements to assist energy intensive industries with both obligatory and optional provisions for relief from the tax suggested.  No level of agreement has been reached on the proposed directive and discussions are ongoing by technical experts reporting to the ECOFIN Council.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of other so-called green tax measures, I am sure the House is aware of the working group that was set up following the budget of 23 January 1996, whose remit is to examine the strategic impact of taxation on environmental policy.  This interdepartmental group, which is chaired by my Department, prepared a report which was discussed by the taxation strategy group in the context of the preparations for the budget.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that, in advance of the budget, I cannot comment on any taxation proposals which the group may have recommended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response.  The Minister will be aware that at the Kyoto conference on climatic change, Ireland subscribed to certain targets to be met before the year 2010.  He will also be aware that there is a widespread body of opinion that we cannot meet those targets without taking drastic action.  Has the Minister's Department commissioned any work to advise as to the financial and economic impact of the Kyoto targets, and what measures are being considered in order to meet them?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the agreements entered into under the Kyoto Protocol.  I am concerned about a number of aspects concerning how Ireland will implement it, particularly with regard to our international competitiveness, the effect that any such increased taxes would have on the consumer price index, and the impact that such taxes might have upon less well off members of the community.  These matters will be borne in mind in the Government's considerations of various proposals put forward by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in order to ensure that Ireland complies with its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on the difficulties facing the Government regarding some of the suggestions put forward by some groups as to how this problem should be tackled. As the Deputy is probably aware, in Europe and elsewhere it is felt that increasing taxation on some of these products is the way to lessen their <Col N="1215" /> use.  However, as I pointed out in my supplementary reply to the Deputy, that creates other problems. The Deputy is correct in saying that some of the figures put forward as to what the maximum increase should be &mdash; in order to reduce the usage of energy products &mdash; would have a considerable effect on the areas I mentioned in my supplementary reply.  Yes, I am so aware and that will be borne in mind by the Government.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the forecast outturn for expenditure by the Department of Health and Children, as shown in Table I of the Estimates for Public Services 1999, is more than £32 million less than the 1998 Estimates for that Department; if he will sanction the spending of this money to improve the health services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The forecast outturn figure for Vote 33 in Table 1 of the Abridged Estimates Volume for 1999 is a net amount and is a snapshot at a particular time of the evolution of both income and expenditure on the Health Vote as the year goes on.</P>
      <P>The health services are financed by taxation. About 90 per cent of the Health Vote is paid for by general taxes, such as PAYE or VAT.  The remainder is paid for mainly by the health levy of 1.25 per cent on incomes above the threshold &mdash; £207 per week at present &mdash; which is a form of taxation.  This appears as an appropriation-in-aid on the Health Vote.  Each year money is allocated for the health services which is spent irrespective of what the yield from taxes turns out to be.  What is important is the gross spending authorised each year.  What matters is the level of service provided and I would stress that the current year's allocation provides for an increase in spending of £258 million &mdash; more than 9 per cent &mdash; over the 1997 outturn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> As the House is aware, the Minister for Health expects to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the current year on Thursday next.  My Department has been informed by the Department of Health and Children that that Department has throughout the year consistently underlined to agencies and the public the determination to operate both the letter and spirit of the accountability legislation.  The Supplementary Estimate being considered will not, therefore, propose additional funding for increases in cost or activity which it has been made clear must, in any current year, be managed by agencies within the context of their service plan and annual determination.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that I and my colleagues in Government fully support the Minister for Health and Children in his management of the health services and in particular in his efforts to maintain financial discipline and accountability in line with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recall that when he presented the Book of Estimates last Wednesday he made a film presentation in the press centre?  In the course of that presentation he pointed to figures on the screen and said that the increases in expenditure were offset by substantial reductions.  The Minister went on to say that the overruns of £131 million in the Garda, prison officer and Agriculture Votes were being offset by savings.  He identified savings in social welfare and health the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the time is limited.  I have discovered that already.  The Minister said he was applying £42 million of savings on the Department of Health and Children Vote to cover over-expenditure in pay.  There was, I presume, a run of £10 million on the health pay Vote.  Therefore, there is a net saving of £32 million on the Health Vote which the Minister said he would use to cover overruns on Garda and prison officer overtime.  Can the Minister confirm that even though the Minister for Health and Children is spending his full Estimate and overrunning by approximately £30 million on demandled schemes and other aspects, there is still a saving on the Health Vote arising from the 1.25 per cent health levy which the Government has no intention of spending on the health service this year and which is being treating as normal taxation buoyancy which will accrue to the Exchequer.

      <P>The Deputy knows, or should know, the realities of the situation.  After Deputy Bruton's performance last week which indicated his lack of knowledge of the Health Vote, net, gross and appropriations-in-aid, I am not surprised he failed to get two budgets through the House.  His knowledge of the Department of Finance was poor.  Whatever about anyone else in Opposition, Deputy Noonan knows the amount of money allocated to the Department of Health and Children is the gross amount.  Money collected from taxpayers goes to the Exchequer.  It is irrelevant whether the Exchequer regards that money as general taxation or youth or health levies. The Deputy knows the gross amount is the amount which will be disbursed.</P>
      <P>The amount provided at the start of 1998 will be below that which the Minister will spend and there will have to be a Supplementary Estimate. These are the facts.  The Opposition had a field day last week about the accounting arrangements. However, Deputy Cowen and I have explained that was all it was.  There is no saving on the Health Vote.  Last year I agreed a 9 per cent increase in the Health Vote but the outturn will be greater than 9 per cent.  The Estimates for next year provide a gross allocation of £3,479 million. This represents a double figure increase on the 1998 outturn.</P>

      <P>The second edition of the national changeover plan which I published last January, sets out what the public sector will do to facilitate the changeover to the euro.  The plan states that staff, pension and social welfare payments will continue in Irish pounds until 1 January 2002, but that from the commencement of EMU next February, the public sector will accept payment in euros where it is offered and where a supplier presents an invoice in euros, payment will usually be made in euros.</P>
      <P>Departments are responsible for ensuring that they, and bodies under their aegis, will be ready to meet their commitments.  All Departments are concerned that this will be the case.  The plan also contains specific entries about the plans for the start of EMU in my Department, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>From the start of EMU all budgetary, financial and economic publications from my Department will provide summary information in euros and the accounts of the Exchequer and the Paymaster General with the Central Bank will be in euros. Central Bank operations in the Irish wholesale money and foreign exchange markets will be denominated in euros.  The Revenue Commissioners will accept payment of any tax in euros and Irish pounds.  They will also accept returns and declarations in euros from companies and for self-assessed income tax, subject in the case of some tax heads to an irrevocable election to adopt the euro as the reporting currency for that tax head.  Details of the Revenue Commissioners' plans can be found in Revenue and the Euro Changeover &mdash; A Business Guide, published earlier this year.</P>
      <P>New issues of Irish Government bonds, bills and notes which would otherwise have been denominated in Irish pounds or other currencies being replaced by the euro, will be denominated in euros.  Outstanding Government bonds, bills and notes which were issued in, and are to be redeemed in, Irish pounds will be redenominated in euros.  Details of the technical arrangements for the redenomination are set out in an information booklet published by the NTMA last June.  I recently signed an order under section 23 of the Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998, in relation to the redenomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> Payments into the Government's personal savings scheme, operated by An Post as agent for the NTMA, will be accepted in euros and Irish pounds.  Withdrawals from such schemes, except those from demand deposit accounts at post office counters, may be made in euros or Irish pounds.  The bodies involved have confirmed that they will be ready to meet their commitments under the plan.  I will launch the third edition of the national changeover plan tomorrow.  This edition will not affect the commitments set out above.  As with previous editions, a copy of the third edition will be sent to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The presumption seems to be that big business and large Government agencies may choose to do business in euros, but ordinary consumers will not.  It might be regarded as perverse if they were to choose to do so.  What will happen if an ordinary taxpayer, consumer or small business person doing business with a Department presents a cheque made out in euros?  Are Departments and agencies which deal directly with the public geared to deal with individual customers in euros?</P>

      <P>Every Department will be able to accept payments in euros.  This applies to cashless transactions.  No one can ask for euro notes or coins, even in banks, as they will not be available until 1 January 2002.  However, people can make tax and other payments in euros.  Departments, agencies and their suppliers will be given the option of accepting payments in euros.  Suppliers who wish to be paid in euros will have to open a euro bank account.  That will be the position from 1 January 1999 until 1 January 2002. From that date euro notes and coins will be in circulation and Irish notes and coins will be withdrawn in the following six months.  By 30 June 2002 at the latest, people will be dealing in euro notes and coins.</P>

      <P>One sector in which I expect there to be considerable competitive advantage is the tourism sector.  From 1 January next year, people from member states joining EMU and who intend to holiday in Ireland will at least know that the rate of exchange will be set and will not change after that date.  The same will apply to Irish people planning to holiday in Spain, Portugal, Germany and other member states within EMU.  That should, if anything, be a boost to tourism because the exchange rate risk will be removed after 1 January.</P>

      <P>Ireland broke its link with sterling in 1979.  Since then Irish operators in the tourism and other sectors which do business with the UK have had to contend with a fluctuating exchange rate with sterling.  That will continue until, if ever, the United Kingdom decides to join EMU.  In some years, Irish people going to the UK will have the advantage while in others, visitors from the UK will have the advantage. However, we have lived with that for the past 20 years.</P>

However, in the run up to last year's budget I was criticised for the lack of information that was made available. Budgetary matters should be treated this way.  I am aware there has been speculation about a variety of issues relating to the Estimates for a considerable number of months.  Most of it was a good deal wide of the mark.  However, I am certain none of the speculation emanated from the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>This pre-budget secrecy is unjustifiable and antiquated.  It is bizarre that a Minister would attempt to justify it in the 1990s. With the exception of one or two decisions in last year's budget, there was nothing in it that could not and should not have been properly discussed in committee and elsewhere in the House for some weeks before the Budget Statement was made.  What justification can there be for maintaining the tradition of budget secrecy?  Would the Minister agree that it is merely an excuse for Ministers for Finance to avoid engaging in debate and justification of their policies until they make the statement in the House?</P>

      <P>The Deputy and I probably agree on a number of matters of public policy but this is one on which we have a fundamental disagreement. I am probably in disagreement with many Members on both sides of the House in this regard.  Matters related to budgetary policy should not be leaked in advance.  I have always held that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>How is one to decide which item can be leaked or discussed and know it will not cause damage or will cause little damage?. The easiest way to deal with this is to have no leaks prior to the Budget Statement.  Many reasons for this policy have been put forward and I can put forward a number of others.</P>
      <P>The leaking of information could have an extremely adverse effect on the financial interests of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is absolute nonsense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It could also compromise the ability of the Government to manage the national economy or&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That script was written in the 1960s.  It is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it could result in an unwarranted benefit to individuals.  The amount of speculation before the Budget Statements of the last Administration was such that the budget was well known before the Minister stood to speak in the House.  For a number of years before that, there had been an increasing amount of budgetary information in the public domain before the Budget Statement was made in the House but it reached a ridiculous stage during the last Administration.</P>
      <P>That is not the appropriate way to do financial business.  I have held that view for many years and it will not change during my term of office. It is one of my strong beliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the Minister holds this belief, his only justification for it is the trite nonsense the Department has been peddling for several decades.  It is clearly out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> I do not suggest that there should be speculation based on leaks.  However, would it be more appropriate if proper presentations were made of the Estimates, since they are probably the more important part of the budget package&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and of some of the taxation changes being contemplated?  Could these presentations be made to a committee of the House in advance of the Budget Statement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> article on the question of primary education, which I welcomed, was accurate.  The Minister should try to trace the source of that leak.</P>
      <P>Overall I would agree with the Minister.  I would have to disagree with my colleague, Deputy McDowell.  It is important that the budget should remain a secret until the Minister announces it here.  It gives it more credibility. This is especially the case if there is an increase in the price of petrol, for example.  If the Minister signalled that beforehand, we would all be queuing up to get petrol before the price increase. People would be hoarding it.  There was an occurrence of that as regards cross-Border trade a few years ago where there was speculation.  I am sure the Minister will confirm that this element of secrecy will continue to surround the budget in the future while he is Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will endeavour to continue it.  I intend to adopt the same procedure which I adopted for last year's budget.  I will try to guard against leaks as best I can.</P>
      <P>The question Deputy McDowell raised with regard to the debating beforehand of the Estimates and possible taxation measures is a separate matter altogether.  If the Members of Dáil Éireann decide in the future that the Estimates process and the taxation measures of the budget are to be done in a different way or format as applies in other member states, then that would put a different complexion on this.  As it is at present, it is important that this information be kept until budget day.  Deputy McDowell and I will have to disagree about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it then if I were to propose to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service that we might look at ways in which the Estimates could be debated in advance of their announcement, that the Minister would support giving the opportunity to a committee to look at it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter to which I must give further consideration.  What I said was that <Col N="1227" /> if the Members of Dáil Éireann decided on another way of doing the Estimates, the Minister for Finance would abide by it.  Personally I see nothing wrong with the methods which we apply at present.  They work quite well.  Over the past years with the growth of the committee system there has been considerably more in-depth analysis and debate given to all the Estimates.  That has been a good thing.</P>

      <P>The debate we had in this House was about two 13 county regions.  Rumour has it, because that is all we have to go by at <Col N="1233" /> present, that Clare and Kerry have been added to the proposed Objective One region.  Can the Taoiseach confirm that is the case and that this is not the issue around which a debate was held last week?  We had a debate about a 13, not a 15 county region.  How can the Taoiseach justify including Galway, Clare and Kerry and excluding Limerick west and Cork west, for example?</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Is the Taoiseach aware that of the six Bills promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for publication before Christmas, only one, the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill, has been published? The Taoiseach said the volume of legislation being turned out by the Minister is superb. However, the only things being churned out by the Minister are prisoners.  The people voted overwhelmingly in a referendum to change the bail laws.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: In June 1997 both Houses passed the Bail Bill which gave effect to the wishes of the people.  It is now November 1998, yet, apart from dealing with offences against the State in the wake of the Omagh bombing, we have not given legal effect to this legislation. When will the full legal effect be given to the bail Act?</P>

As the Deputy knows, full implementation of the bail arrangements was linked to the availability of prison spaces.  Enormous strides have been made in the prisons' capital programme as a result of contracts made by the Minister in the past 18 months. When the full arrangements are made I will ask the Minister to communicate with the Deputy.</P>

I understood the Taoiseach to say he would discuss possible legislative changes to split the mid-west region and to split the Cork-Kerry region for EU aid purposes in Brussels.  There is an issue of privilege here in that any proposals for legislation approved by this House should be discussed with this House before being discussed with an external authority so that this House does not become some form of a rubber stamp for something that has been agreed elsewhere.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that the House will be consulted in full about any proposal that will be made by the Government to the European Union that would involve changing arrangements that have been approved in this House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for agreeing to my request to address Dáil Éireann on the important subject of railway safety.</P>
      <P>Rail safety is not just my business, it is everyone's business.  I know that all Deputies are concerned about rail safety and I have spoken privately with many elected Members of this House about the issue.  Ireland is a small country and railways still play an important in people's lives. Rail has been the lifeblood of many rural areas. While the golden age of rail may have occurred in the distant past, as far as I am concerned we are again entering an era when rail transport will play an increasingly important role in the economic and social life of the country.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the rail system is safe or as safe as can be guaranteed in any form of human endeavour.  I cannot wave a magic wand and decree that any transport system is or will be 100 per cent safe.  No one can do so.  However, I assure everyone that what is laid down in this safety blueprint will be realised during my tenure of office.  The Government and succeeding Governments of every political hue must undertake to carry the burden of investment recommended in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that, following the derailment of a passenger train at Knockroghery a year ago, I commissioned, with Government and Dáil approval, an independent review into all aspects of rail safety.  This was undertaken by a consultancy <Col N="1242" /> team led by International Risk Management Services &mdash; IRMS.  The commissioning of this independent study was supported by the Opposition and welcomed in a Dáil resolution in December of last year.</P>
    <P>I have already made copies of the consultants' report available to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and it has also been published.  I will also make it available to all members of staff in Iarnród Éireann.  Last Thursday I addressed Seanad Éireann on the report and was happy to note the high degree of interest shown by the Members of that House in the matters raised by consultants.  I have no doubt but that Members of this House share that interest.  The report is clear and unambiguous in its analysis and I urge Deputies to consider it carefully.  The report is very detailed and it would be impossible to cover every aspect of it here today.  I will therefore concentrate on providing an outline of the main findings and the Government's response.</P>
    <P>There are probably few issues on which we will find greater agreement in this House or elsewhere than that the avoidance of death or injury should be the paramount guiding principle of all railway operations.  I am satisfied that Iarnród Éireann is committed to this principle.  Iarnród Éireann's safety performance over the years compares well with other national railway systems.  That is not just my view; that statement is made by the consultants in the very first sentence of their conclusions. The good safety record of the Irish railway is due in large measure to the skill and experience of railway staff over the years, a point also acknowledged by the consultants.  Nevertheless, it is clear from the report that the consultants have concluded that there is a need for significant improvement in the safety of the railway.  The task, therefore, of the Government and of the boards, management and staff of CIE and Iarnród Éireann is to use the analysis, findings and recommendations of the report as a springboard to create the conditions for a major improvement in rail safety.</P>
    <P>Railway transport has an enviable safety record worldwide and in Ireland, especially when compared to the competing mode of road transport. I believe that if ten people were stopped in the street and asked whether it was safer to travel by car or by train, they would select the latter. Besides, statistics do not lie.  The last major railway accident in Ireland was in 1983 at Cherryville, 15 years ago, when seven people died.  Yet similar numbers are killed on our roads every week, and sometimes over a single weekend the toll can be as great.</P>
    <P>However, we should never allow ourselves to become complacent.  We must never lose sight of the fact that, although the nature of rail travel makes it inherently safer than road travel, rail safety ultimately depends on safety conscious railway personnel working with safe infrastructure and rolling stock and relying on rigorous safety management and procedures.  Even then, <Col N="1243" /> we can never take rail safety for granted.  No matter how good the infrastructure or how vigilant the staff, it is a sad fact that even on the best railways in the world accidents happen.  Ultimately absolute rail safety can never be guaranteed. The recent high-speed train crash in Germany is proof that no transport system is 100 per cent safe.  That was a state-of-the-art railway system which enjoyed massive investment in financial terms.  Tragically, that crash claimed the lives of more than 100 people.</P>
    <P>The consultants' brief required them to consider the adequacy of Iarnród Éireann's safety policy, systems, rules and procedures and the adequacy of the company's arrangements for implementing these rules and procedures on the ground.  They also considered the adequacy from a safety viewpoint, of the existing railway infrastructure and facilities, including track, signalling systems, rolling stock and level crossings, bridges, embankments and so on.</P>
    <P>The consultants carried out their work in a very rigorous way.  They looked at best railway practice worldwide in order to establish the benchmarks against which Iarnród Éireann's safety performance could be measured, but they did much more than that.  They literally walked the line. They inspected over 60 per cent of the rail network and looked in detail at samples of all the infrastructure, including track, signalling, structures, level crossings and rolling stock.  They also spoke to the individuals on the ground.  Many Iarnród Éireann staff were interviewed and they talked informally to many others as they travelled in locomotive cabs with drivers or visited signal cabins.  They sent a questionnaire to all Iarnród Éireann staff and one in eight replied across all departments and grades in the company. Deputies might think this a low response rate, but the consultants found it to be satisfactory for this type of study &mdash; given the numbers employed, several hundred people in Iarnród Éireann replied.  The consultants were full of praise for the unstinting co-operation which they received from the company and its staff.</P>
    <P>They concluded that the condition of much of the track, signalling and other infrastructure was poor, while the condition of the rolling stock was on the whole satisfactory.  They also acknowledged that a shortfall in investment in recent years was impacting on safety.  They found that a recently laid continuous welded rail track was in excellent condition, though in need of a safety management system to ensure its continuing safety over time.  They concluded that large sections of the older jointed track was in poor condition, particularly on secondary lines.  During the debate on Knockcroghery Deputies Yates, Stagg and I agreed that if consultants discovered that remedial work was needed that should be reported to us and to CIE and work should go ahead.</P>
    <P>The consultants found eight serious safety failures on the signalling system when they would <Col N="1244" /> have expected to find none.  This finding shocked them because the chances of a signalling error resulting in a serious rail crash are high.  They found that much of the telecommunications equipment was in poor repair.  They also identified problems with level crossings such as inadequate braking distances from the signals protecting the crossing to the crossing itself and poor signposting and road surfaces.  They noted the lack of formal systems for preventive maintenance and inspection of structures.  Fencing was poorly maintained in many areas.  The condition of rolling stock was largely satisfactory, with no major safety concerns noted.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the impression created by some media reports, the DART was found to be in reasonably good condition.  Concern was expressed about some aspects, such as the need for greater attention to the electric power supply system as it gets older.  The DART has been in use for 17 years now, so we are coming to the time when it should be looked at.</P>
    <P>While safety related investment in railway infrastructure is necessary, it will not be enough in itself.  The consultants found that Iarnród Éireann needs to urgently tackle the management aspects of safety as well.  Indeed, they went so far as to say that the benefits of infrastructural investment would be transitory if not accompanied by a programme to improve safety management systems.</P>
    <P>The most serious safety management deficiency that they found was a lack of a systematic approach to identifying safety hazards and prioritising and implementing remedial action where this is necessary.  The consultants stressed the importance of improving the company's approach to safety management on the railway and of instilling a safety culture throughout the organisation that would apply from general operative to top management.  They emphasised the value of better training and improved documentation and procedures.  They acknowledged that an encouraging start had been made at senior management level in implementing a systematic approach to addressing safety on the railway, but stressed that much more needed to be done, especially to ensure that such an approach applied throughout the company.  The consultants estimated that a 15 year safety investment programme costing in the broad order of £590 million will be required.</P>
    <P>This overall expenditure requirement includes about £230 million for a programme of improvements to rectify safety deficiencies in the railway infrastructure &mdash; that includes track, signalling, bridges and level crossings.  Of that £230 million, about £60 million is earmarked for improved management of infrastructural safety.  The consultants suggested the expenditure of a further £60 million to improve safety management systems generally throughout the railway and £20 million per annum over the 15 year period for ongoing renewal of the permanent way.  About £23 million of this £590 million needs to be spent <Col N="1245" /> immediately, and about half of the total should be spent in the first five years.  IRMS concluded that this investment programme will be sufficient to restore the railways to a condition where they can operate at existing timetable speeds and with a substantially reduced risk to the safety of passengers, staff and public.</P>
    <P>It is fine to commission a report but it is another matter entirely to do something about it. We will not be found wanting in that regard.  I am setting up a high level task force &mdash; that is the second recommendation of the report.  The task force is holding its first meeting tomorrow and it will report at the end of January.  The report recommended the immediate establishment of an implementation group.  We will continue to use IRMS as matters proceed, for public audit, advice and consultation.  This is consistent with the consultants' recommendation that implementation plans should be agreed within three months of the publication of the report.  It is pointless having the benefit of this report without putting in place a structure to have its recommendations implemented.</P>
    <P>I formally presented the report to Cabinet on Monday and I met the board of CIE on Monday evening and the unions on Tuesday.  CIE has been requested to begin implementation of the report's recommendations, giving particular attention to the immediate safety needs.  CIE will be authorised by the Minister for Finance to undertake borrowings to finance the implementation of safety measures.  CIE is a public company, owned by the taxpayers and operated by the Government on their behalf.  Whether it is borrowings or Exchequer funds, it is still public money to be used judiciously for safety.  There is nothing wrong with that and it is entirely exemplary.</P>
    <P>CIE has a statutory borrowing limit of £250 million and the current figure for borrowing is £153 million.  When I met the board, the finance officer was present and he spoke about the need for the company to show a profit.  I am not that keen on making a profit &mdash; I want the safety recommendations implemented.  One can hardly call it a profit when there is a subsidy of £109 million this year for services which Iarnród Éireann is giving to young people, pensioners and those living in remote areas etc.  The finance officer did not say a profit was to be achieved at the expense of safety.</P>
    <P>The consultants also paid particular attention to the role of the railway inspecting officer in my Department &mdash; the job is done by John Welsby, who is a miracle man of sorts.  The consultants recommended a significant expansion of the functions of the inspectorate and called for additional staff to meet both existing and future commitments. We are now beginning the process of recruiting two additional railway inspecting officers, as recommended.</P>
    <P>I am determined to make progress on improving railway safety.  With that in mind, I have asked the CIE board member who chairs the company's <Col N="1246" /> safety committee to report to me directly at regular intervals on progress.  I have also decided that there will be regular independent audits on the progress being made on implementing the safety measures.  This is in line with the consultants' recommendations.</P>
    <P>They have told us what we have to do and we have to go ahead and do it.  We will distribute a large number of reports among the regional workshops.  I will have meetings before and after Christmas in which we will discuss the report.  I want each worker to have ownership of this report, to believe it is for his or her good and to work through it with me and CIE in order to be part of the public audit process which will show what has been done.</P>
    <P>I see this consultative process with employees as a first step in bringing the board, management, trades unions and each and every member of the railway staff together to work, with a sense of urgency and common purpose, to implement the recommendations of the consultants.  The report provides a clear framework.  When I went to Cabinet with the proposal to commission an urgent railway safety report following Knockcroghery &mdash; I was extremely shocked when I drove out to Knockcroghery and saw what could have happened &mdash; people told me I would be in a great deal of trouble when the report was published because I knew what the recommendations would be.  I would prefer to be a transport Minister who had issued a safety charter than to be a transport Minister who did not know what was going to happen next.</P>
    <P>There will be accidents and the reporting group left me under no illusions about that yesterday. We must gradually implement the recommendations of the report which states what must be spent each year.  We will have to work with CIE management, the board and the employees.  We must have an annual public audit, and an espousal, monitoring and assessment of the work &mdash; both the hard and soft issues, though it will be more difficult to assess the softer issues despite the money allocated to them because it is more difficult to assess the full inculcation of a safety culture.  I commit myself to it.  I asked the Chief Whip ten days ago if he could allocate time to debate this report.  I commend it to the House and I look forward to the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report and the alacrity with which the Minister facilitated the debate. While I have numerous criticisms of her, being accountable to this House and debating matters here is not among them.  She is always quick in coming to put her case.  I notice that in all the material circulated by her Department, the Minister did not mention the other international report by Arthur D. Little which was published in May.  I am relying on both reports, carried out by English consultants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  However, it is interesting to compare routes and risk ratios in both reports.  The Department, in assessing the situation, should also be mindful of the Little report.</P>
      <P>The time for analysis of rail safety is over.  I hope this debate marks that change in dealing with this issue.  Action must replace analysis.  The IRMS report and the Little report provide compelling conclusions that a serious train accident involving fatalities is virtually inevitable unless major investment and review of procedures takes place.  If Deputy O'Rourke was not Minister, I would say the same thing &mdash; I am genuinely fearful there will be a major accident in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I take her point that, as is the case on the roads, no-one can guarantee safety. However, if an accident happens because of a derailment as a result of inadequate track or faulty signalling that is 40 or 50 years old, that could have been eliminated.  As on the roads, no one can guarantee safety but it is a risk that can be eliminated in terms of a derailment because of defective track or faulty signalling that is 40 to 50 years old.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not do the job of rail safety officers or Iarnród Éireann managers; rather she should provide the cash for investment, something that the board and management of Iarnró d Éireann cannot do.  The sum required over a period of eight years to bring the entire rail network up to the standard achieved on the Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Belfast routes is £640 million.  The period of 15 years suggested by the IRMS is too long.  Because of speed restrictions and traffic volumes the Athlone-Westport, Arklow-Rosslare, Limerick Junction-Rosslare routes as well as the Nenagh branch line would be left to last in any track renewal programme and services would virtually cease in the period suggested.</P>

    <P>The A.D. Little report recommends investment of £128 million in level crossings, of which there are 2000.  The IRMS recommends a figure of £15 million for this purpose.  It has made an error in its calculations.  It assumes that in the event of an accident and subsequent litigation liability will fall on a landowner who allows stock to stray on to a railway line.  The reality is that Iarnród Éireann will be held liable for injuries to passengers <Col N="1248" /> and damage to track and rolling stock, as happened in the Claremorris incident in the early 1990s when the courts decided in a multi-million pounds action that the landowner was a man of straw and CIE had to foot the bill.  I understand Iarnród Éireann has negotiated a package with farm organisations to upgrade level crossings but this is not provided for in the IRMS report.  The Department should address this issue urgently.</P>
    <P>Between 1955 and 1983 35 people died in rail accidents, including 18 in Buttevant and seven in Cherryville.  The IRMS states unambiguously that if £230 million was spent on safety measures and £20 million per annum on track renewal, risk levels would reduce by 50 per cent over a 30 year period.  We are advised that each year there are 92 derailments and 18 collisions, mainly on sidings.</P>
    <P>Unless £640 million is spent over a period of eight years, the Government is playing Russian roulette with the rail network.  Its response to date has been less than inspiring.  To sanction additional borrowings of £23 million is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £153 million.  The viability of CIE is constantly threatened by the cost of debt servicing. The only effective Government financial response is direct subvention or grant-in-aid for capital expenditure.  There is no point in placing an albatross around its neck in debt servicing because of extra borrowings which are unsustainable.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a task force to report by the end of January safely steers the Government past this year's budget on 2 December and next year's Book of Estimates thereby heightening the short-term risk of an accident.  I was looking forward to the Minister stating that she was pleased to announce that the Government was committed to providing the necessary funds or that her colleagues had secured the additional finance necessary to fully implement the report as that is the acid test.  How many more reports does the Minister need?  Endless analysis is leading to paralysis.</P>
    <P>Capital investment of £80 million per annum is required over a period of eight years.  This would match the request made by CIE to the Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport at which Mr. Michael McDonnell and his colleagues indicated a figure of £650 million was required for investment in the suburban lines, of particular concern to Deputy Stagg, the intercity rail network and rolling stock.  There is a risk of a derailment because of defective track and a collision because of inadequate signalling.  Rail safety cannot be compromised any further.  Signalling at Heuston and Cork stations must be modernised. A programme must be put in place to provide concrete sleepers, continuous welded rail and automatic signalling on the Mullingar-Sligo, Athlone-Westport-Ballina, Kilkenny-Waterford, Rosslare-Arklow and Mallow-Tralee routes.  This should be done urgently.</P>
    <P>My biggest fear about public transport investment is that by the middle of next year the Minister <Col N="1249" /> will have the bright idea of procuring the funds by deferring or abandoning the Luas project. This debate must be seen in the wider context of national public transport needs.  A sum of £671 million is required for the Luas project&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What is required is a new strategic approach.  At a time of declining EU resources this money cannot be obtained from the usual source, the public capital programme.  Therefore, a new strategic approach will be required.  Either private sector investment will have to be used to meet public transport needs or the proceeds of privatisation will have to be set aside and earmarked for this capital expenditure.  I have heard many anecdotes about the Luas debate concerning what did and did not happen and what was said in Cabinet.  What worries me is that I see no evidence of the Government taking ownership of and responsibility for this requirement.  The Minister for Public Enterprise is in the front line when it comes to dealing with the issue.  It is necessary for the Government to put it at the top of its agenda.  This is ultimately a political dilemma requiring a policy solution and a new strategic, long-term approach.</P>
      <P>There are a number of specific points I wish to raise with the Minister.  She has stressed heavily that the most significant recommendation in the report is not investment but safety systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that to be current rather than capital expenditure because it involves such matters as additional personnel and databases.  Is it the Minister's intention to examine the CIE annual subvention in the context of safety and make that funding available?  Is it intended to introduce legislation on the Health and Safety <Col N="1250" /> Authority?  Will some of the new procedures in the report which refer to the legal situation require amending legislation?</P>
      <P>Will the Minister deal with the conspiracy theories which always abound about the relationship between Ministers and semi-State companies? She has, in her tenure, made a number of decisions.  She appointed a human resources manager from Aer Lingus to deal with the difficulties with the viability plan.  He is to report to the Minister directly.  There is a feeling that a damaging shadow has been cast on the existing relationship structure between the board of CIE, the Minister and her Department.  A watchdog was put in place for Luas who was to report directly to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Many safety officers are now also to report directly to the Minister.  The conspiracy theory is that the Minister has established lines of communication which deviate from the traditional pattern and avoid dealing with senior management and the board of CIE.  Does this reflect a lack of trust or a breakdown in communications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>No, that was an entirely differently matter.  I would consider that to have been a head-on row.  If the Minister is not satisfied with the management of CIE, she should say so and deal with it as she thinks fit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Indirect procedures of reporting are perhaps an ambiguous way of dealing with it and they lead to suspicion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was more direct communication with the board I had in mind.</P>
      <P>The report also refers to the DART.  It is striking that the DART has been in place for 14 years and no additional rolling stock has been acquired. That strikes me as a chronic failing of management, the board, the Department and successive Governments.  It is one of the most successful stories of public transport in the Dublin area and yet people cram on to it similar to Tokyo because there is not enough space.  The same can be said of the Arrow trains.  The report signals a surprising lack of adequate maintenance and checks on the overhead electrical cables and track.  This is of concern given the manner in which people are crammed into the trains.  I understand seats have been removed so there is more standing room.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1251" /> I suppose it is sensible given the relatively short journeys but it is also necessary given the lack of rolling stock.  I met the DART management last week and I understand the earliest that additional rail cars which have been ordered will be running will be almost 2001 which strikes me as incredible given the time between planning and action.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for sending me a copy of the interim decision recommendations.  I too was shocked by what was found by IRMS on individual tracks.  When Iarnród Éireann says all these have been repaired, I must take it as read.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I take Iarnród Éireann at its word.  Perhaps if the Minister is conducting an audit, there should be a random spot check system as part of that.  This would entail a surprise visit, perhaps half yearly or quarterly, and a certain section of track being selected and studied in detail.  It would mean there being ongoing reporting.  It would not just be a case of implementing the systematic investment and controls but also conducting spot checks to see if there has been further deterioration in tracks.</P>
      <P>It has been well established within two years that there is a predictable, intolerable and unacceptable risk to rail safety.  In some cases, it amounts to a political decision of investment or closure of the routes on safety grounds.  An investment programme must be implemented which will not only make railways safe but will also be part of a public transport solution given the inevitable limitation through gridlock of the private motoring solution.  One of the solutions to the unplanned growth of Dublin could be the development of satellite towns which would be communities in their own right and which would be directly linked to Dublin by rapid rail.  It would mean people working here living in designated large towns in Wicklow, north Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The tube is reliable, quick, safe and comfortable.  People will only be lured out of their cars and into public transport with such a service.  I welcome the report.

      <P>I warmly welcome the opportunity to comment upon the recent of review of rail safety by IRMS on behalf of the Minister.  She <Col N="1252" /> has done a good day's work in commissioning the review.  Its findings are of immense concern to Members, the travelling public and all committed to developing an efficient public transport system in Ireland.  However, the findings of the report should not come as a surprise to anyone with an interest in rail transport or public transport in Ireland.  The detail of this report reveals the appalling neglect that public transport services, especially the rail service, have endured over the past two decades.  It tells the story of a rail system that has been starved of resources to such a point that there is now an urgent need to invest approximately £590 million to ensure the safety of the system for passengers, rail staff and the general public.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on taking the initiative to commission the report.  We are no longer dependent on anecdotal evidence or descriptions of isolated incidents.  We now have a reliable base from which a reasoned debate on rail safety and public transport investment can develop with a planned action to follow.</P>
      <P>This report is only a first step, however, on the way to ensuring that our railways receive the investment they require over the coming years. The Minister now has the task of convincing her Cabinet colleagues, and my constituency colleague in particular, Deputy McCreevy, of the need to invest the necessary funds in our railways. Making the system safe will also allow for its orderly expansion and development.</P>
      <P>Neither is it acceptable that State transport companies should be obliged to engage in wholesale asset stripping to raise the required finances. Such short-sighted, pawn shop action will reduce the potential of the company to create its own income stream and will prevent it expanding its services in future.  The sale of the Harcourt Street line is a case in point.  It is ironic that the old Harcourt Street station has now been sold and converted into a public house.  I wonder if any of the patrons leaving that pub who have to wait for a bus or taxi to take them home realise they have just vacated a building that was availed of by a fine suburban rail line serving south Dublin.  The sale of land for housing in Maynooth beside the railway station is another example.  That land is now needed for park and ride but it is no longer available because houses have been built on it.</P>
      <P>It is not an enviable task for the Minister, and the ideological bent of her coalition partners will not help her in this regard, but it is a battle I will follow with great interest in the coming months. Before I comment on the detail of the report I will turn to the broader issues confronting public transport policy that underline the findings of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our rail networks are creaking to a halt.  We are now faced with the necessity of investing nearly £600 million just to ensure the existing network is brought up to a reasonable standard of safety.  These facts are an indictment of public transport policy over recent years.  This policy has its roots in a right-wing ideological <Col N="1253" /> opposition to the concept of public service provision and the very existence of public transport companies.  It is an ideology that took root in the 1980s and was best exemplified and articulated by the Thatcherite regime in Britain.  According to this view, public transport provision was uneconomical and unwieldy, and its role could easily be taken over by private companies operating solely on profit and loss criteria.  The raft of privatisation in Britain during the 1980s was based on this view.  The results of this policy are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>That view also held sway in this country.  While no party in Government pursued the privatisation route, the denigration of public transport and the companies that delivered this service was widespread. At times, the right-wing consensus was that public transport companies should operate on a commercial basis.  Subsidies to public transport companies were perceived as feather-bedding by the State.  If these companies could not break even in the market, they must cut their roots, their workforce and their services until they are in the black.</P>
    <P>This is a view of public transport that neither I nor the Labour Party ever held.  We do not believe the economic and social benefits of public transport could be fully accounted for by profit and loss sheets.  We are in favour of efficiently run public transport where taxpayers money is spent wisely and accounted for fully.  We never bought the lie, however, that the whole public transport system can be sustained on commercial criteria alone.  This has not been achieved anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>While recognising the EU-driven imperative for competition, the Labour Party will oppose any attempt to privatise the rail system in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The chaos affecting transport reached crisis point in recent years.  The reality that poor infrastructure and traffic gridlock, costing the economy money in the long-term, has eventually dawned on even the most conservative commentators.  Gridlock now costs Dublin £1.3 billion per annum.  Imagine what the Minister and the public transport companies could do with half of that amount per year while saving the other half for the people of Dublin.  There are costs outside of Dublin also, including social costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality that efficient public transport makes a contribution to society and the economy, above and beyond the entries on profit and loss sheets, has also dawned on many commentators, including many in this House.  This new belief in public transport is a welcome development on the political landscape in Ireland.  The Minister's coalition colleagues are often the first to claim that every party in the State has come round to their view and their vision of society.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and the debate surrounding public transport is evidence of that. If anything, parties, including the two Government <Col N="1254" /> parties, are falling over themselves to adopt a social democratic approach to public transport, which I welcome.  I recall the Minister's late brother, Brian, who was a good friend of mine, saying in the House that he was a socialist and made no apologies for that.  I am glad the Minister is following in his footsteps.</P>
    <P>This report, and the serious investment needed to ensure its recommendations are acted upon, requires this and subsequent Governments to demonstrate their commitment to public transport. The question is simple: does the Government believe in having a railway network?  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, then it is imperative that the investment of £590 million is made to ensure the network is safe for staff, passengers and the general public.</P>
    <P>That this scale of investment is needed is not in doubt.  What is in doubt is whether the Government has the political will to make the investment, and the battle now before the Minister is to convince her colleagues, and the Minister Deputy McCreevy in particular, to put our money where their mouths are.</P>
    <P>For many years serious questions arose regarding rail safety.  These concerns arose not only from reported &ldquo;near misses&rdquo; on the rail network but were obvious to anybody who had occasion to use the rail network.  Crowded trains, with passengers forced to stand or sit in passageways, were and still are common practice.  Slow train speeds due to the age of track the rolling stock passed over were noticed by all passengers.  The fact that many inter-city trains were too long for platforms in mainline stations was farcical.  This led to passengers having to step off the platform onto the track to retrieve bicycles or parcels from the guard room on the last carriage of the train. These are instances which ordinary passengers could notice.</P>
    <P>The report commissioned by the Minister demonstrates that there are more serious and fundamental safety problems to be addressed.  The key point that much of our rail network has been allowed to deteriorate to such a condition that passengers, without any technical knowledge, could tell that matters were getting worse is important.</P>
    <P>We now have a sound basis on which to judge the conditions of our railways.  The safety report details the failings of the rail network in a number of areas.  It should also be noted that the report has confined itself to the safety aspects of the rail network.  The investment in improvements urged in this report would not only improve safety but would also have additional commercial benefits for the rail system.  The authors of the report made this point and it is a salient one.</P>
    <P>The report highlights the inconsistency of track quality across the network.  It rightly points out that track quality is unacceptable across large sections of the network, particularly the secondary lines.  The report rightly draws attention to the safety implications of this state of play.</P>
    <P>Above and beyond the safety reasons for <Col N="1255" /> investing the necessary resources to improve our quality of track are the commercial benefits.  Better quality track will provide both a smoother and quicker journey for rail users.  The improvement in service could attract more customers on to the rail network on the secondary routes.  While the commercial benefits of increasing safety are important, however, they should not dictate our method of investment.  While I doubt if one extra passenger will consider using our railways because a new signalling system has been installed in Heuston Station, the need for this type of investment is beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>One of the most revealing aspects of the report is where it refers to the lack of a structured approach to safety among Iarnród Éireann staff. This is symptomatic of an organisation starved of funding, that has been required to operate for many years on a sticking plaster basis.  The report notes that:</P>
    <P>There is a lack of consistent application of standards and plant maintenance.  Training and development in safety policy procedures was not satisfactory.  There is little evidence of a strong safety culture operating across the company as a whole.  Occupational health and safety issues received a low priority.</P>
    <P>This appalling situation is a direct result of the organisation being starved of sufficient funding. Tackling these problems should be a priority, both for Iarnród Éireann and for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another key area examined by the report concerns regulation of the railways.  Because Ireland has a different railway gauge to the rest of Europe &mdash; an historical problem we have to live with &mdash; the report notes it is unlikely that other railway companies will seek access to our rail network. However, the report makes commonsense recommendations regarding the operation of the railway inspectorate within the Department of Public Enterprise.  I commend the Minister for acceding to the recruitment of two additional inspecting officers.  She might be in a state of shock at the amount of praise she is receiving today, but I believe in giving the maximum credit where credit is due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of credit, the financing of this package is one of the most important issues now facing the Government's rail policy. The Minister gave clearance for CIE to increase its borrowings by more than £23 million to start work on safety improvements.  Does she intend to finance all future rail safety investment through borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, who will repay the loans?  Will it be the future passengers of the service?  The Government owns the rail system and it is the <Col N="1256" /> duty of the Government to make the necessary investment in the company to make it safe and viable.  I remind the Minister that Bord na Móna was allowed to borrow large amounts of money that nearly put it under.  CIE has already borrowed heavily and it is unacceptable to add to that debt burden to deal with this problem.  I am not taking away from the fact that the decision to allocate £23 million was made with speed.  That is welcome, desirable and necessary but I would be worried if the trend was towards borrowing for further investment.</P>
      <P>The returns on this investment should not be judged on the basis of an accountant's balance sheet.  Returns must include many other items as well, such as the environmental benefits of the railway system as opposed to private transport, including cars, and the use of roads for freight. These items should be factored into the balance sheet.</P>
      <P>The safety of rail passengers should be compared to the carnage on our roads where more than 400 people have died this year alone.  It is 15 years since the last major accident involving fatalities on the rail system.  I pay tribute to the staff of CIE, who have been demoralised by the lack of funding in their system.  They have, however, still operated a system where passengers have been their prime concern and safety is at the top of their agenda.  We must also factor in the economic and social benefits of the railway system for more remote communities.</P>
      <P>When I was a child we put pennies on the railway track and the passing train would enlarge their size making them about as big as halfcrowns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We then tried to paint them silver and pass them off in the local shop, but it never worked.  I had a devious mind even then, as the Minister can see.</P>
      <P>The area that track ran through was bought by farmers and is now used for silage pits.  Because of the excellent drainage along the railway system, the run-off from the silage pits runs straight into the river Robe and pollutes it very quickly. It is a pity that the railway to places like Ballinrobe and Clifden were not maintained or even mothballed because they would be widely used now.  I would not like to see any more such closures occurring.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to commission this report.  She moved quickly on the report, bringing it to Cabinet, as well as on the management and unions at Iarnród Éireann, and obtaining sanction for the initial £23 million of funding.  I also welcome the establishment of the required task force to implement the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The game of pass the parcel concerning this long neglect of the railway system, whereby everybody and nobody was responsible, is over.  I am not sure who has ended up with the parcel &mdash;<Col N="1257" /> the Minister or her Government colleagues.  The parcel has now been opened, however, and only wilful neglect will prevent its contents from being dealt with.</P>
    <P>This debate is similar to the one we had on mental handicap recently.  No one ever knew the extent of it, but we now have a database on it. We also have a database on the extent of rail safety and the need for railway development. Ministers and Governments can no longer put sticking plasters on this matter.</P>

      <P>I join in complimenting, thanking and congratulating the Minister for recognising the necessity to examine rail safety in a comprehensive and studied manner.  She set about doing that with urgency and the net effect is this report. As she rightly pointed out, previous Ministers would have shrivelled in the face of the report's contents.  The Minister was conscious of what was likely to emerge from it.  She wanted a carefully focused and concentrated analysis and examination of the situation, which she now has.  In commissioning the report, the Minister was also conscious that it would not be presented to her as something to be shelved.  It has to be acted upon with immediate, medium and long-term responses.  The Minister has already indicated her intentions and there is little doubt about them, given that for the first time there is a sub-heading in her Department's Estimate describing public transport investment.</P>
      <P>It would be improper for us to criticise what has occurred in the past.  To be honest, very little happened and, consequently, a succession of Governments and Ministers took things more or less as they were.  We have now arrived at the position where serious difficulties are associated with rail safety and interdependent matters. Safety is acknowledged by everyone as being centrally important to any public transport service. While it is stated in the report that the safety record of Irish public transport has in the main been comparable with anywhere else in Europe, nevertheless, having got away without serious accidents for many years, the law of averages suggests that the risks are there and that sooner or later an accident will occur.  We all hope and pray that will not happen but we are confronted by the reality that the likelihood is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Committee of Public Enterprise and Transport, of which I have the honour of being Chairman, visited Germany. Shortly before our visit, two major rail crashes occurred there, within a week of each other.  The accidents happened in a state of the art rail system that we went to examine and learn from.  The same thing could happen here and more than likely will.  We must acknowledge, <Col N="1258" /> as does the report, the importance of the physical condition and safety of the rail infrastructure. We must also pay close attention to safety management systems and to the processes and procedures associated with them and we must examine the role of rail regulation.  The Minister is already actively engaged in improving all these areas.  Government approval has been given to Iarnród Éireann to borrow £26 million. The borrowing capacity of Iarnród Éireann is considerable.  This is an immediate response which acknowledges the steps which must be taken immediately after the publication of this report.  The Minister was successful in getting Government approval for this borrowing and it is disingenuous to criticise her because this funding is not being directly provided by the Government. The Minister has evaluated the safety needs of the rail network and the Government has decided what must be done and has set about doing it.</P>
    <P>The lack of investment in the rail network over many years is now having a serious impact on safety.  The crisis has existed since 1983.  Now that the Minister is tackling the problem she is being given half-hearted congratulations.  She must confront the problem, find the money to solve it and go about doing that in a prudent way.  When this report was published the Minister immediately indicated her intention to speak to management, unions and staff.  These three groups must recognise the need for closer and more realistic interaction among them to ensure that safety measures are pursued and implemented.</P>
    <P>The report highlights signalling as an area of high risk.  The signalling systems in many parts of the country are extremely dangerous.  The Cork, Belfast, Limerick and Dublin suburban lines have modern and centrally controlled computerised signalling systems which incorporate the most modern safety features.  The Sligo, Galway, Tralee and Waterford systems are currently being equipped with the mini-CTC computerised system. The remainder of the network, that is the Rosslare, Westport and branch lines has mechanically operated signalling systems which are very expensive to maintain.  They need to be replaced. It must also be acknowledged that the Heuston Station to Cork, Limerick and Waterford lines have signalling systems dating from the 1920s and 1930s which are in urgent need of renewal.  A major task has been identified and must be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In pursuing the task of improving signalling we cannot ignore the improvements needed in rolling stock.  While the report shows that rolling stock is comparable with what is available elsewhere, improvement is needed.  Some people who have considerable experience in the area of transport and should know better have failed to acknowledge the Minister's commitment to provide by the year 2000, 16 additional DART carriages as well as the ten already ordered, 20 extra suburban rail cars in addition to the 27 new carriages already ordered, extended DART and suburban station platforms to cater for longer trains, <Col N="1259" /> the doubling of the rail between Clonsilla and Maynooth to cater for improved suburban rail services and new signalling and rail track improvements on the Mallow, Killarney, Cherryville, Kilkenny, Mullingar and Carrick-on-Shannon lines.  Before the report was published, the Minister had already engaged in elements that are central to the safety formula which she now seeks to achieve.  One cannot separate improvements in signalling safety from the other improvements to which the Minister has already committed massive investment.  The Minister's commitment to the upgrading of rolling stock and the replacement of jointed track by continuous welded track is indicative of her intention to provide the country with a modern transport system which will attract increased usage by the public. The Minister has already observed the trend towards increased rail usage.  Once again she has acknowledged that if she provides an efficient, effective and safe public transport system and can meet the requirements of the modern commuter the trend towards greater usage will continue. The Minister has achieved much in the short time since she assumed responsibility for public transport. As Chairman of the Select Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport I point out to the House that we have already made a commitment to improving the rail system which has been neglected for many years.  We will soon see the public show their confidence in public transport by a massive increase in its use and an end to the days of traffic gridlock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The rail system is an efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport.  At a time when the road system is in danger of choking to death my principal regret is that we do not have a more substantial rail system.  Forty years after Dr. Todd Andrews cut a swathe of destruction through our railway network we can acknowledge the short-sightedness of that policy. It is ironic that 40 years after the last train ran on the Harcourt Street to Bray rail line, CIE is surveying the line, rebuilding bridges that were demolished and reclaiming the permanent way to facilitate the Luas project.  Had the Harcourt Street to Bray line not been closed so prematurely in the 1950s it could have been providing the same efficient DART service as the coastal line and saving huge traffic congestion in much of the southern suburbs of Dublin.</P>
      <P>The potential of rail to reduce traffic flows through Dublin has not been fully exploited.  One does not have to be a traffic engineer to recognise that a huge element of the traffic congestion in Dublin arises from the volume of container lorries travelling to and from the port.  Given that there is an existing rail network from the port to the outer suburbs, a much more serious effort should be made to get this container traffic off the streets and on to the railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail system is an enormously expensive operation and eats up the vast bulk of the £100 <Col N="1260" /> million subsidy which CIE receives from the Exchequer.  Contrary to a widely held misconception, Dublin Bus receives only £7 million in subvention. Despite the cost, money spent on the rail system is well spent.  The railways cause little environmental damage or pollution and are a lifeline to many communities along the lines.  It should also be emphasised that, despite the worrying findings of the report, railways have generally been a safe mode of transport with a safety record as good or better than any of the alternative means of transport available.  No mode of transport is entirely safe; people are killed in horse-drawn carriages and falling from bicycles.  However, given that powerful trains carry large numbers of people at high speeds, we have to ensure that safety standards and procedures are of the highest levels possible.  Unfortunately, the report suggests that this is not the case.  That we have managed to avoid a disaster has been due more to luck than to planning and standards.</P>
    <P>Even more worrying than the lengthy list of hazards and potential dangers listed in the report is the consultants' findings of a lack of a systematic approach to identifying safety hazards and prioritising and implementing remedial action.  It was also alarming to read of major shortcomings in the data collected and collated by Iarnród Éireann.  According to the consultants there was little information as to the extent of the injuries incurred, there was double counting of incidents and a failure to break down the data into meaningful categories.  This is unacceptable in modern times.  Proper statistical information is vital if we are to understand the problem and decide on appropriate corrective measures.</P>
    <P>The consultants talk in clinical and detached terms about acceptable risk levels, intolerable risk levels and monetary values for the prevention of fatalities and injuries.  For the family of a passenger or staff member killed in an accident, or for someone maimed for life, there is no acceptable risk level and no value can be put on the loss of a limb or a life.</P>
    <P>The report states that there is a potential risk of about ten train accidents, collisions or derailments in fair-paying passenger services per year in the short-term if no improvements are made, and that these risks could result in about 7 equivalent fatalities per year.  These are relatively small numbers compared to the numbers who die on the roads each year.  However, as with air travel, only one major accident is required to result in huge casualty figures as we have seen from a number of train disasters in Britain and the devastating derailment in Germany this year.</P>
    <P>A number of findings in the report caused me particular concern.  Huge amounts of money have been spent improving the physical appearance and facilities for passengers at Heuston station with the opening of new shops, bars and restaurants. This is welcome investment.  However, it is alarming to find that the condition of the signalling system at Heuston, probably the busiest <Col N="1261" /> mainline station in the country, was singled out for criticism.  The signal box wiring and much of the mechanical signalling system at Heuston was found to be in very bad condition.  Eight serious safety failures were exposed associated with signalling. According to the report, normally it would be expected that no such failures would be found on this kind of inspection.</P>
    <P>Signalling is crucial to the safety of the rail system. It was a fault in the wiring of the signalling system which led to the Clapham Junction disaster ten years ago which caused 35 deaths.  In addition, while people will not have been surprised that some of the permanent way on lesser used sections of the network was in poor condition, it is alarming to find that such strong criticism was made of the state of the line between Sandycove and Dun Laoghaire.  This section of line is used not just by mainline trains going to the south-east, but also by dozens of DART trains each day carrying thousands of passengers. The line was rebuilt 15 years ago but the consultants found that sleepers are decayed; the coarse stone on the line is nearing the end of its useful life; many bolts were missing; and the absence of broken bolts indicated that this situation was of long standing.  The report also found that ballasts was inadequate and that the concrete-bedded track had failed in several locations.  Given the volume of traffic on this line, repairs and upgrading on this section must be given a priority.</P>
    <P>The consultants found that the rolling stock was generally in good condition but they do not seem to have assessed the dangers arising from over-crowding.  Virtually every mainline train at weekends has passengers standing.  These passengers are often crammed into corridors and toilets. The same problem exists on the suburban line serving places such as Castleknock and Maynooth. Unlike DART carriages, mainline carriages are not designed to carry standing passengers. Should an over-crowded train be involved in a serious accident, the consequences for standing passengers would be horrific.</P>
    <P>There is also evidence that industrial relations tensions are not conducive to tackling important safety issues.  Surely safety is one area where there is a common interest between passengers, management and staff.  I appeal to the trade unions in CIE not to allow industrial relations problems in other areas to prevent the implementation of the highest possible safety standards that could save lives and avoid injuries to passengers and staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister has announced a number of initiatives arising from the report.  I welcome the decision to appoint two additional railway inspectors and to establish a high level task force to prioritise the necessary rail safety expenditure requirements.  However, I wonder if we are treating the matter with the urgency required.  Some of the proposals will take time but there must be no delay or equivocation in implementing the report.</P>
    <P>Apart from the issue of life and limb, there is <Col N="1262" /> another consideration.  Having identified the shortcomings of the rail system in the report, it is likely that the courts will grant significant compensation to anyone who suffers as a result of a delay in dealing with these problems.  The potential exposure to the taxpayer in the aftermath of a serious rail accident might put other claims with which the State is familiar into the halfpenny place.  For all these reasons a great deal of urgency should be given to implementing the recommendations in the report and the measures proposed by the Minister.  I welcome this important debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this report.  We must congratulate the Minister, not for bringing this report before the House, but for the action she took 12 months ago after the Knockcroghery derailment when she decided that there was a need for a thorough review of the entire rail system.  That action led to the publication of the report before the House.</P>
      <P>The report contains some details which are frightening and others which are positive.  It is positive that CIE and its workers are to be complimented for their safety record which has been quite good.  However, they are working with antiquated equipment, signalling and lines which are nearing the end of their operational life.  The gridlock in Dublin has drawn attention to the lack of investment in the rail system.  The number of cars entering and leaving the city mean that one can only travel at certain times or else what should be a two hour journey from the country can take three and a half hours.  An efficient rail system would help alleviate some of the traffic coming into the city and the problem of rising house prices.  An efficient rail system which took people to work in an hour would mean that they would be prepared to live in rural areas, including those as far away as the Minister's constituency.  People would be prepared to deal with the housing crisis if there was a rail system which took people from Mullingar or Athlone to Dublin in one hour.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the proposals in the report, a number of matters become immediately apparent. One is the condition of the rail track and signalling systems which require urgent attention. The Minister's decision to make money for this work immediately available and to monitor the implementation by CIE of the report's recommendations is to be admired.  The imposition of timescales for the implementation of the recommendations is also extremely positive.  These actions will lead to a better and safer rail system.</P>
      <P>Certain sections of track have been identified as being in need of urgent work which will require cash investment.  That was already recognised by the Minister and the Government.  Provision had already been made for work on many of these lines, particularly the line from Dublin to Mullingar to Carrick-on-Shannon which was considered a priority.  It was a positive initiative in upgrading that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> This report signals a new beginning for the rail system.  It is an opportunity to bring it from the 1940s and 1950s into the new millennium and to provide an efficient service that people will be anxious to use to a much greater extent.  One often hears criticism of our rail charges but they are extremely competitive with the fares charged in the UK and in Europe.  The charges are quite reasonable.</P>
    <P>Special credit should be accorded to the CIE workers at this time.  For several years operating on a shoestring they have maintained an accident free rail system.  This could not have been achieved without the dedication of those who walked the lines and maintained the system to a standard that other countries had achieved only through massive investment.</P>
    <P>Urgent investment is required in the signalling and rail system.  It might be worth considering leasing systems from those who win the competition to instal them, as happened in the case of Government offices when decentralisation took place.  It would mean that the capital requirement would be spread over a longer period and the Exchequer could use the surplus funds to accelerate the upgrading of other areas of the rail network. Much of the rolling stock needs to be upgraded and that must be tackled when the rail and signalling systems are brought up to standard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision of extra money for DART carriages.  It is most important.  On the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; programme on RTE radio today, a DART driver spoke about a serious problem with regard to how people behave on the DART. Sometimes it is used as a venue for drinks parties which are held while the train travels from one end of the line to the other.  That is not acceptable. The assistance of the Garda Síochána might be required by CIE personnel to prevent this type of behaviour, particularly at weekends.  The problem must be tackled as soon as possible to reassure the public.</P>
    <P>The same driver was extremely critical of the lack of investment by Fine Gael when it was in Government.  I will not discuss that now; Deputy Enda Kenny can discuss it with his colleague, Deputy Yates.  The driver was scathing in his comments on the lack of investment in and commitment to the rail system.</P>
    <P>The rail system must be transformed into a system that will serve the public into the 21st century. The Minister has set about this task with a will and I do not doubt that at the end of her term of office, she will have done more for the system than any other Minister in the past 20 years.  She will also have helped to ease the burden of travel on commuters into the city.  Travelling in Dublin has become a major problem and all possible alternative transport means to cars and buses must be considered.</P>
    <P>The extension of service that should be possible with the provision of a proper signalling and rail system will lead to better and more frequent <Col N="1264" /> train services, particularly between cities.  Continuing investment in the rail system will always be required.  Technology continually changes and progresses and if we do not move with technological changes, we will be left behind.  Consumers will not be encouraged to use the service if it is not highly efficient and geared to the needs of its users.</P>
    <P>The service should inspire confidence in the public.  Confidence is a byproduct of safety.  If people feel safe on the train, they will travel on it more often particularly if it can offer the same travel time as the car.  It is less frustrating for the commuter to sit comfortably in a rail carriage than to get stuck at lights or behind a juggernaut on his or her way in and out of Dublin.  The latter can add anything from five to 50 minutes to one's journey time.  Sometimes the delay can be longer.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on her work.  It is only 12 months since the derailment at Knockcroghery.  In the meantime, the Minister has put in place a full review of rail safety which has taken into account the interests of all users, including the passengers, CIE workers and CIE management.  The programme for upgrading rail safety has strict timetables for the work that is required.  I have no doubt that the Minister will ensure they are followed.  That is important for the development of the rail system.</P>
    <P>If an efficient system is not achieved, there will continue to be too many cars on the roads and worse traffic gridlock.  An efficient rail system would greatly enhance the lot of commuters, particularly to Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not contribute to this debate to congratulate the Minister; she is not seeking such congratulations.  She is simply doing her job and I commend her for her decisiveness in respect of the safety report.</P>
      <P>I am a firm supporter of the rail system.  It is possible to move more passengers per hour by rail than by any other method of transport.  There is a clamour among the public for a good, efficient, safe and comfortable rail system.  If there were such a system, it would be used by a huge number of people.</P>
      <P>The Department of Public Enterprise was a weight on the shoulders of many Ministers for years due to lack of investment and difficulties in the semi-State sector.  Iarnród Éireann was always one of the bodies not to be tangled with by whatever Minister had responsibility for that Department.</P>
      <P>The rail system has a sad history.  The railways and the stations were the focus of sorrow due to being linked with sad goodbyes to emigrants. Archive material shown by RTE is evocative of memories of thousands of people leaving railway stations in rural areas forever.  Most were never to return.  These scenes are part of our history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saddest sight, however, is that of derelict rail tracks and stations throughout Ireland at a time when Europe is investing heavily in rail systems. Too many of ours were not only closed but <Col N="1265" /> destroyed or sold.  One need only think of the west Clare line, the Galway-Clifden line, the Westport-Newport-Achill line and the line from Claremorris to Ballinrobe.  The latter was one of the last lines to be closed.  Deputy O'Rourke has an opportunity to make progress.  Just as Knockcroghery was famous and renowned because of Jimmy Murray who captained the Roscommon all-Ireland football champions, it became famous for focusing attention on the derailment which occurred there some time ago. That there were no fatalities can be attributed to good fortune.  It has focused the attention of Government and Iarnród Éireann on the initiatives required to upgrade the rail system.  That the Minister Deputy O'Rourke commissioned this report is valuable in itself.</P>
    <P>I will make a few general and specific points about the line to the west.  The rail system is a fundamental part of our economic expansion. One can move more people per hour by rail than by any other mode of transport.  There is a huge clamour in the public to have that kind of system.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Ellis, I listened today to the DART driver on the local radio programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have heard it but I am sure it will be taped for her.  He said that nobody after 8 p.m. pays for a DART ticket because checkers are afraid to be on duty, that young people use the DART carriages as drinking dens, abusing, mugging and interfering with passengers.  In the context of a late-night DART service over Christmas even on an experimental basis, there is a need for a thorough investigation and analysis of what he alleges is happening on the line.  With the population of Dublin continuing to rise north-west and south-west of the city, the rail lines will be increasingly important.</P>
      <P>This is a good factual report.  The Minister is right not to set up another task force because she knows what needs to be done.  The attitude among some Iarnród Éireann staff has changed because of the perception of a financial injection into the rail lines for the future.</P>
      <P>Page 108 of the report states that the sections where the track condition contributes the highest risk are those from Connolly Station to Mullingar and Athlone to Claremorris.  We are all aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the situation is not as bad as people paint it.  Credit is due to the staff of CIE who have carried on under enormous clouds of low morale over the years attempting to keep this system in operation.  There are a number of things which can be done now without any great cost to the rail line which would enhance the public reaction to the service.  For instance, if a wheelchair disabled person wishes to travel from Heuston to Ballina tomorrow, the station personnel along the route can be informed that a person will be travelling by wheelchair and the portable ramp will <Col N="1266" /> be provided to assist them to board.  In addition, there is a space in the dining cars for a wheelchair or two.  That is a start towards giving public access to a greater number of people who would avail of that system rather than use buses or cars.  I used the trains for many years.  However, nowadays train times do not suit me.</P>
    <P>Trains are often late due to safety reasons. Recently a person travelling by road reported old lines thrown down beside where new ones had been put in place.  He thought the line had been up-ended and reported this out of a sense of public duty.  The trains were delayed for an hour and a half while the matter was checked.  That the Knockcroghery incident occurred has focused a new impetus in this area.</P>
    <P>The report states that one of the most serious problems relates to deficiencies in the line west of Athlone and there are proposals to insert continuous welded rail over the next two or three years.  While it is 86 miles long, the Minister might be able to tell us how much of that programme will be completed next year and the year after.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>People are willing to listen to the response of Government so long as they know the plan.  Recently the train broke down between Ballyhaunis and Castlerea and it was stranded in the dark for 40 minutes.  No announcement was made to the public about what was happening because the train driver was trying to start the train.  There is a need to improve communication with the passengers.  There should have been an announcement to the passengers to the effect that the train had broken down and it would take 20 minutes to restart it.  This is what is done at airports where, because of a technical fault, one could be hanging around for four or five hours. Improved customer care is important.</P>
      <P>With regard to continuous welded rail, the lines to Galway, Sligo, Cork and Belfast will be of continuous welded rail in about 12 months and the Minister can then concentrate on the western line.  When doing it, I would expect Iarnród Éireann to address the number of manually operated gate crossings from Athlone west.  These slow up trains because a driver cannot go through them at 100 miles per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see a system whereby one can book seats in advance.  If one buys a ticket, it does not mean one is entitled to a seat because some people who buy tickets must stand.  Ticket sellers should not grossly oversell the number of places on the train.  Standing is no joke even for an able-bodied person.  How much worse must it be for a pregnant woman or an elderly person to have to stand as far as Athlone on a train which can be quite rocky and uncomfortable?  There should be a system such as those which apply in every other European country whereby one can ring up and buy a ticket knowing one will get a seat.  Overcrowding occurs particularly on Fridays and Sundays <Col N="1267" /> or on the occasion of a big match where there are too few carriages and there is gross overcrowding.  It leads to all sorts of anti-social behaviour on the train and makes it uncomfortable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>The safe electric token system, with which few accidents occur, will be replaced with the new system.  I have not understood the difference in fare structures between Westport to Dublin and Dublin to Westport.  The same structure should apply east-west as west-east.  I think the difference arose from a mentality that suggested that people never wanted to go west, that people always went to Dublin.  The Minister might look into that and equalise fare structures.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for her decisiveness in this matter and for the impetus in the restoration of the rail lines.  I would like to think that in ten to 15 years, there will be a decent rail system which is efficient, reliable and cost effective which will be used safely by many hundreds of thousands of people on a daily basis.  I will support the Minister all the way on that.</P>

      <P>I mBaile Átha Cliath amháin, is féidir linn a fheiceáil gurb é an DART an modh iompair is fearr sa chathair mar tá sé glan, is féidir brath air agus tá sé nua.  The DART is only 14 years old.  It provides a high quality service and is generally reliable.  As there are ten DART stations in my constituency, I am conscious of the level of use of the DART from morning until evening and the great service which it can provide.</P>
      <P>I was somewhat alarmed at some of the things which were stated in the Review of Railway Safety in Ireland, which refers also to the DART. Whereas the report stresses that the DART is in good overall condition, it highlights major faults which it has identified on a local basis.  These faults seem to fall into two categories: structural problems on the line and, more worryingly, maintenance problems.  On the line itself, it gives numerous examples of areas in very poor condition. The report refers to decayed sleepers between Sandycove and Glenageary and splits, loose chair screws, ballast being choked and missing bolts.  It draws attention to the fact that if bolts are missing, they did not go missing today or yesterday but have been missing for some time.  The report also tells us the slab track, which is bedded in concrete, along part of the route from Dún Laoghaire to Sandycove has failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the DART was built a number of the footbridges had to be raised in height to accommodate the DART going under.  It now appears the workmanship in those footbridges is faulty, it <Col N="1268" /> is corroded and the extensions added to the footbridges at the time have a major safety question mark over them.  What we are most familiar with in dealing with rails and the DART are the overhead conductor lines because people are conscious not to hit them.  Very often we hear news about a fault at the Merrion Gates where something has hit the lines.  It is particularly worrying to read in the report that the DART has neither the level of skilled manpower nor access to equipment to cope with a system as it degenerates with age, given that it is only 14 years old.  What this report is telling us is that in terms of safety the DART system is operating on borrowed time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister commissioned this report to be carried out.  Had it not been carried out we might never know of the danger which could potentially exist.  The report addresses problems of maintenance on the line. Sometimes structural problems might not always come to light until they are properly investigated but where there are manmade problems there are no excuses.  The report found there are underlying weaknesses, including inadequate control of redundant wiring and out of date working drawings which have been subject to alteration in an uncontrolled manner.  This is in a system where two bodies are working together to ensure the safety of the DART, the centralised traffic control centre and an automatic train protection system. These two groups are meant to work in tandem, yet there is no planned servicing of signalling and other vital equipment &mdash; the inadequate maintenance included defective insulated joint detectors, dirty signal lenses and poor maintenance on colour light signalling.  Is it that the staff did not know these problems existed or, worse, is it that they knew and did not attend to them?</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann and all of us, given that this information is available, have a responsibility to ensure accidents do not occur.  The warning is there for us in this report that an accident is waiting to happen on the DART but the problems have been highlighted sufficiently in advance. God forbid that there should be an accident on the DART because the major problem of overcrowding is not addressed in the report.  No matter what time of the morning rush hour you take a DART, for example, in Dún Laoghaire, you will have to stand the whole way into town.  From Dalkey station into town the DART takes 30 minutes.  People have to stand on the DART at 7.40, 7.50, 8.00, 8.10 and 8.20, not in comfort but like sardines jammed into a can.  The usual practice is to shove passengers into the carriages so that the doors can close.  If for any reason the driver has to brake, everybody moves forward in a great surge.  Recently &mdash; on the one hand this has to be welcomed for safety reasons &mdash; inspectors have been getting on the coaches to remove people from the DART.  This is happening when we are encouraging people to use the DART and leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>I visited one school this day last week, a rainy <Col N="1269" /> day, where 161 students arrived late for two reasons: first, because the buses passed them full and, second, they had been removed from the DART.  These are people who live on the DART line, who are going to a school on the DART line and yet are unable to use it.  On the one hand I welcome the fact that somebody is taking a safety responsibility but on the other the DART is not able to service the people whom it should service, those who live on the DART line.  There are problems also where thousands of people emerge from the DART in such places as Tara Street and Westland Row, onto very narrow exits leading onto the street thereby causing terrible congestion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new initiative taken by the Minister in ordering six new DART carriages which will boost capacity by 30 per cent.  I hope in ordering the 16 used carriages she will not have made the mistake of thinking that the ten which are already on order will be able to meet the needs by the time the carriages arrive.  Anybody could have told whoever ordered the ten that at least 20 carriages were needed at that time.  The ten have not arrived yet, but I hope the 16 will not be far behind.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the extended platforms which will ensure that when we get the extra carriages they will be able to pull up on the platform.  There has been much development in the whole DART area, particularly the new Dún Laoghaire station opened by the Minister.  Some 10,000 commuter journeys start or finish in that one station alone each day.  It is an important station because it is a tourist port.  Very often it is the first place an overseas visitor will visit when they come to this country.  Therefore, it is important that it conveys a modern and progressive image.  The DART is the solution to keeping people off the roads.  It should provide a good public transport service and encourage people to make the best use of the facilities.</P>
    <P>The report presented today raises so many serious questions about the safety of the DART that now that we have the information we cannot ignore it.  We are glad to have it.  I have been assured the Minister will ensure accidents are averted.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the rail safety report and related matters.  One of the main problems here is traffic congestion and while it is particularly bad in the greater Dublin area, there is hardly a town in the country that has not been affected, especially those areas along the main economic arteries.  A great deal of money has been spent on improving roads, yet they cannot cater for the increase in car numbers.  Given NCB <Col N="1270" /> stockbrokers' prediction of an increase in car numbers from today's level at just under 1.2 million to 1.6 million by the year 2006, the future for road users is one of long queues and long hours. However it does not take a genius to realise this problem can be greatly alleviated by ensuring we have an effective and efficient public transport system.  Unfortunately, this is not the case and as International Risk Management Services point out in their report, there has been a shortfall in investment in recent years, so much so that it is now impacting on safety.</P>
      <P>If one turns on any chat show one is almost guaranteed to hear Iarnród Éireann's public relations man trying to defend the indefensible as irate users of the service vent their anger.  The Rosslare-Dublin line runs through Wicklow and so disgruntled are the users of that line that they formed an east coast rail users action group.  The group was formed in response to the lack of reliability of the east coast rail service and, in particular, the commuter service for Greystones, Kilcoole, Wicklow, Rathdrum and Arklow.  Users are frequently stranded, uninformed of delays or cramped into overcrowded and substandard carriages. Some 1,000 users of the service in the county have signed a petition calling on the Minister to ensure that trains arrive and depart as per schedule, which is not an unreasonable request, that in the event of delays an appropriate announcement is made to passengers and that all carriages have basic standard facilities, such as light and heat.  Many more elaborate requests were made.</P>
      <P>This poor service is not a reflection on the rail workers but on the failure of the Government to make the necessary investment.</P>

      <P>It has been a failure of several Governments.  People who depend on that service to get to and from work are regularly let down. Children, who must travel from these towns for their education, are often forced to spend long hours on stationary carriages and waiting for trains which do not arrive.</P>
      <P>There was great disappointment in the area when the Minister did not allocate funds, which had previously been earmarked for the Luas project, to this route.  The report on rail safety classified the Bray-Arklow route as the sixth highest stretch of line in the passenger individual risk category. I hope the Minister urgently addresses this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently received a reply to a parliamentary question in which the Minister stated that the infrastructural element of the DART extension to Greystones will be completed in the spring of 1999 and that Iarnród Éireann may run a partial service while awaiting the arrival of new carriages in the autumn of 1999.  I fail to see how this can be the case given that the company cannot provide an adequate service at present.  Can the <Col N="1271" /> Minister confirm when the new carriages will be operational as I am afraid this will not happen until 2000?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of rolling stock for commuters from Kilkenny to Dublin is totally inadequate.  As the rail network is now regarded as a way of alleviating the overcrowding on our roads, it must be made more efficient.  Commuter services from places, such as Kilkenny which is not too far from Dublin, should be planned and developed as they would make an enormous contribution to alleviating traffic problems.  People from Dublin and other towns and cities are tired of sitting in traffic jams.  We should look at developing an efficient rail service to places close to Dublin so that people can commute each day to their work.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with a letter I received recently from the chief executive of Iarnród Éireann, who is a Kilkenny man.  He pointed out that a commuter service is not planned from Kilkenny to Dublin in the near future.  I call on the Minister to intervene so that the necessary infrastructure is provided for a commuter service from Kilkenny to Dublin as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am glad the report highlighted the problems recognised by those of us who use the rail network on a regular basis between Cherryville junction and Kilkenny.  I was not surprised to read about the difficulties in the service.  We must spend a large amount of money on our rail network to avoid human tragedy.  We should increase the money provided for level crossings. Many level crossings on the Kilkenny to Waterford route, particularly at Knockmoylan, are still not automated.  This must be rectified, particularly in view of the number of accidents and near misses there in recent years.</P>
      <P>I welcome this timely report which focuses our minds on the safety of the rail system and on the fact that it has been a Cinderella service in terms of public transport for far too long.  It will make an enormous contribution to planning and development and will help to provide a better service for the people.  We should implement the findings of this report as soon as possible so that a human tragedy is avoided.  We must provide a good and efficient public transport service so that people will not be as frustrated as they are at present.</P>

      <P>In times of ever increasing road traffic, demands for extra space on the roads and traffic jams which we experience on a daily basis, it is appropriate that we turn our attention to the rail system.  For a long time it has been ignored as an alternative to road traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency in Kildare where rail safety has attracted a great deal of attention in recent times.  I am glad the report has been published because it will ensure that immediate action is taken to address these issues.  If that does not happen, I am afraid there may be a serious <Col N="1272" /> catastrophe.  The potential for a serious accident increases with each passing day.  Something must be done to prevent this.  I hope the Minister provides the necessary funds in the near future rather than in the long term.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to introduce a properly resourced strategy to tackle educational disadvantage and learning difficulties, which are a source of inequality at all levels of our education &mdash; pre-school, primary, secondary, third level, and further education &mdash; and which, despite their devastating <Col N="1273" /> impact on many young lives, are only addressed by a series of under resourced and ad hoc measures with very limited impact, and condemns the Minister for Education for not honouring commitments to the electorate in this respect.</P>
    <P>This is one of the most important debates we will have in the Dáil this year.  Educational disadvantage lies at the heart of poverty and marginalisation in our community. As technology advances, marginalisation becomes more acute.  Tackling it at its source must be the national priority as we approach the new millennium.  It is also an opportune time to take stock of what the Government is doing to tackle educational disadvantage.  We have seen two books of Estimates from the Minister's hand.</P>
    <P>No one can understate the extent of our educational disadvantage problem.  Even a cursory glance at some of the indicators collected, many by international agencies rather than agencies within the Department, illustrate that point.  One in five abandons school before sitting his or her leaving certificate.  Reading scores at age 14 place Ireland in the bottom fifth of OECD countries. One in six school leavers cannot carry out even basic reading tasks.  This was illustrated by the international adult literacy survey which found that one in six of those aged 16 to 25 is unable to read the back of an aspirin package.  Those are some of the children who are the products of our so-called education revolution, but our education system is failing many of those young people at an early age.  It is particularly disturbing that literacy problems of this sort are three times more prevalent in deprived urban areas and affect three times as many boys as girls.</P>
    <P>There are 33,000 pupils of school going age with a disability and approximately two thirds are in mainstream schools where a significant proportion of them receive little or no support beyond the classroom teacher.  This is an area in respect of which the Department does not collect information.  The last survey to which the Minister can point dates back five years to 1993 when we found that almost 60 per cent of those with a disability in ordinary classes had no support beyond the classroom teacher.  That was a shocking figure.  The position has improved somewhat but not significantly in the intervening period, but the extent of the improvement cannot be documented by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A total of 80 per cent of traveller children abandon school at the age of 12.  A total of 10 per cent of children are affected by regular absence from school and that figure rises to 25 per cent in deprived urban areas.  One in four children is regularly absent from schools in many parts of our city.  More could be added to this chronicle of indicators of educational disadvantage.  The Minister and the Department seem to have a policy of &ldquo;see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil&rdquo; in relation to this problem.  Despite the national anti-poverty strategy with its emphasis on educational <Col N="1274" /> disadvantage, the Minister has not arranged to gather any systematic information about many of the issues on which the Department sets specific targets.  He does not collect regular information from schools about literacy and numeracy or about truancy and suspensions from schools, even though he has a legal obligation to do so.  He also does not collect information about the special needs of children with disabilities and special learning needs which require appropriate resources.  He must answer that he does not know the position in relation to those children.  He does not collect systematic information about the level of adult illiteracy, another key target of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>The Minister when in Opposition said he would introduce a five year strategy to tackle educational disadvantage.  That was one of his priorities. He repeated that not only in public statements, but gave that solemn commitment to some of the teachers' unions.  Specific targets were set by the national anti-poverty strategy in this area, but because information on this area is not collected we do not know if we are making any progress in this regard.  Information is power, it commands attention and where it is not collected performance is clouded and accountability is blunted.  It seems the Department and the Minister are happy to allow that position to continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have failed to devote adequate resources to the problems of educational disadvantage and we can see evidence of that all around us.  An education in welfare service has not been developed for most of the 50,000 primary school children who have regular school attendance problems.  There are school attendants for only five out of six pupils nationally in a certain limited number of urban areas that are not comprehensive in terms of the city of Dublin where large swathes of disadvantaged areas are outside the attention of school attendants.  Recommendations have been put forward since 1970 to the effect that this matter should be taken out of the hands of the Garda, but this has not been acted on.</P>
    <P>One in three children who need remedial education do not get it.  A total of 91 schools designated as disadvantaged or breaking the cycle schools, many of which are in the most deprived parts of the country, have lost a teacher this year due to marginal declines in pupil numbers. Breaking the Cycle, which is reaching only 1.5 per cent of the pupil population, has not been expanded by the Minister.  Fewer than one in ten adults with literacy problems are receiving adult education and literacy programmes continue to be run on a shoestring.  None of the 14 young people who abandon school before sitting their leaving certificate obtains any guidance or counselling service.  The pattern of educational disadvantage becomes established at pre-school and primary level.  Presumably that was why the Government declared solemnly in its programme for Government that primary education would receive priority, but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> In this year's Estimates an increase of £170 million in current spending was made available to the education sector, but how much of this went to the primary sector?  Was it 80 per cent?  Would that reflect it being given priority?  Was it 60 per cent, reflecting that more than half of pupils in this country are at primary level?  No, it got a mere 20 per cent of additional resources in terms of staffing and it was given only 24 per cent of the allocation in respect of capital spending, and the Minister heralded that as a revolution.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will seek to defend himself by repeating once again that £1 million per year over three years will be devoted to an early school leaver initiative, but he will not refer to the fact that this scheme received seven times more applications than were approved and would have needed £17 million to satisfy the genuine needs embraced by proposals put forward by the community and the educationalists across the country. These projects would have helped more than 11,000 potential early school leavers, but they were turned away.  It is difficult to see how the Minister can gel that with his declared priority to address educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>People rightly ask how it was so easy to find £250 million for a technology initiative, but so little to address basic educational needs.  The Minister must understand that people are frustrated with the hollow promises he gave before the last election.  At primary level alone every school was to have a remedial teacher, but we know that 704 do not have access to one.  Every one teacher school was to have a second teacher and every school was to have administrative and care-taking services as a basic necessity.  Staffing schedules were to be altered and based on a progressive reduction of class size.  The election manifesto went so far as to say that teachers would be retained in their schools even where there was a fall in numbers.  That was an unrealistic provision to include in their manifesto.  The Minister said that provision was wrongly interpreted and I will give him the benefit of the doubt in that regard.</P>
    <P>When have we seen teachers forced to take to the streets in industrial action not in pursuit of better conditions for their members but to highlight some of the problems at the root of educational disadvantage?  That is the sorry pass to which we have come and why this motion is so appropriate.  Since the Minister took office he has not assigned an extra teacher to the primary sector or to second level.  He is relying on the so-called demographic dividend, which is rapidly diminishing.  This year alone the demographic dividend was halved.  It decreased from 409 in 1997 to 189 this year and the pattern is continuing to decline.  Birth rates have risen and the Department's projections in respect of pupil numbers suggest the decline in the number of pupils will be fewer next year than this year.  In about three years' time the demographic dividend will have virtually disappeared.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> The Minister is in the dock.  He will protest that these problems are not all of his making and he is correct in that regard.  However, he has made no effort to address them and for that he is accountable.</P>
    <P>The education system is not levelling out life's opportunities in Ireland.  Compared to the children of top earners, children from low income families fare substantially worse at each of the significant stages in the education system.  When compared to their more well off counterparts, these children are 16 times more likely to leave school without sitting the leaving certificate examination, four times more likely to obtain insufficient points to gain entry to third level education and three times less likely to enter third level education, even if they attain sufficient points.  In effect, the education system is reinforcing, not eliminating, inequality in the community. We must face these hard realities.</P>
    <P>With regard to early school leavers, there is an unemployment rate of 61 per cent among those who leave without qualifications and a rate of 42 per cent among those who reach junior certificate level.  People with a disability who emerge from the education system ill equipped to cope, face an unemployment rate of 80 per cent.  Early school leavers are also vulnerable to slipping into a life of crime and substance abuse.  In the past two years there has been a 50 per cent increase in the number of children aged under 13 who become involved in crime.  It must be remembered that school attendance remains compulsory for children of that age.  We are fast approaching a situation where one in seven of our young people will be reported to the Garda for juvenile offences and they will be either prosecuted or cautioned. Among these young people are the hardened criminals of tomorrow.  The Minister has got his priorities wrong.  We must stop the rot and begin the task of reversing these trends in the education system.</P>
    <P>In recent days I hosted a conference which drew together many of those who deal with educational disadvantage in Leinster, particularly in the city of Dublin.  It was frightening to have to come to terms with the extent of the practical problems faced by the schools and communities those people represent.  In some areas children do not bother to attend school and they stay out until 2 a.m. collecting glasses in bars.  In other areas, approximately 50 per cent of enrolments come from non-Irish families.  These areas face a number of insuperable problems.</P>
    <P>I am aware that tackling the problem of educational disadvantage is not an easy road to take. It would be much easier for a Minister to set his standards by providing computers in classrooms or instituting easy resource tests.  The Minister has already had the opportunity to introduce two Estimates, but neither has reflected the commitment he made to bodies such as the INTO that a five year programme to tackle educational disadvantage would be put in place.  His action on the subject of educational disadvantage has been <Col N="1277" /> nothing but a sham.  For example, last year a tax relief for disadvantaged schools was introduced. Three people availed of it during the past year, which represents a total of £2,000 tax relief paid out under the scheme.  That is the sort of thing which frustrates those in the frontline who are trying to cope with educational problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister must face up to his responsibilities. Interestingly, the INTO has recalled a number of the statements he made in Opposition.  For example, he stated it was unacceptable that schools which experience extreme disadvantage in urban and rural areas have been denied an additional teacher or support under the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  He further stated that schools in so-called disadvantaged areas were being assisted by the increase in capitation grants but that those schools subsequently lost teachers. This year 91 such schools lost teachers which directly contradicts commitments made and views expressed by the Minister when in Opposition. He made similar statements about the remedial service.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Opposition he was on the right track.  However, something has gone wrong since he crossed the floor of the House. There are serious issues that affect all levels of education.  For example, at pre-school level the early start programme reaches only 1.5 per cent of children.  It is a sad reflection that most of the effort to tackle pre-school education does not even originate with the Department of Education and Science.  People who work on community employment schemes throughout the country are taking a much more innovative approach than the Department, the main provider of education, to helping pupils with difficulties.</P>
    <P>This is the basis on which the Minister stands in the dock.  He must change his approach because, unfortunately, time is running out.  He has already committed himself to introducing two Estimates which gave no priority to these sadly disadvantaged areas and young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent ESRI school leavers' survey shows that a father's occupation can largely determine a young person's chances of entering third level education.  Only 25 per cent of people from semi-skilled or unskilled backgrounds and 20 per cent from unemployed backgrounds attend university, but the national average attendance at third level is 37.5 per cent. Approximately one in five or 6,500 first year students drop out of college and do not register for second year courses.  These figures are approximate because statistics are not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why, at a time when we are enjoying an unprecedented economic boom and an increasing skills shortage, are so many young people dropping out of third level education?  Why, at a time when the vast majority of graduates are guaranteed jobs, are these people not completing their courses? One of the main reasons for these statistics lies with the paltry maintenance grants paid to third level students.  The maintenance grant works out <Col N="1278" /> at £45.88 per week.  If a person is unfortunate enough to be offered a third level place in Dublin, digs will cost him or her on average, £65 per week while a flat will cost £45 per week.  Rates charged for accommodation in many of the other towns and cities with third level institutions are not far below those charged in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Given the price increases in the private rented sector, students are forced to use their entire maintenance grants to cover rent expenses. Students from low income backgrounds are being discriminated against at a time when the State should be encouraging their participation in third level education.  The entire grant scheme must be radically overhauled.  Grants must be increased in line with the cost of living and income limits must be raised.  I urge the Minister to introduce an annual assessment for the cost of accommodation and other student costs prior to the decision on the structure of the maintenance grant for the following year.</P>
    <P>The difficulties faced by students in obtaining accommodation are a direct result of the Government's response to the Bacon report.  Like other low income groups, students must compete for accommodation with the private rented sector. An adequate supply of habitable and affordable accommodation does not exist at present.  The irony of the Government's position is that while it boasts about the provision of additional college places this year it has in no way addressed the accommodation needs of students who hope to fill those places.  Direct intervention is urgently required to provide students with viable housing options.  I urge the Government to consider introducing a scheme where elderly people would be entitled to take in students on fixed rents without affecting their pension entitlements.  Such a scheme would help to meet the need for additional accommodation while providing a valuable social service to the elderly and students alike.</P>
    <P>While the number of on-campus accommodation facilities in Ireland is dwarfed into insignificance when compared to other EU countries, a massive programme of building must take place in the third level sector.  Schemes of this sort should be developed with a combination of private and public sector funding.</P>
    <P>The increasing financial pressures on students come at a time when various reports have assessed the cost of living of those who move away from home to attend college at between £4,500 and £5,500.  This is placing huge pressure on many families, with parents being obliged to take on additional jobs or work long hours of overtime to try to make ends meet.  It is also adding to the pressures on students in college who work part-time jobs to finance their education. These students must ensure they do not have to repeat a year because some of them could not afford to do so due to the expense involved. These issues are also related to the problem of suicide and attempted suicide among third level students, some of whom cannot find any other <Col N="1279" /> way out of the fight to find the money to allow them to stay in college while also ensuring they pass their examinations.</P>
    <P>The much heralded back to education allowance has become a bureaucratic nightmare.  It was introduced to encourage unemployed people to return to the education system.  However, without an adequate up-front payment, many of these people cannot afford to pay deposits for their accommodation.  The situation whereby applicants are not informed whether they will be approved for the scheme until they have registered is like buying a pig in a poke.  This type of ambivalence on the part of the Department is discouraging many potential applicants from applying for the scheme.  The introduction of an up-front payment from within the maintenance grant and the BTEA would help with certain up-front costs faced by students, particularly those from low income backgrounds who cannot afford to pay deposits on accommodation in Dublin or to pay for books, etc.  The current quota system for the VTOS scheme is another example of bureaucracy gone mad.  Ten per cent of places are held for single parents.  However, if a single parent has not been unemployed for at least six months when this quota is being filled, he or she will not get a place on the scheme and it will continue, with vacancies, even though funding is provided. These are the people we should be encouraging back into the education system.  We must develop a coherent, alternative entry system to third level education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds and expand the scheme run by the partnership companies which provide funding for flexible support for third level students to cover expenses, such as, travel, books and examination fees.  The Minister must break down barriers to entry to third level education, not create new ones.  The only way to break the cycle of poverty and tackle disadvantage is through the provision of adequate funding to ensure every student has equal access to all levels of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I commend my colleague for putting down this motion.  I wish to speak on special education provision and the services available to children with special needs.  In the short time available to me I will not be able to do a comprehensive trawl through the sector, but I hope to highlight a few issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times many parents of children with special needs have sought to have their children educated in mainstream schools, particularly primary schools.  This is their entitlement by virtue of Article 42 of our Constitution, and this right is enforced in the education Bill recently approved by this House.  The Minister has failed to deliver in this important area.  We still have the humiliating experience of parents having to take the Minister and his Department to court to have those services put in place.  Despite what is contained <Col N="1280" /> in the Constitution and in the recent Bill, the Minister continues to challenge parents to bring him to court.  That is unacceptable and the Minister must hang his head in shame because he is still authorising his Department to contest these cases and force parents into the courts.</P>
    <P>There is no blueprint for parents, for teachers or for boards of management on the services, resources and materials that are available to enable a student with special needs to attend a mainstream school.  Recently in my constituency a child who is confined to a wheelchair arrived at school in September.  There were some small provisions put in place but, even at this stage, as we head into the middle of November, all the facilities are still not in place for that child.  The ramp into the school has only just been completed. Toilet facilities have only just been completed. The school is still not meeting the special educational needs of that child.  I commend the Secretary General of the Department who, when I contacted his office quite recently, pulled out all the stops to ensure the service would be delivered and delivered quickly.  It is not good enough that each parent has to reinvent the wheel every time a child with special needs is presented at school. We need to have a blueprint whereby a handbook will be available from the Department indicating to parents, teachers, principals and boards of management what is available from the Department of Education and Science and from the Department of Health and Children.  It is not right that people should have to go through the humiliation of ringing the Department to be pushed from one Department to another and fail to get proper answers.  This is something which has to be rectified by the Minister and his Department. The Minister's approach of forcing parents to have recourse to the courts to achieve a basic level of education for their children is outrageous and must be abandoned.</P>
    <P>The availability of classroom assistants in schools where there are children with special needs is fundamental to the integration of these students into mainstream schools.  While I welcome the Minister's announcement in this regard, I await the improvement at school level and will hence reserve my position in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The treatment of children with dyslexia is something we need to treat very seriously.  Dyslexia associations operate on a voluntary basis around the country.  They provide, at not inconsiderable cost to themselves, additional tuition for the children.  They organise weekend seminars for teachers to teach their children in a special way. This, unfortunately, is unresourced by the Department.  It is an area where parents are left doing something on their own.  Even where those children have been psychologically assessed and are found to have particular and specific learning difficulties, the Department does not respond to it.  This is shameful.  The Department's acknowledgement of this condition is very weak and I am disappointed that services and concessions previously available in relation to examinations seem <Col N="1281" /> to have been gradually eroded and withdrawn by the Department.  What help is it to such a student to inform the examiner of his or her disability?  I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister today asking what services are specifically available in examinations for children with dyslexia. The whole thrust of the Minister's response was that the examiner will be informed that the child has a special difficulty.  The Minister himself was a teacher.  He knows, having operated in classrooms for quite a number of years as I did, that very often children can go unnoticed in the classroom.  How then can he expect an examiner to know a child has particular difficulties.  Will there be a label on his or her script to say the child is dyslexic?</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of what the Minister is saying is that he will ensure all the work presented will be looked at and marked even if the writing is not very good and so on.  That is not good enough.  The major difficulty of some children with dyslexia is that they have difficulty reading the paper, they have difficulty reading it correctly and as efficiently as other children.  That is where their problems lie.  They have difficulty doing the work within the timeframe allowed and the Minister seems to have withdrawn the additional time that might be available to some of those children. They cannot complete a question within the same timeframe as the other children, yet the Minister does not seem able to give them the additional time that is necessary.  Is it fair that they are not going to have that extra time and hence get a fair assessment of their education and ability to cope with the examination?  That is something the Minister must review very carefully.</P>
    <P>It was brought to my attention recently that a child who had multiple disabilities, who was wheelchair bound and who had movement only from the neck up was awarded an additional ten minutes to complete the papers in the leaving certificate examination.  It seems outrageous that a student with such difficulties should be given such an inconsiderate timeframe in which to complete an examination and display to the Department and to the world at large that he or she has abilities, is able to cope with learning and with the leaving certificate examination.  Yet the Minister seems to be cutting them off at an early stage and not helping them in any way.</P>
    <P>I would like to have spent some of my time talking about the difficulties of children with autism.  Autistic children are in a very special category. The Department of Education and Science has recognised the disorder and I commend the Minister for it.  Autistic children do not look any different from others in general.  Many of them display normal tendencies at times and have great difficulties at other times.  We have to address that problem very sensitively and carefully.  Only recently, again in my constituency, I was made aware of the expulsion of an autistic child from a school because the school simply could not cope with him.  It needed three adults to look after the child each day and there were no additional <Col N="1282" /> resources at the school to help with the child.  The school had no option but to expel him.  Regretfully, that child is now in residential accommodation and possibly will remain there.  If the additional resources were available to the school he was attending, the long-term prognosis for him would have been better.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address this whole area of special education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton on bringing forward this very important issue.</P>
      <P>The extent of educational disadvantage in Ireland is alarming.  Each year 14,000 students, or 21 per cent of the cohort, leave school without attempting the leaving certificate examination.  In disadvantaged urban areas the position is twice as bad.  Only 5 per cent of pupils from such areas will go on to third level education compared to a national figure of 45 per cent.</P>
      <P>Despite the concentration of disadvantage in urban black spots, 60 per cent of children who are educationally disadvantaged are in rural areas or small towns.  A recent survey showed that 25 per cent of Irish adults are at the lowest level of literacy. This incidence is 50 per cent higher than the average of other advanced countries surveyed. Those results are serious and alarming and there is a big responsibility on everyone involved in education to change that.</P>
      <P>Addressing educational disadvantage is central in tackling poverty and social exclusion.  Educational disadvantage curtails the life, chances and choices of adults and young people and contributes to an intergenerational cycle of poverty and social exclusion.  In addition, it limits access and participation in the labour market and curtails personal and social development.</P>
      <P>There is a growing awareness of the complex factors which give rise to educational disadvantage and a recognition of the need to address it in an integrated way.  The focus should be on preventative initiatives which seek to retain young people in the educational system and on initiatives which provide support and progression routes to young people who leave school early.</P>
      <P>The national development plan should provide for a continuation of local development programmes with a strong focus on addressing educational disadvantage.  Child care can play an important role in addressing educational disadvantage and good quality child care has an educational dimension which can make an important contribution to the development of pre-primary education infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special measures which should be considered are: the further development of integrated responses, for instance, to support the involvement of parents as partners in education; the further development of home-school community link; the expansion of pre-school provision, particularly in the community and the voluntary sector in disadvantaged communities; the support and encouragement of models of good practice to target and support disadvantaged students in <Col N="1283" /> non-designated areas of disadvantage which are quite considerable and addressing continual high levels of adult literacy by supporting second chance education opportunities and lifelong learning.</P>
    <P>Building and developing co-operation between business and education is critical.  There are a great number of people in the educational system who can contribute to business.  This should be looked at given skills shortages.  Interventions should also be supported to help reduce the number of young people who experience problems in this area.  The equal participation of members of the travelling community and of people with disabilities in the educational system should be encouraged.  Flexible and innovative programmes must be used to help school leavers and early school leavers get real job opportunities.  The expansion of support services, for example, guidance counselling and home liaison for potential and actual school leavers, is also important.</P>
    <P>It is disturbing and disheartening that there are still 200,000 pupils in classes of 30 or more pupils. Eighty per cent of principals must combine their full-time teaching responsibilities with administrative duties.  This is a major price to pay.  More than 500 schools are still without access to remedial teachers, which is frightening.  The pupil-teacher ratio for special classes set out in the special education review committee report has not been fully implemented.  Due to a major shortage of substitute teachers, each day thousands of pupils are in the care of unqualified and untrained personnel.  Forty two per cent of substitute hours were provided by untrained personnel in 1997.</P>
    <P>It is frightening that 8,000 children with special needs are attending mainstream schools on an integrated basis without minimal support services. The most recent allocation of remedial teachers includes 13 clusters comprising four schools, 8 clusters comprising five schools, ten clusters comprising six schools and two clusters comprising seven schools.  With clusters of this size it is impossible to provide the quality of individual attention which children attending remedial classes require.  This is the biggest issue of all.</P>
    <P>Half of the State's full-time students attend primary school.  However, only a quarter of the funding goes to primary level.  Primary school authorities are required by regulation to pay a local contribution before they receive their annual grant.  This is not a requirement for postprimary schools or third level institutions despite the fact that the Constitution guarantees free primary education for every child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's motion. A number of pertinent facts have come to light, even at this early stage of the debate.  The bright and shining light which entered the Department of Education and Science has visibly dimmed, either because the Minister is running into a <Col N="1284" /> bureaucratic wall or because the promises which he made prior to election are unrecognisable and unreachable.</P>
      <P>The Constitution guarantees equality and fairness to each child.  Yesterday a teacher approached me about a six year old with multiple problems &mdash; physical and mental disability and visual impairment.  This child's parents want to enrol him or her in a normal school next year. The teacher called all the relevant agencies together and all of them are unable to provide facilities and resources to cater for this child's problems.</P>
      <P>I received three replies to parliamentary questions about remedial teachers from the Minister today.  The first related to Attymass national school, Ballina, and assured me that the needs of Attymass national school will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations.  The second related to St. Peter's national school, Snugboro, Castlebar and assured me that the needs of St. Peter's national school will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations.  The third related to Attymass, Bofield, Bonniconlon and Carrow schools and assured me that the needs of all schools in that area will be considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations. In fairness to the Minister, they are replies.  However, they mean absolutely nothing.</P>
      <P>Three hundred and fifty pupils are needed to qualify for a remedial teacher, which means at least five or six schools.  The teacher's time travelling from school to school is taken from teaching time.  The business of setting up and getting children ready for tuition means that the area is disastrous. It does not deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>St. Anthony's and St. Brid's are special schools in Castlebar.  St. Anthony's is run by Mrs. Kavanagh who trained escorts to bring children to school on special buses &mdash; children who are agitated, autistic, blind or have behavioural problems and need to be harnessed in or have special mobility aids.  Some of these children are now being denied access to any education simply because the FÁS scheme, under which the trained escorts are operating, is coming to an end. The pilot scheme operated by the Department of Education and Science is not being extended to cater for a number of runs from all over the county for children who need special attention.</P>
      <P>The bus driver told me that one child sitting in the passenger seat took off his shoe and threw it on the road.  It is likely that he has to be restrained because of his agitated nature.  When these children arrive at their school without an escort, the teacher has to come out and physically lift children &mdash; some of whom weigh 12 and a half stone and have mobility aids &mdash; off the bus and out of special harnesses.  In some cases the teacher has to summon help from another teacher in the classroom, which leaves a class of impaired pupils unattended.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these escorts are cycling three or four miles to bus pick-up points to give their commendable <Col N="1285" /> service to the Department of Education and Science in the interests of caring for children.  They are doing so on a FÁS salary of £3,900 per year.  This is absolutely disgraceful.  I know the Minister will allocate funding in the budget.  I hope he will extend the trained escort service to priority areas who need it, as it cannot be done all over the country at once.  It will in some way deal with the constitutional requirement to give these children access to education which they richly deserve and about which their parents are so seriously concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made promises as regards one teacher schools prior to the election.  Ten of these are left in Mayo.  I know the Minister costed this when he was in Opposition, although it has been costed differently since he entered Government. I would like him to deal with this.  The pupil-teacher ratio cannot be achieved next year but the Minister can work on it.  Departmental equipment grants, under which schools could recoup 50 per cent of costs, are no longer in operation. They should be reintroduced.  It was a good and effective scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann notes that the 1999 Abridged Estimates show spending on first, second and third level education rising by 20 per cent, 19 per cent and 19 per cent respectively versus the 1997 allocation and that this figure includes the largest ever direct funding increase for primary schools, believes that this significant investment in education is of crucial economic and social importance to the country and supports efforts to target resources at those who experience educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having waited for a year and a half I welcome this first education debate initiated by the Opposition during this Dáil.  I do not know why it has taken it so long to table an education motion. Perhaps it thought the passage of time would erase the memory of its empty rhetoric, its freezing of school funding, its failure to address special needs, its inactivity and its introduction of Estimates which would have cut teacher numbers. Whatever the reason for its reluctance to use its own time to debate education, it has finally got around to giving three hours to the issue of educational disadvantage.  It is a pity that we do not have more time because the Government is willing and eager to compare records in this area with the parties that made up the last Government. We have implemented more improvements and honoured more commitments than the last Government.  We have replaced inaction with <Col N="1286" /> innovation and a commitment which will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>There is no more important challenge facing society than that of making the education system more inclusive.  The many initiatives I have launched and will launch in the near future will implement a soundly-based approach at all levels. I have no interest in knee-jerk schemes which sound good but which waste limited resources and undermine our ability to make a real difference.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton admitted yesterday, the holding of this debate has little to do with a wish to have an informed discussion on serious issues, rather the Opposition believes that it can use this as a wedge issue to undermine the Government. A similar tactic was used last week when the Opposition sought to condemn a record on spending on disability services which dwarfs its own.  Shameless self-righteousness characterised many of the contributions and a number of Deputies have nothing to be proud of in their behaviour after the debate.  The almost intimidatory tactics used demonstrated clearly that the Opposition would not let the facts get in the way of its desperation to regain power.  I am not naive enough to expect the Opposition to be genuinely constructive but its latest tactics represent new levels of brazenness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no intention of letting the Opposition away with this.  It had its chance.  Its record is there for all to see and it failed to address any of the substantive issues about which it has worked itself into a state of false indignation.</P>
      <P>According to the motion Deputy Bruton believes the Government and I are to be condemned for our performance on educational disadvantage at all levels during the past five years. I am happy to accept the invitation to compare records point by point.</P>
      <P>One of the novel tactics used by the Opposition during the past week has been the crass misrepresentation of the Estimates volume published by the Minister for Finance.  On the day Deputy Noonan attacked the Government for spending too much money the Opposition attacked it for abiding by the health spending controls it introduced. Deputy Bruton is now using the same tactic in relation to the education Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimates for 1999, as published, show that education spending will be more than £500 million higher than the 1997 post-budget figure provided for by the Opposition when setting priorities. Deputy Bruton has ingeniously sought to twist the 1999 figures to suggest that the primary sector will receive less than other sectors.  He is either forgetting or choosing to ignore technical <Col N="1287" /> adjustments which I explained to the House previously and which mean that second and third level increases are slightly inflated.  These adjustments, which introduce fortnightly pay for secondary teachers and ensure third level grants are paid on time, represent discernible service improvements which were ignored for too long. The effect has been to inflate the 1997 outturn, deflate this year's outturn and make next year's increase for these sectors look higher than the primary sector increase.</P>
    <P>If one makes a reasonable two year comparison, one will see that primary sector spending will be 20 per cent higher next year than the amount provided by the Opposition in 1997.  This compares with increases of 19 per cent at second and third level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  The Minister is making it up as he goes along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Allowing for declining enrolments at primary level, this represents a major advance in funding.  Next year will see the largest ever increase in direct funding for primary schools.  In only two years I will have increased direct funding for primary schools by more than one third. When additional new payments relating to infant classes and science equipment are included the figure is even higher.</P>
      <P>Let us compare this record which Deputy Bruton wishes to condemn with that of the Government of which he was a member.  In the 1997 budget it had its chance to show what its priorities were.  A Government comprised of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left, with a Labour Minister for Finance and Minister for Education, decided to freeze all capitation payments. Its record on teaching resources was even worse. The 1997 post-budget Estimates included an unprecedented proposal to cut teacher numbers at primary level.  This proposal was laid aside only when it was staring down the barrel of an imminent general election.  It fell to me to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to pay for the abandonment of these cuts.  In light of this the House will forgive me if I disregard the Opposition's crocodile tears about school staffing.</P>
      <P>A remedial service should be available to all pupils who need one.  It is unacceptable that so many schools have no service.  The Government will face the electorate having addressed this issue comprehensively.  I made a start last year by allocating additional teachers and there will be further significant improvements next year.</P>
      <P>The home-school liaison scheme introduced by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, makes an important contribution to the work of disadvantaged schools.  That is why I allocated extra staff to this area from last September.  It is my goal to ensure every disadvantaged school benefits from this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The teacher-counsellor model can also make a major contribution.  The teacher-counsellor role is <Col N="1288" /> to co-ordinate a whole-school approach to disruptive behaviour and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit persistent behavioural difficulties.  I appointed extra teacher-counsellors last year and I am examining the further expansion of the scheme, including whether the model could be applied at second level.</P>
    <P>Educational disadvantage is not an exclusively urban phenomenon, it can be particularly acute in isolated rural areas.  It is widely accepted that teaching all years in one class places all students at a disadvantage and that the smallest schools need additional help.  While the Opposition's policy in government was to ignore this issue, we have made two reductions in the staffing schedule for the smallest and most isolated schools and will fully implement our promises in office.</P>
    <P>Even though historically, children with disabilities have been the most disadvantaged when it comes to the provision of an appropriate and responsive education, the Opposition has failed to mention them in the motion.  This is understandable in light of its shameful record of inaction. The Government has introduced a radical initiative which gives children with special needs, particularly children with autism, the automatic right to the supports they need to benefit from education.  Costing about £4 million next year, this initiative is particularly important in establishing the automatic right to child care assistance to help with toileting and mobility among other matters.  The policy I inherited from the last Government not only refused these automatic entitlements but involved fighting a case &mdash; the O'Donoghue case &mdash; all the way to the Supreme Court to deny these entitlements.</P>

      <P>My initiative will remove the need for parents of children with autism or others affected by the initiative to have recourse to the law to have their rights vindicated.  It is normal for justices to keep cases under review until new arrangements are bedded down.  On the morning of 10 November, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness addressed court No. 7 and informed it that she wished to make a statement.  The report sent to me said she expressed her thanks <Col N="1289" /> to the Minister for Education and Science for his courtesy in making available to her his press statement on children with special needs prior to being made public.  She had read the statement carefully and wished to express her admiration for the policies expressed therein.  She congratulated the Minister on this significant move announced recently.  The House will forgive me if I place more importance on this type of informed comment than the shallow, self-serving and shameless posturing of Deputy Richard Bruton on this issue.</P>
      <P>Another category of cases before the courts that relate to young offenders remains of major concern to me.  I have visited the various facilities under my Department's control and must say that, at least in one instance, the conditions were scandalous.  The Opposition may have been willing to stand over this situation when it was in power, but this Government will not do so. Redevelopment funding for these facilities has been increased in the Estimates by more than 300 per cent and I have also significantly increased current funding.  The Government has no intention of neglecting this group of disadvantaged young people in the manner of the previous one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kenny spoke of the need for escorts on buses for children with disabilities.  What was he doing in the last Government?  This situation has existed for years.  There have been no escorts on school buses for children with disabilities for five years.  The Deputies opposite, especially those who were in Government, have some nerve to posture on the matter in the House when they did absolutely nothing about it when they had the chance.  I will do something about it shortly to ensure such children have escorts on buses in future.</P>
      <P>Another scandalous situation which I encountered on coming into Government was that the previous Government was forcing all special schools to come up with 15 per cent of the funding for any capital project.  I changed that within two to three months of coming into office and ensured they had to come up with only 5 per cent. We will be changing that again and will announce further developments on that front shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud to have made a priority of ensuring there is an educational psychological service to identify and intervene where various needs manifest themselves.  Since taking office, I have appointed additional psychologists and put in place a blueprint for a national educational psychological agency.  The various staffing improvements I have mentioned have focused on addressing educational disadvantage and have been warmly welcomed by the schools concerned. On a number of occasions it has been falsely presented that I reduced staffing for disadvantaged schools.  I want to nail this.  Apart from the targeted improvements which I outlined, the staffing arrangements for all disadvantaged schools are fully in accordance with those agreed by the last Government.  While I hope to improve <Col N="1290" /> on these arrangements, if the Opposition wants to attack them, it must admit it put them in place.</P>
    <P>An accusation has been made by some concerning the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  The core staffing schedule of 15:1 for infant classes is being fully and absolutely adhered to.  I have no doubt some Deputies will ignore this and keep peddling their line but it is simply untrue.  On the wider issue of this pilot project, it is providing very valuable learning and I pay tribute to the coordinator of the project, whose energy and commitment are the most important elements of what I believe will be its success.  That said, I hope there can be a sense of proportion on the scale of the project.  I have no doubt we will hear some inflated rhetoric from the Labour Party, but it should not be forgotten that it covers only 35 urban schools.  It was not expanded by the Labour Party in 1997 when it had the chance, and it involves the expenditure of only £700,000 above existing resources already within the system.  If one compares this with the huge level of funding allocated to third level fees by the same party, one can see where its priorities lay.</P>
    <P>The quality of education children receive is often affected by the quality of the building in which they are taught.  There was a serious backlog of even basic remedial work which had been left unaddressed by the time the Government took up office.  We have doubled spending on school building and renovation and next year more than £117 million will be spent in this area. There will be a discernible improvement in the quality of the learning environment for many of our school pupils, and I also intend to ensure disadvantaged schools are better enabled to benefit from State funding for projects.</P>
    <P>When I launched the Government's technology for schools plan, I said we were determined not to reinforce inequality through unequal access to information communication technologies.  We have been true to this.  All schools have benefited from direct funding and we have been developing ways of using ICTs to improve and expand education in disadvantaged areas.  Some of these projects are already drawing international attention, and over the coming months I will be in a position to announce a range of new initiatives.  In comparison, the only funding available from the last Government was for computer trolleys rather than computers.</P>
    <P>The travelling community has traditionally been one of the most educationally disadvantaged groups in this country.  Since my appointment, I have sought to work with members of the travelling community to develop our policies in this area.  As well as expanding provision in traveller education centres, I assumed responsibility for senior traveller training centres.  I have also established an advisory committee on traveller education, which includes members from a range of organisations, including those representing the travelling community.  I am fully committed to ensuring we have a comprehensive and integrated policy on extending educational opportunity to <Col N="1291" /> all travellers and providing the necessary resources to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that one of the great divides in Irish society is between those who have completed a senior cycle education and those who left school early.  Some 63 per cent of unemployed people have no leaving certificate and three quarters of poor households are headed by a person with no educational qualifications.  These factors cannot be ignored and that is why I have given them such prominence since my appointment.  It was only after I started addressing this issue that the Opposition began to show an interest in it. The policy before my appointment complacently assumed we were effortlessly moving towards the goal of having 90 per cent of students complete the senior cycle.  Within a few months of my appointment I pointed out that retention figures suggested at best a levelling at roughly 80 per cent.  I established a group to carry out the first proper quantitative and qualitative analysis of the areas where retention rates are low, and I will shortly be in a position to act on the results of this research process.  The curriculum provided by schools can play an important part in helping a child to stay in school.  Significant extra funding is in place to ensure the curriculum diversity needed to provide the most appropriate programmes for each student.  This will make a definite impact on retention.</P>
    <P>The payment of examination fees by poorer families was presented to me as badly affecting them.  As a result I abolished these fees for all families who qualify for a medical card.  Forgetting that his Government did nothing about this issue, the only response from Deputy Bruton was that I should get rid of them for all students.  This reflects the general policy he has adopted to my announcements &mdash; calling for a doubling of everything, even where he previously ignored the issue. This was almost comical last November on the day when the Government announced the largest single investment in education in the history of the State.  Deputy Bruton's response to the Education Technology Investment Fund was that it should be £750 million rather than £250 million. What was especially remarkable about this was that it was only a matter of months since he had sat in a Cabinet which failed to provide funds for the problems being addressed.</P>
    <P>Although Deputy Bruton now dismisses the initiative we announced to target early school leaving in the age group eight to 15, this is the first time any Government has addressed the problem.  It also involves a level of funding greater than that allocated to other pilot projects which the Opposition spends so much time lauding.  The roughly 3,000 students each year who fit into this category must be a priority and I am determined to isolate the most effective policies and expand them to all areas which would benefit from them.  An essential part of this is to develop a system for tracking students who are in danger of drifting out of the <Col N="1292" /> education system and intervening at the right stage.  The failure of the last Government to provide such a system has been a serious impediment to tackling attendance problems, but the issue has been identified and is being addressed.  This tracking system will be one of the most important outcomes from the initiative and will provide invaluable assistance to the new Education and Welfare Board which the Government will establish next year.  The board will be a centre piece of the new school attendance legislation currently with the parliamentary draftsman.  The legislation will move away from the ineffective enforcementonly approach the previous Government was wedded to and will implement a more integrated and child-centred policy.  Education welfare officers will liaise with schools, parents, the Garda and the children to ensure attendance problems are either prevented or isolated and quickly addressed.</P>
    <P>I accept Deputy Bruton is sincere in wanting to tackle the issue of early school leaving, but I cannot accept that spending millions on providing teenagers with a small wage to stay in school or the introduction of discredited and divisive league tables would achieve anything positive.  In all, the multi-layered and innovative policies we have developed represent a more credible response.</P>
    <P>It is also important to provide second-chance interventions for those who leave school early. Because of the importance we place on this area, the first decision of this Government on education was to expand Youthreach provision and improve the service available to participants.  This highly effective programme, initiated by Fianna Fáil when previously in Government, has been directly responsible for helping thousands of young people get back into education or employment.</P>
    <P>Not only did we create 1,000 extra places, we also provided an additional £1 million to strengthen counselling, guidance and psychological services for participants.  A total of £2 million has been provided to expand bridging and progression options and almost £3 million has been provided for child care services for both Youthreach and VTOS.  I challenge any party in the House to match this level of commitment to helping this educationally disadvantaged group.</P>
    <P>Because of the importance I place on second-chance and adult education, I established the Education Access Support Service earlier this year which is helping in the co-ordination and planning of these services.</P>
    <P>We have been clear that we intend to tackle the high level of literacy problems among our adult population.  As a start, we doubled targeted adult literacy funding to £4 million this year.  We will go further than this and reinforce another record of helping the educationally disadvantaged which no party in the House can challenge.  This will be particularly demonstrated in the Green Paper on Adult Education which we will launch later this week. <Col N="1293" /> The post-leaving certificate sector has been dynamic and effective in expanding educational opportunity to more and more groups.  We recognise this and we have already created more than 4,000 additional post-leaving certificate places.  In addition, we have introduced a maintenance grant scheme for post-leaving certificate students which will cost more than £15 million per year.</P>

      <P>Having studiously ignored this sector when in Government, the Opposition's only response has been to carp at inevitable administrative difficulties in implementing a complex new scheme.  In addition to this funding, we have provided the first ever dedicated capital budget for post-leaving certificate colleges.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly said that flexible routes of progression within further and higher education are essential to building inclusion.  This will form one of the central elements in the qualifications Bill which I will publish in the coming months. However, I have already supported the development of a new NCEA foundation course specifically targeted at people who previously did not have access to educational opportunities.</P>
      <P>I have also greatly increased the number of places available to students wanting to follow apprenticeships.  Thousands of new places are giving people, who might not benefit from the traditional academic routes, the opportunity to have a high quality training and obtain well paid employment. A total of 5,600 apprenticeship places have been provided in less than 15 months.</P>
      <P>At third level, we have expanded opportunity through creating more than 8,000 extra places. Funding for disadvantaged access is more than £800,000 and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce a significant development in this area.</P>
      <P>The technological sector has been a driving force behind expanding opportunity at third level. It offers a range of flexible options directed specifically at key strategic needs.  This Government has a record of investing in its development unmatched by any party, particularly in the context of the technology investment fund which will invest more than £100 million in the infrastructure of those colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An essential element of third level is the need to broaden access, especially through non-traditional routes of entry.  I remind the House of the national certificate in manufacturing technology which I launched last January.  Through this initiative, people are given places on courses which involve a heavy degree of work placement. The level of attrition from the course is very small and the employment opportunities are almost guaranteed.  A total of 300 people started on the <Col N="1294" /> course in January and we have had more than 2,000 applications for a further 500 places on a course which will commence next January.  This is educational disadvantage being challenged in a targeted, effective and lasting way.</P>
    <P>Through a task force I established, a highly innovative summer programme in technology training was implemented this year, and 45 per cent of the participants were unemployed.  We also announced the establishment of Blanchardstown Institute of Technology, with a capital investment of more than £20 million and a targeted enrolment figure of 30 per cent non-standard entrants.  This is a significant initiative in terms of tackling access to third level education in an area which has had the lowest participation in third level of any other in the country.</P>
    <P>The contrast between this range of targeted and effective policies and the record of the previous Government is dramatic.  It had its priorities and while educational disadvantage featured high in the speeches, it simply did not rate when it came to action.  Everything was put into an untargeted abolition of fees which has not helped a single child from an area of significant disadvantage to go to college.  Costing more than £70 million this year, the abolition of fees put the brakes on improvements in nearly every other area of education.  I realise the abolition has relieved pressure on many middle income families who found it difficult to pay the fees, and I do not intend to reintroduce them.</P>

      <P>The Opposition, and the Labour Party in particular, should have the good grace to admit this was their only significant priority.</P>
      <P>I was struck by the promise made by the Leader of the Labour Party to a student demonstration last week to implement their shopping list of demands costing more than £100 million per year.  He went as far as promising to abolish a registration fee which his party had introduced. I also cannot take seriously the attacks on me, supposedly on grounds of concern for the disadvantaged, for implementing an already envisaged increase in a charge not paid by 50 per cent of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The message is clear; as far as the Labour Party is concerned, other areas of education can wait.  It has no intention of adopting a policy of genuinely targeting disadvantage.  Perhaps its Members, in their contributions, when they finish praising themselves for pilot initiatives costing an additional sum total of £1.5 million per year, could explain how it is that, as a result of a budget prepared under the direction of their leader and with the concurrence of a Cabinet which included <Col N="1295" /> Deputy Bruton, they were willing to vote in favour of Estimates which froze school funding, cut primary teacher numbers, refused automatic supports to many children with disabilities and maintained exam charges for the poorest families.</P>
    <P>They might also usefully explain why the establishment of a series of regional quangos costing £40 million should have been a priority while, at the same time, they spent £250,000 denying the educational rights of a child with severe disabilities. Unfortunately, I do not expect that any of these questions will be answered.  While they have never been noted for self-criticism, we will inevitably hear again the epic case of auto-revisionism which is allowing the Opposition to ignore its many failures in Government.</P>
    <P>When the bluster and self-congratulation is stripped away, the Opposition has a record of consummate failure when it comes to tackling educational disadvantage.  It is clear that the Opposition recognises the success of this Government in setting the agenda on education and in putting educational disadvantage at the heart of public policy debate.  In most areas, the first time the Opposition gets around to even talking about issues is in response to a Government initiative. Its agenda, which has been reactive and negative, has failed to make a constructive contribution.</P>
    <P>My condemnation of the record of the previous Government is not something which its opponents alone hold to.  I would direct members of the Opposition to the comments of the leader of the previous Government on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme of 24 July when he admitted they had signally failed to prioritise educational disadvantage and investment in primary education.</P>
    <P>In comparison, we can point to action through the largest ever increase in direct primary funding, the first ever automatic support for many children with disabilities, a new approach to traveller education, a doubling in school building and renovation funding, the guarantee of equal access to information technologies, the expansion of curriculum diversity at second level, the creation of an educational psychology service, the integration of drop-out initiatives across first and second levels, the abolition of exam fees for the poorest families, the development of a radical new approach to attendance problems, the implementation of a major expansion in early school leaver services, together with counselling and child care facilities, the doubling of adult literacy funding, the introduction of grants for post-leaving certificate students, the expansion of places at both further and higher education, the introduction of new third level courses targeted at excluded groups and so on.</P>
    <P>Ours is a wide-ranging and determined commitment to expanding educational opportunity which dwarfs that shown by the Opposition in its <Col N="1296" /> time in Government.  Having waited for a year and a half, the first education topic raised in Private Member's time has, unfortunately, been motivated again by short-term considerations.  I have no difficulty rejecting the condemnations in the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Moynihan-Cronin.  Tá athás orm an seans a fháil chun labhairt sa díospóireacht seo anocht. Over recent years the terminology of social science has gained currency in political discourse. We now speak about social exclusion and social disadvantage.  These terms are common currency and all parties and Deputies use this terminology. However, it is important at times to bring to mind the reality that lies behind our language.  Social exclusion and social disadvantage are other terms for poverty.  It is the poverty that was present in my youth, that has forced generations of young people to emigrate and that has ensured that social divisions continue to this day.</P>
      <P>When seeking to comprehensively deal with a problem like educational disadvantage and learning difficulties, a structured inclusive approach is required.  In solving any problem the first step is to clearly identify and quantify that which needs to be remedied.  Then there must follow a full assessment of the available resources which are being, or can be, brought to bear in achieving a resolution.</P>
      <P>Having clearly defined the objective and assessed available means to realising that objective, the first step is to ensure optimum utilisation. When there are many elements to the solution co-ordination and streamlining are paramount.  Equally important are careful monitoring and accountability.</P>
      <P>These general points may seem like stating the obvious but against the background of the provision of the Department of Education and Science for educational disadvantage and learning difficulties they need not only to be stated but to be re-emphasised.  This is not to suggest that schools or the Department of Education and Science can come anywhere near providing what is needed without an integrated approach involving other Government Departments, local authorities and State agencies.  The focus at pre-school, first and second levels must be a family one.  This focus can be and often is necessary into third level and second chance education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first concerted effort to target disadvantaged children to ensure that they got the necessary support and resources was made by the former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, in the last Administration.  The &ldquo;Early Start&rdquo; and &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; programmes were innovative measures that sought to redress the gross inequality that has bedevilled our society for decades. These programmes have been welcomed by all partners in education.  The expansion and <Col N="1297" /> enhancement of these programmes is essential if our assault on educational disadvantage is to continue.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the expansion of these programmes has not been a priority for this Government. At a time of unprecedented economic growth we are presented with an unrivalled opportunity to invest in the future of our children and of communities that have struggled against economic and social deprivation for decades. However, to date, the record of this Government and its plans for the huge Exchequer surplus, do not seem to have taken account of this fact.</P>
    <P>Early intervention, individual plans and regular review and adaptation are essential ingredients of the needed provision in effectively combating educational disadvantage and dealing with learning difficulties.  This must be underpinned by a holistic approach centred on the family and a co-ordination of family support services.</P>
    <P>In terms of family support services, education welfare officers can play a key role.  Where parents, for instance, through dereliction of responsibility or neglect are failing their children then, in the interests of those children, they must be assisted in discharging in a fit and proper way their responsibilities as parents.  Education welfare officers must have a statutory role and in order that that role may be maximised in terms of effectiveness, statutory powers to co-ordinate the services of the various Government Departments, local authorities and statutory agencies must be provided.  Effectively, the education welfare officers would have a clearly defined statutory role and, more importantly, statutory powers.</P>
    <P>The final responsibility would rest with the education welfare officer to see that individual education plans were implemented, that a holistic approach would be brought to bear on the needs of the individual child, which could include education for the parents in terms of parenting, and any other supports and interventions which would be required to make the fullest provision for the child.</P>
    <P>Referral to the education welfare officer could not be made too early and could come from development clinics, medical practitioners, social workers or any other health professionals, the probation service, the Garda, teacher or any competent person.</P>
    <P>If pupils are poorly prepared when they enter the formal school system, a major opportunity has not alone been lost but the prospect of making good that loss to any sustainable degree is remote.  This underlines the necessity for early diagnosis and early intervention.  Most sensory, physical or intellectual disabilities are identifiable, if not at birth, at an early stage of the child's development.  The special needs that arise from social or environmental factors are also predictable, <Col N="1298" /> if not from the very beginning, then also at an early stage of development.</P>
    <P>When children with special education needs have been identified and their needs comprehensively assessed, it is absolutely vital that appropriate individual plans are developed for each child but also that an effective monitoring procedure is put in place so that the possibility of these children, at any stage, falling out of the education system is effectively removed.</P>
    <P>A key service in ensuring that children are identified at an early stage in the education system lies with the schools psychological service. The Minister has expanded this service since he came into office.  However, the fact that, as we approach the end of the 20th century, this State does not have a nationwide psychological service for our primary schools is nothing short of a disgrace.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports this motion.  We cannot accept that when the coffers of the State are awash with money, a Government can ignore those communities that have suffered the most hardship and disadvantage.  If we do not tackle this problem now we may live with the consequences of the Government's failure for decades to come.  Now is the time to act and this message must be heard loud and clear, not only in the Minister's office in Marlborough Street but more importantly in the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy's, office in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go back over the past and I hope my comments will be seen as constructive. I disagree with Government policy, although I recognise that in his own way the Minister is seeking to deal with the problem of disadvantage.  However, I have long held the belief that the problem of educational disadvantage is not one which a single Minister can address effectively.  This matter is one for the Government to address.  The Government now has the greatest opportunity in terms of resources to address the problem.  There may be turf wars in bringing forward the type of agenda that I have suggested.  Nonetheless, that should not daunt anybody and it certainly should not daunt the Government in moving towards a resolution that can bring real change and improvements in the areas I have outlined.</P>
    <P>There is one point which involves a certain cost factor but it would not be enormous.  Teacher training should include a substantial module on disadvantage and disability.  No teacher should leave a college of education without a very good grounding in the means of addressing this matter. Those who are teaching at second and third levels should also have a basic qualification in these areas.  Some people may not like this.  They may see it as an extra burden but if we are to bring real equality to our society and our education system, providers of education should have the understanding needed to give the optimum service <Col N="1299" /> to disabled people.  The Minister must urgently address this matter.</P>
    <P>I have always taken a deep interest in second chance education, as has the Labour Party.  Quite a number of students go to third level technology colleges with very low leaving certificate grades and undertake courses which they have very little chance of completing.  When young people drop out of the system they are very seldom picked up and given a second chance at education.  I welcome the initiative announced by the Minister this year to introduce grants to students on PLC courses although I do not agree with capping those grants.  The PLC sector has tremendous potential for growth and for contributing to those suffering disadvantage.  People should be moved through the PLC system back to formal education.</P>
    <P>Many of those involved in community employment schemes work in caring occupations, caring for the disabled or the elderly.  Many people who take CES courses attain a high level of competence but they receive no formal qualification. The Minister should institute an education component to CES courses so that the level of competence achieved by participants in caring and other areas can be recognised in an educational attainment.  The Minister should put a structure in place which could lead people back into the education system.</P>
    <P>Politicians of various parties are fond of listing the achievements and failures of various Governments. However, we are all agreed that a large and growing problem exists and it is incumbent on the Oireachtas and particularly on the Government to address it.  Unless the approach to solving the problem is structured to include various Departments and local authorities, and people within the system are made responsible and accountable, the problem will remain unsolved for many years.</P>

      <P>Educational disadvantage is one of the most important features of the poverty cycle.  It has been proved beyond doubt that early intervention in a child's life can prevent him or her from being unemployed in later years. The Labour Party in Government recognised the importance of education in the formative years of a child's life by introducing the Early Start Programme. Unfortunately, this work has not been continued by the Government.  There are schools in very disadvantaged areas in which the number of teachers was reduced last September even though they were earmarked under the Breaking the Cycle Programme.  These cut-backs display a lack of interest by the Government in tackling educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During her tenure as Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach increased the number of teachers in many disadvantaged schools as part of the Breaking the Cycle Programme.  It is inconsiderate <Col N="1300" /> and appalling that her work has not been continued by the Government and is even being reversed.  When the Breaking the Cycle Programme was introduced very clear ground rules were laid down concerning the allocation of teachers.  It was agreed that the allocation under the programme would not be altered throughout the five year pilot scheme.  The cut back in teacher numbers in a number of disadvantaged schools is a gross interference by the Government and reflects a lack of interest in tackling the educational needs of those living in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>Any movement to reduce teacher numbers in disadvantaged schools is in breach of the national anti-poverty strategy to which the Government has declared its commitment.  The national anti-poverty strategy includes a commitment to reduce early school leaving and to tackle educational disadvantage. In reaching these objectives the national anti-poverty strategy identified pre-school education, the Breaking the Cycle initiative and special needs education as the keys to ensuring the maximum participation in our education system.  The Government's decision to cut back on the number of teachers in schools which were earmarked under the Breaking the Cycle Programme represents a breach of the commitments made in the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>Of those who left school in 1995, a staggering 18 per cent had no qualification beyond the junior certificate.  The majority of these students came from areas which had high levels of poverty and disadvantage.  Others in this group experienced learning difficulties at their schools but left because the education system did not cater for their needs.  This staggering rate of early school leaving will not be resolved until we reach a point where children's needs at pre-school and primary school levels are catered for.</P>
    <P>Educational disadvantage can be compounded by the low level of literacy among parents.  Not only does this mean that parents cannot assist their children with homework but many are less effective at campaigning for additional teachers and resources in their areas.  For this reason, disadvantaged areas should be given fair treatment in the context of expenditure.</P>
    <P>Access to remedial teachers is vital in most schools.  Not all children start out in education at the same level and the longer learning difficulties are ignored the more disadvantaged children become.  In rural areas access to remedial teachers can be aggravated by the fact that an assigned teacher is allocated to a large area.  This is the case in my constituency and the result is that the teacher spends most of the working day travelling between schools instead of teaching. Sparsely populated rural areas experience other educational disadvantage in the provision of educational services for children with special needs, including physical or mental handicap. <Col N="1301" /> It is impossible to eliminate educational disadvantage in one or two budgets but the reduction in the teacher numbers in schools in the Breaking the Cycle Programme sends all the wrong signals to parents and children who are trapped in poverty.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  I have raised this issue as a result of ongoing representations from constituents about the quality of Dublin Bus services and because of the experience of one constituent last week.  This individual uses the No. 77 bus to travel from his home in Drimnagh to work in Tallaght.  On 12 November, he telephoned me in a state of annoyance because of his experiences that morning.  He arrived at the bus stop on the Crumlin Road at 8.10 a.m. but did not get a bus until 9.27 a.m., one hour and 17 minutes later. One bus passed at 8.40 a.m. but it was full.  Everyone would agree that this type of service is not acceptable.  The Minister will also agree that such a service is an incentive for people to use their cars.  Unfortunately my constituent is not lucky enough to own a car.</P>
      <P>There is a need to think strategically about public transport in Dublin.  We need to plan and invest and we need action.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement that extra buses will be provided.  However, Dublin Bus needs more than a once-off investment from public transport initiatives.</P>
      <P>At about 4 per cent, public transport in Dublin is the least subsidised of any European capital. This must be compared with Brussels, Bonn and Amsterdam which have subsidy levels in excess of 60 per cent.  The system in Rome is subsidised by more than 80 per cent.  Bus users in Dublin are badly neglected.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus could introduce a number of useful initiatives.  For example, it could increase the number of outlets at which tickets are sold.  This is a simple measure and many shops would be glad of the extra business.  The company could also modernise the manner in which tickets are used.  In Italy it is possible to buy a packet of tickets which are used individually.  One puts the ticket into a machine which retains the ticket. This is less cumbersome than the system used in Dublin.  It would decrease the amount of time lost at bus stops and relieve the frustration of motorists caught behind buses.</P>

    <P>Dublin Bus badly needs to invest in new technology. In particular, it must invest in electronic noticeboards which could be installed at major <Col N="1302" /> bus stops.  Such signs would tell the public when the next bus is due.  It is very frustrating to read on the timetable that the next bus is due in a few minutes but one does not know if the bus has gone or when it will arrive.  Electronic noticeboards would indicate when the next bus is due or whether it is gone.  One could then reconsider one's options.  The service must be improved or else traffic will continue to dominate the political agenda.  It should not do so as we should have solved this problem.  It can be solved.  More investment is needed in the infrastructure of public transport and by way of subsidies or else I will have many more unfortunate constituents.</P>

      <P>I cannot reply to the specific matter raised by the Deputy as I cannot supervise the running times of every bus in Dublin and operational matters do not fall within my remit. However, I sympathise with his constituent.</P>
      <P>We need more buses and for the first time the Government is providing funding for 150 buses. This has not happened before and CIE had to pay for buses from its own revenues.  This is a major breakthrough.  The EU provided funding for 50 buses and the Government for 100 buses. This involves a direct payment of £25 million to Dublin Bus.  The company did not receive such payments from previous Governments.  I am not picking out the Deputy as he is a very pleasant person but it took some fighting to secure this investment.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there are seemingly small measures which could be effective if put into action.  He mentioned purchasing tickets at more outlets and electronic noticeboards such as those which operate on the DART.  However, the DART does not encounter traffic problems. A bus may be due in ten minutes according to an electronic sign but it may be caught in traffic.  This is where quality bus corridors come into play. There will be 12 such corridors.  The Lucan corridor is already operational and is working well. The service is regular and one overtakes out cars when one travels on the corridor &mdash; that is the real test.  The Malahide corridor is almost ready and I would appeal to those who are holding up the implementation of these corridors through the planning process to allow the plans proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Night Link service will be operational for Christmas.  This year it will also run from St. Stephen's Green as there were complaints that no services ran from that part of the city last year. There will also be two park and ride facilities at Whitehall and the RDS.  I was on the Cork park and ride service but I did not make an exhibition of myself and have my photograph appear in every newspaper.  I got on the bus but I did not make a show of myself like some others who got on a bus and got off after two stops.  The alert driver said he would give all the passengers a free <Col N="1303" /> ticket as the Minister for Transport was on the bus.  I thought that might be regarded as electioneering. Park and ride facilities are very effective.</P>
    <P>The Government has also provided funding for much needed, additional DART carriages.  I thought one could get these carriages as soon as they were ordered but this is not the case.  There is a lead-in time and it takes some time before delivery is made.  Deputy Upton is correct and his concerns are shared across the board.  He tabled this matter last week but I was not able to attend. However, I am glad he persisted.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of suburban lines.  This year, Operation Freeflow, which commences on Monday week, will operate in suburban areas and this will be helpful.</P>
    <P>John Prescott, the UK Minister for Transport, recently told me the Thatcher Government privatised the entire transport sector but that as a result costs have gone up and the service has declined.  The initiative did not succeed, to the extent that Mr. Prescott is considering some renationalisation.  He told me he tears his hair out every night &mdash; whatever hair he has left &mdash; in frustration with public transport.  It is an issue on which everybody must concentrate.  I appreciate the Deputy raising it on the Adjournment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter.</P>
      <P>The Department of Defence owns approximately 6,850 acres in the Glen of Imaal, County Wicklow.  The land is used as a major training area for tactical training for the Defence Forces. However, it is primarily used as an artillery range and it is the only such range in the State.  The range was used by the British army in preparation for the First World War.</P>
      <P>The range is located at an area of great natural beauty leading to the slopes of Lugnaquilla.  Its environs are heavily used by hill walkers and casual visitors.  While much progress has been made in the development of munitions, it is reasonable to assume that many unexploded shells lie in the general range area.  These are often buried on impact and over a period of time are brought to the surface.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 April 1978, a youth received superficial injuries when he apparently set fire to a furze bush on land adjacent to the Department of Defence property and a rifle bullet exploded.  On 1 September 1978, an accident occurred when four children were injured in an explosion.  On 14 April 1979, following the explosion of an unexploded shell, three children were killed and ten others injured.  As a result the then Minister for Defence established a committee to examine safety measures at the Glen and to make recommendations <Col N="1304" /> as to any further safety precautions which might be deemed necessary to minimise danger to the public arising from the use of Department lands at the Glen as a training ground for the firing of weapons.  The committee completed its deliberations in mid-1979.</P>
    <P>The main recommendations included the establishment of a range safety unit, the erection of appropriate warning signs and the fencing off of dangerous locations.  These recommendations have been implemented.  Procedures were introduced to alert the public to the inherent dangers on the firing range and to allow, within certain limits, the continuous use of the Glen by the public for recreational purposes.  However, it is still not unusual for hill walkers to stray onto the range area.</P>
    <P>In 1982, a special staff of military police personnel was established for the purpose of providing a warden service for the training area in the Glen of Imaal.  The numerical establishment approved for the warden service at that time was 17 non-commissioned personnel.  Since then no accident has occurred as any non-authorised individuals who stray onto the range area are quickly removed.  However, due to the general scaling down of the Defence Forces, the number of military police personnel engaged in the service on 1 November 1998 has dramatically decreased to six non-commissioned personnel.</P>
    <P>More hill walkers and visitors than ever now use the area.  The Cairns report, commissioned by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in 1995 to examine the concept of a Wicklow Mountains national park, through error or otherwise, included part of the military lands in the proposed park.  On a recent visit to the county, the present Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, spoke of establishing a council for the Wicklow Mountains national park.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence may argue that the warden service will be supplemented from other areas.  This is not satisfactory.  The success of the service has been due to the fact that the personnel have only one role and, as a result, are focused and committed.  This cannot be the case if the service is watered down.  I urge the Minister to increase the number of personnel in the service from the present number of six to the originally recommended number of 17.  I take no satisfaction in reviving unpleasant memories for the many people who suffered as a result of various accidents at the Glen of Imaal, but it is important to highlight that what might be a cutback could cost dearly.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Timmins for providing me with this opportunity to address the House on the question of the military range warden service in the Glen of Imaal. <Col N="1305" /> The State lands in the Glen of Imaal are vested in the Minister for Finance and comprise an area of about 8,000 acres within a perimeter of 20 miles.  The area is much frequented by tourists, hikers, daytrippers and so forth.  While most members of the public confine themselves to walking on the public roads and tracks, it is inevitable that some persons want to, and do, leave the roads and tracks and travel across open country.  The design and location of warning notices is kept under constant review to protect members of the public.</P>
      <P>In 1982, a special staff of military police personnel was established for the purpose of providing a warden service for the training area in the Glen of Imaal.  The service includes mobile patrols, warnings of dangers and other measures necessary to ensure the safety of members of the public using the area.  Coolmoney Camp, from which control and co-ordination of all activities in the area is exercised, is in the Glen.  The overall administration of effective safety measures in the area is the responsibility of the camp commandant of Coolmoney Camp.</P>
      <P>The Army component of the Permanent Defence Force was reorganised on 1 November 1998, in accordance with the recommendations of the Defence Forces review implementation plan which was approved by Government in March 1996.  The range warden service was, at its initiation, staffed with military police personnel but, as a result of the reorganisation on 1 November 1998, it has been decided that line personnel should now staff this service.  The military police personnel who were range wardens prior to the reorganisation were give the option of remaining in Coolmoney Camp as line range wardens and all of them accepted this option.</P>
      <P>The establishment for the range warden service in the Glen of Imaal is seven and the current strength is six.  I am advised by the military authorities that they consider this number sufficient, but the structure will be kept under constant review.  During periods of major activity in the Glen of Imaal, the range warden service will be augmented by personnel from the Defence Forces training centre, as deemed necessary by the military authorities to ensure the safety of the public and members of the Defence Forces is not put at unnecessary risk.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Timmins for providing me with the opportunity to address this matter this evening.  I will take account of the views he expressed and keep the matter under constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, has shown great interest in this issue and has been working on it for some <Col N="1306" /> time.  However, the problem lies not with the Department of Health and Children but with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Phase two of Mayo General Hospital is now a long running saga.  In May 1994, the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, established a project team. In July 1995, as Minister I announced approval for 33 beds for the orthopaedic services.  In February 1996, the brief was approved by the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, when he visited the hospital.  He agreed at that time to establish the CT scan facility and in June 1996 the design team was appointed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In November 1997, the planning process was completed and the board advertised for contractors and sub-contractors for inclusion in the list of tenderers.  In February, the board was ready to invite tenders but it was not approved by the Minister, Deputy Cowen, until May 1998 when he visited the hospital.  The Minister promised that work would be well under way before the end of this year.  August 1998 was the closing date for the receipt of tenders and in September 1998 the recommendation for acceptance of tenders was sent to the Minister.  Three months later approval is still awaited.</P>
      <P>Nobody would wish that an internal audit required by University College Hospital, Galway, should mean a delay in the provision of beds in phase two of Mayo General Hospital.  Can the Minister of State explain the reason for a delay of almost one year from the time tenders were ready to be invited in February 1998 and the acceptance of the recommended tender by the Minister?  A capital allocation of £2 million for this project was made in 1998.  Will this money be unspent, given the current situation in the Department?  I am anxious to receive a Government commitment that there will be no delay, other than what is necessary, before this project commences.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the delay is not in the Department of Health and Children, but in the Department of Finance.  That is because of the running cost envisaged for the hospital, the vast majority of which is associated with the orthopaedic unit which is much needed.  This phase two facility will provide decent hospital facilities for the people of County Mayo well into the next century.  It is long awaited following the provision of phase one.  I await Minister Moffatt's reply with interest.  I hope there will be no further delay and that work will commence before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity afforded to me this evening by Deputy Kenny to bring the House up to date on the current position in relation to the phase II capital development at Mayo General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, in May of this year my colleague, the Minister, formally conveyed <Col N="1307" /> approval to the Western Health Board to invite tenders for the appointment of a contractor and sub-contractors for this major development at an estimated construction cost of £22 million. The process of inviting tenders is an involved one which requires strict adherence with the relevant EU legislation.  Having completed this process, the health board, as awarding authority, formally sought the approval of the Department of Health and Children to the acceptance of tenders for the phase two development, as recommended by the project design team, in September last.</P>
    <P>This application for approval has since been under careful evaluation in my Department and the Minister is currently awaiting the completion of this process.  The Deputy will appreciate the fundamental importance of this process of detailed evaluation where an investment of public funding on the scale involved in this is project is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the strong commitment of this Government to the achievement of regional self-sufficiency within health board regions in the delivery of acute hospital services, through the provision of strong networks of regional and local general hospitals.  The planned development for Mayo General Hospital is a key component of this overall strategy.</P>
    <P>Taken together with the major £40 million phase two development under way at University College Hospital, Galway, and the significant developments at Portiuncula Hospital, Galway, and Roscommon County Hospital, the planned Mayo development is an essential element of the concrete manner in which this Government is acting out its commitment to the development of hospital services in the west.</P>
    <P>This approach to structuring the delivery of hospital services is consistent with the principle of equity that underlies the national health strategy. As the Minister has said on previous occasions, a system which requires people to travel to Dublin for services which could and should be available to them within their own region is not one which equitably serves their needs.</P>
    <P>These major hospital investments, under way and in planning, in the western region will transform the capacity of the hospital services there to meet the needs of the people to the enormous benefit of all.  This has been made possible by the decision of this Government to significantly increase the level of capital investment in the health services over that provided under the previous Administration.  The capital programme secured by my colleague, Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for the next two years amounts to £155 million in 1999 and £165 million in 2000.</P>
    <P>From my experience as a local public representative, I am acutely conscious of the important role of Mayo General Hospital in the social fabric <Col N="1308" /> of the county.  I am also well aware of the health and social needs of the population there that arises from the particular geographic and demographic factors pertaining.  I am particularly aware of the need for orthopaedic services.</P>
    <P>This awareness has shaped my own strongly held conviction that the major phase II development being planned for Mayo General Hospital is essential to the proper addressing of the health and social needs of the Mayo people through the provision of a range and quality of services which have been long required.</P>
    <P>I am proud, in my time in Government, to have been associated with the significant progress which has been made on the planning of this major development to this point.  Upon completion of the necessary evaluation process being undertaken, I look forward, with Deputy Kenny, to the ultimate fruition of this detailed planning work which has been well flagged in the recent Health Estimates, to which he referred.</P>
    <P>The minor temporary problems at the Regional Hospital Galway will not have any adverse effect in regard to Mayo General Hospital.  I assure the Deputy that any moneys in the general health service will be used up this year.  There will be nothing left over.  In fact, there will be a need for a Supplementary Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of the 16 gardeners who are on the street outside the Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, Dublin.  They are now in their fifth week on the street.  They are not on strike but suspended from duty without justification.  At a time of social partnership, about which we hear a great deal, it is a disgrace that the staff have been left out in the cold and rain for five weeks without any effort being made to bring the dispute to a conclusion.  The staff are available to perform normal duties prior to the introduction of a new system of training and examining of the Teagasc trainees.  Management made an offer which the staff rejected.  The staff quickly put forward an alternative suggestion to solve the difficulties but they did not get an opportunity to press their revised offer around the table.  Management suspended the gardeners. Why does the Minister feel the union claim is not worthy of discussion?  That is the only way to solve the matter.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the request by the union and staff will not cost more money.  Money is not really the issue.  It is a case of jigging around the regraded positions which have been offered by management.  The dispute concerns the different positions of the grades.  The staff are seeking conditions similar to those achieved by local authority gardeners with whom they are linked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The craft gardeners remain willing to negotiate a settlement to this dispute on terms which will <Col N="1309" /> be both more acceptable to them and less costly on the taxpayer.  Management remains opposed to such a solution or negotiations.</P>
    <P>Tonight I hope the Minister can indicate some movement from the Department's position. These are reasonable, mature, committed, dedicated workers.  They are not in any sense hotheads. Everyone is aware that suspending men and hoping they will crawl back after five weeks is not an option.  One cannot just expect men to stay out in cold wet weather like today and offer them no hope.  My view is that such carry-on leads to long-term bitterness.  The danger is that it will lead to an all-out picket, matters will get worse and bitterness will increase.  I ask the Minister to indicate that his Department will adopt a reasonable approach in this matter and get down to negotiations.  Sooner or later that is what will happen and that is where compromise will have to be reached.</P>
    <P>It would be better if the gardeners were allowed return to work on the terms which existed before, a time limit of two, three or four weeks imposed and matters sorted out.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister prepared to instruct his officials to adopt a more reasonable stance?  Is he prepared to get these men off the street and around the table?  Sooner or later negotiations must take place irrespective of the venue, be it at the Labour Court or in the Department's offices.  I hope the Minister can indicate some movement tonight.  Leaving the gardeners out in cold, wet, miserable weather is not an option.  It leads to more frustration and bitterness.  I hope the Minister has some good news.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Unfortunately, the Minister cannot be present tonight as she is in Brussels at a meeting of cultural Ministers.  As a consequence, it falls to me, as Minister of State, to reply to the Deputy.  The National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin are managed by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department.  Craft gardeners employed in the Botanic Gardens have, for some time, sought a universal upgrading.  This claim was rejected by the Labour Court on two previous occasions, in 1992 and again in 1996.  In pursuing this claim the gardeners' union, SIPTU, is seeking to overturn the findings of the court.  In the circumstances, my Department is not in a position to concede their demands.</P>
      <P>In furtherance of their claim, the gardeners refused to co-operate with training assessments for student gardeners.  Having regard to this refusal to carry out duties proper to their position, management were regrettably left with no alternative but to suspend the gardeners from duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> Teagasc has a long established training facility at the Botanic Gardens.  Its student gardeners undergo practical training elements of their amenity horticulture diploma course in the gardens.  The Department's gardeners have traditionally completed the job assessments of the students for Teagasc. Obviously the Botanic Gardens are in a unique position to provide specialist training.  In 1994, Teagasc decided to revise the system of assessment to a modular base.  This required a modest additional input from the gardeners, entirely in keeping with their craftsperson grading.  They refused to co-operate and used the situation to renew the grading claim, the concession of which would have given them greater status over other craftspersons including other gardeners, within the Department.  There would also be repercussions in so far as other Government Departments and local authority sectors are concerned.  The issue was again referred to the Labour Court in 1996, where the claim was rejected.</P>
    <P>There was further extensive negotiation and investigation of the matter, even following the last Labour Court recommendation.  A constructive and imaginative response was made in a genuine effort to bring matters to a conclusion.  The offer made was, by any standard, a very generous one.  Sadly, following a ballot of the union membership this approach was rejected out of hand.  The union's response was to effectively revert to the original demand, which as I have already said, could not be acceded to.</P>
    <P>At this juncture my Department could not countenance any further delay to the commencement of student training.  The gardeners were clearly advised of the consequences of their refusal to co-operate.</P>
    <P>Following the inevitable suspensions from duty, the union mounted a picket at the Botanic Gardens. However, the gardens have remained open to the public, although there has been some curtailment of the glasshouse openings.  All essential activities are being maintained and at present there is no danger to any plant species.  Contrary to comments in the media, management staff are perfectly competent and capable of maintaining all the rare, delicate and other plants.</P>
    <P>Since the Office of Public Works in 1992 and more recently my Department, took over responsibility for the National Botanic Gardens, enormous strides have been taken to restore them to their pre-eminent position.  The recent major capital investment in the Botanic Gardens has resulted in international acclaim for the superb restoration work to the Turner Curvilinear Glasshouse Range.  The Minister had the pleasure to unveil a plaque last October commemorating the prestigious Europa Nostra Award.  In the same month the Taoiseach opened the new Herbarium Library building.  Ambitious plans are in hand to restore other aspects of the gardens and to enhance visitor facilities there.</P>
    <P>In the context of all these positive measures that have been undertaken, or are planned, at the Botanic Gardens, it is a cause of great regret that there is an industrial dispute there.  My Department has already signalled its willingness to renew negotiations with the union on condition that normal working is resumed, including full co-operation with the student <Col N="1311" /> training programmes.  I earnestly hope this invitation will be taken up soon and that in turn it will lead to a resolution of the dispute.  This is the only practical way forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I will convey the deputy's views to the Minister on her return from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 November 1998. <Col N="1313" /></P>

So far, the Commission has indicated that it does not intend to bring forward proposals to reverse that decision, which has been enacted into European law.  Any such reversal would require unanimous agreement at Council.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House previously, at my specific request, the proposed abolition of duty free sales was placed on the agenda for the ECOFIN Council meeting on 19 May 1998.  While some member states were broadly supportive of my request, it was not possible to get the EU Commission to agree to undertake an EU wide study into the consequences of the abolition of duty free sales.  On 2 November 1998, I wrote to a number of my ECOFIN colleagues to say that, should the issue be raised again, we would appreciate their co-operation and assistance in handling it at Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the significant progress which has been made over recent months in stabilising international financial and capital markets, the economic and financial problems besetting many emerging economies continue to be a cause for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outlook for the world economy in 1999 is for weaker growth but I can find no convincing reasons arguing for a slide into recession.  Growth is likely to slacken in the OECD area from around 2.5 per cent in 1998 to about 1.75 per cent in 1999.  Growth in the world economy is likely to <Col N="1316" /> be anchored by the continued expansion of the European and the US economies albeit at more moderate rates.</P>
    <P>As I have said frequently over recent months, Ireland cannot expect to remain immune from the showdown in the world economy.  As a small highly open economy heavily dependent on inward investment, Ireland's economic performance is clearly strongly affected by international economic conditions, particularly those in the EU and US.  There will undoubetedly be a slow down in export growth.  Foreign investment into this country, which has been one of the main contributory factors to our remarkable economic growth over the 1990s is also likely to slow down.</P>
    <P>As far as the impact on EMU is concerned, the launch of monetary union will make a significant contribution to the restoration of international financial stability through the maintenance of internal policies within the euro area focused on the achievement of price stability and on the conduct of budgetary policies in accordance with the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The increased emphasis on co-ordination of EU economic policies in the context of the establishment of EMU will help maximise the contribution of the EU economy to economic stability generally.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware, the EU Commission introduced a proposal for the taxation of energy products in March 1997.  No agreement on the proposal has been reached by technical groups reporting to the ECOFIN Council.  Discussions on the broad thrust of the proposal have taken place at Council but no decisions have been reached.</P>
      <P>As I have stated previously in the House, it is necessary from an environmental viewpoint to examine these taxes constructively.  Nonetheless, while the imposition of a carbon tax &mdash; at either EU or domestic level &mdash; may influence both private and industrial consumers in their use of energy products, I would be concerned, as Minister for Finance, to ensure that any measure which is advanced to promote energy saving does not adversely affect Ireland's competitiveness.  I am also concerned about the effect the imposition of any such tax would have on the Consumer Price Index and how the tax would impact on the less well off members of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This commitment is being met by implementing the Report of the Review Group on the National Lottery published last year.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the group required it primarily to look closely at the impact of spending finance from the surplus of the national lottery with particular attention to the allocation of funds administered by Departments under discretionary schemes involving financial support for voluntary agencies such as sporting and community bodies.</P>
      <P>The group was also asked to review the arrangements and procedures for processing applications for national lottery funding and to make recommendations for maximum transparency in the allocation of lottery resources.</P>
      <P>Submissions were invited from individuals and interested parties by way of public advertisement. Approximately 130 submissions were made to the group from a wide range of interests throughout the community.  All submissions were considered by the group.</P>
      <P>The main recommendation of the group is that, in future, the allocation of lottery resources should be directed entirely to the support of voluntary and community activity.  A major step towards implementing this has been made in the 1999 Abridged Book of Estimates.  This is intended to bring about a much closer association, than has been the case heretofore, of lottery support with a wide range of services and activities at the heart of the community.  In this way, the benefits of spending on the lottery &mdash; about 33p of every pound spent on a lottery ticket goes to the good causes &mdash; could be more clearly demonstrated than under the present arrangements. The recommendation entails a realignment of lottery funded expenditure involving, on the one hand, the transfer to lottery funding of some support for voluntary and community bodies currently provided by the Exchequer and, on the other, the transfer to the Exchequer of support for statutory bodies now funded from the lottery.</P>
      <P>The greater emphasis on voluntary and community groups is one that I welcome.  I know that many of those involved in voluntary and community projects that have been aided by the lottery in the past have found that the assistance provided was the catalyst to enable some very important progress to be made in the provision of facilities or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will summarise for Deputies the other main principal recommendations of the review group. The allocation of national lottery funds should continue to be made by the Government rather than by an independent body.  The subsequent disbursement of lottery funds should be made in partnership with the voluntary and community <Col N="1318" /> sector.  The needs of the most disadvantaged groups within the voluntary and community sectors should be prioritised in the allocation of lottery funds within individual programmes and due regard should be had to gender and regional balance. Application procedures for support from programmes funded by the beneficiary fund should be standardised and means of access to them made more publicly visible.  The Government should from time to time publish more details of how the funding is distributed over various sectors.  Decision making on applications should reflect a commitment to the principle of partnership with the client base.  The National Lottery Act, 1986, should be amended to provide for the procedures which must be followed when national lottery funds are being allocated.  A process should be put in place to enable the Government to identify, from time to time, suitable major projects with an enduring impact which could be provided for from lottery resources.  To oversee the implementation of the recommendations made in the report and to maintain a continuous oversight of the disbursement of the beneficiary fund, a national lottery beneficiary fund monitoring committee should be established.</P>
    <P>As indicated earlier, one of the main recommendations, the transfer of funding between the Exchequer and the voluntary/community sectors, has largely been implemented and my Department, in consultation with the other Departments concerned, is implementing the other recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a small open economy, the inflation rate in Ireland is very heavily influenced by the level of inflation in our trading partners and by exchange rate movements.  The combination of this factor, the success of social partnership, and the increasing competition in the retail sector has meant that in the five years to end 1997 our inflation rate, at an average of 1.9 per cent, was consistently below European levels which averaged 2.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has correctly noted, inflation in Ireland in 1998 is above that of the EU.  In the year to September &mdash; the latest period for which EU comparable harmonised index of consumer prices figures are available &mdash; inflation in Ireland rose by 2.8 per cent as compared with 1.2 per cent for the EU as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upturn in CPI inflation in Ireland over the first half of this year largely reflects the strength of the currencies of our major trading partners and in particular sterling last year.  This gave rise <Col N="1319" /> to a temporary increase in inflation in Ireland as higher import prices fed through into the prices of exchange rate sensitive traded goods.  It is also likely to have impacted indirectly on non-traded goods and services prices in the economy reflecting the spillover from price increases in traded goods inputs.</P>
    <P>Subsequent movements in the effective &mdash; trade weighted &mdash; exchange rate is expected to alleviate upward pressure on prices.  My Department's most recent inflation forecast &mdash; published in <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> in July &mdash; was for an annual increase of 2.75 per cent in 1998 and an inflation rate of between 2 and 2.5 per cent in 1999 depending on the evolution of exchange rates.  More recent indications are that the 1998 outturn may be somewhat lower than forecasted in ERO and with the progressive unwinding of sterling strength inflation seems set to decline towards 2 per cent in 1999.</P>
    <P>I will, in the context of next month's budget on 2 December, be updating my forecast for inflation in 1998 and setting out a projection for the next three years.  The 1999 budget will have as one of its primary objectives &mdash; against the backdrop of Ireland's membership of EMU from 1 January next &mdash; the achievement of low inflation and the maintenance of Ireland's international competitiveness.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 56 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current number of entities on the Revenue records as holding tax exemption as charities is 6,380.  Many of the charities which are granted exemption are small voluntary organisations and some of them lapse over time.  Where, over the years, Revenue became aware that an entity granted exemption had ceased activity, it withdrew the exemption.  Early this year Revenue commenced a special project to identify all those charities granted exemption which are no longer in existence.  This project is still ongoing and so far it has identified over 1,000 defunct charities. <Col N="1320" /> The number of active tax exempt charities is believed by Revenue to be less than 5,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will be pleased to learn that the Revenue Commissioners intend to make public a list of charitable exempt bodies shortly.</P>
    <P>The role of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to charities is confined to consideration of applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from certain taxes on the basis that they are established for charitable purposes only and to operating controls and monitoring, commensurate with the risk to the Exchequer, to ensure that the exemption is not abused.</P>
    <P>In their approach to controls, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me of the following. Firstly, they recognise the important contribution which voluntary organisations make to Irish society and that monitoring controls should not unduly hinder the efforts of those involved. Secondly, the perceived Exchequer risk from entities granted tax exemption is generally low. The records maintained by the Revenue Commissioners indicate that the majority of these entities are small, many of them being local organisations operating on a voluntary basis.  The Costello report found that 75 per cent of charities had an annual income of less than £50,000.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that their records indicate that this is still the general picture.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they operate controls and monitoring on entities granted exemption, which take account of the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor Genearal in his 1992 annual report as well as the concerns of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners require each entity granted tax exemption as a charity to provide them with a copy of its first year's financial accounts, as well as details of activities actually carried out, within 18 months of the grant of exemption.  Bodies with income in excess of £20,000 per annum must submit audited accounts. Unless these requirements are met, exemption is liable to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>A long-term monitoring procedure has also been operated by Revenue since 1988 under which entities granted exemption are selected for review on a risk analysis basis.  In these reviews, Revenue addresses issues such as accumulated income and, where a charity is dissolved, the distribution of its assets.  Where DIRT-free accounts are operated, the entity holding exemption is obliged by law to furnish a prescribed declaration form to the relevant financial institution confirming its tax-exempt status.  The maintenance of such bank accounts, including details of accumulated income, are subject to examination by Revenue in the course of the review.  Over the past three years, Revenue have completed more than 500 long-term reviews of entities granted exemption and they advise me that the reviews disclosed a high standard of compliance with the terms of <Col N="1321" /> the exemption.  No cases of serious abuse or of Exchequer losses emerged from the reviews.</P>

      <P>On 20 October 1998 the Government agreed in principle to the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector at the earliest date possible, and agreed to the immediate establishment of an implementation group to progress the necessary work.</P>
      <P>The implementation group is to advise the Government on the following.  First, the role and functions of the single financial regulatory authority, that is, prudential supervision, the maintenance of orderly markets, safeguarding of clients' funds, consumer protection, the development and regulation of conduct of business rules, including consideration of the issues arising from combining the functions of monetary policy and prudential regulation.  Second, the range of financial service providers to be overseen by the authority, that is, banks, building societies, Post Office Savings Bank, insurance companies and brokers, investment intermediaries, including lawyers and accountants in as much as they handle clients' funds, exchanges, credit unions, friendly societies, finance companies, moneylenders etc., also taking account of the development of electronic commerce which may involve new types of service providers.  Third, the extent to which, if any, existing regulators, that is, the Director of Consumer Affairs, Registrar of Friendly Societies, Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, would continue to have functions in relation to the regulation of the financial services sector and the extent to which any alteration to the status quo would impinge on the nonregulatory functions of the Central Bank.  Fourth, the organisational structure for the authority including the manner of its public accountability. Fifth, the funding, resourcing and staffing of the authority &mdash; and issues arising in a transition to a new structure, including staffing and industrial relations, and the extent to which the authority could be self-financing.  Sixth, the legislative changes necessary for the establishment of the authority.  Seventh, the time schedule &mdash; including, in so far as necessary, a phased implementation &mdash; for achieving the objective of a fully operational single financial regulator at the earliest date possible.</P>
      <P>The implementation group, consisting of nine members in all under the Chairmanship of Michael McDowell SC, is to report jointly to the Tánaiste and to me by end February 1990.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the group continues to meet regularly, approximately every two months, to monitor developments and to review the effectiveness of measures taken to combat tax and social welfare fraud.  The membership of the group has been extended to include the Small Firms Association, so that particular concerns of the small business sector can be included in the group's deliberations.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs respond to the concerns raised in the group by carrying out investigations of the matters raised and, where there is evidence of black economy activity, taking appropriate action.  Where necessary, the question of amending the tax or social welfare codes would also be considered.  Also, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Community and Family Affairs keep members of the group informed of new initiatives to tackle the black economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has proved to be a useful forum for exchange of information on black economy activity.  Tangible results have been achieved in relation to the construction industry where the group made recommendations, since implemented, on the tightening up of the sub-contractor system.  The group continues to focus on concerns raised by IBEC and the SFA about social welfare fraud and the difficulties being experienced by employers in attracting persons in <Col N="1323" /> receipt of social welfare benefits to take up employment.  In this regard, the group was briefed, at its last meeting, by a representative of FÁS, regarding the work of that organisation. Areas covered included the Employment Action Plan recently launced by the Tánaiste, linkages between FÁS and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the experience of FÁS in liaising with employers.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the group has been instrumental in the formation of a working group comprising FÁS, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the CIF which is considering ways of dealing with the skills shortage in the construction industry.  In the light of concerns expressed by the group, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is taking ongoing action to ensure that only genuinely unemployed construction workers remain on the live register.</P>
    <P>The group was briefed on the special project undertaken by Revenue to ensure that the correct system of tax deduction is operated in respect of workers in the construction industry.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the group will be provided with a report of the outcome of the special project, at its next meeting. However, the point has been made in the group that the disputes in the industry concerning employment practices are primarily an industrial relations rather than a black economy issue.  I am informed that the Revenue Commissioners regard the issue as a black economy issue only in so far as employers incorrectly categorise workers as self-employed but that the Revenue cannot dictate the terms under which workers are engaged.</P>
    <P>The Black Economy Monitoring Group has a construction industry sub-group, which includes representatives of employers and unions in the industry as well as representatives of Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  This sub-group was set up specifically to deal with black economy issues relating to the construction industry.  Any member of the sub-group who feels that there are black economy issues relating to the industry which need to be brought to the attention of Revenue and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is free to call for a meeting of this sub-group.</P>

      <P>In my end-September commentary on the Exchequer Statement, I said that it was expected that there would be general Government surplus in 1998 of <Col N="1324" /> the order of 2 per cent of GDP.  In keeping with the commitment given at the time of the revaluation of the Irish pound in March, the surplus in 1998 will be used to reduce debt.</P>
      <P>With regard to the redemption of loans and financial instruments, it should be noted that current funding requirements, which take account of the combination of the budgetary surplus and maturing loans, are actively managed on a global basis, together with the stock of existing debt, with a view to achieving the most cost effective outcome possible over time.</P>
      <P>In the period from 1 January 1998 to 13 November 1998 loans or other financial instruments amounting to some £1.234 million were repaid.  A list of these instruments is attached.</P>

      <P>Works on the Mulcaire River Cappamore drainage scheme are in progress. The first phase of construction works being carried out by Coffey Construction Limited is scheduled to be completed by the end of this year.  Tenders are currently being invited for tree-felling and fencing contracts on the remainder of the scheme and these will be in place by mid-December this year.</P>
      <P>My officials are awaiting a draft programme for the completion of the works from the consulting engineers on the project, Messrs.  Fahy Fitzpatrick Limited.  This programme is expected in early December.  Because the flood relief scheme is subject to considerable environmental considerations certain works can only be carried out at particular times of the year.  It is envisaged that the remaining works will be carried out over a two-year period, finishing at the end of the year 2000.  The total approved budget for the scheme is £7.038 million.  When my officials have examined the draft programme, a detailed works schedule will be drawn up which will specify the works to be completed by direct labour and by contract.  This decision will be made early next year.</P>

      <Quest>the basis of the £8.8 million being paid annually over a 20 year period by Allied Irish Banks to the administration of Insurance Corporation of Ireland as referred to in Parliamentary Question No. 114 of 5 November 1998.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual contribution of £8.8 million over 20 years from AIB to the High Court administrator of Icarom plc &mdash; formerly Insurance Corporation of Ireland &mdash; is the amount provided for under the terms of an agreement entered into in December 1992 between the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and Allied Irish Banks.  Because of the large sums involved it was agreed that the necessary funding would be provided over a 20 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The AIB contribution was calculated on the basis that it would meet approximately half of the liabilities of the administration.  Under the 1992 funding arrangements the Exchequer provided an interest-free loan of £32 million and assumed responsibility for the £100 million loan which had been advanced to the administrator in 1985 and which is due to be repaid to the Exchequer in 2000.  At the time the 1992 funding arrangements were agreed it was not expected that the administrator would be in a position to meet the £100 million repayment from the resources available to him.  However, developments since 1992, including <Col N="1326" /> reduced interest rates and the settlement of the claim against the former ICI auditors, have resulted in a situation where the administrator is expected to be in a position to repay the £100 million loan from the resources currently available to him.  These developments do not affect the AIB contribution.  The administrator is also expected to be in a position to repay the Exchequer loan of £32 million.</P>
    <P>As I noted in my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question on 5 November 1998, the Exchequer share of the costs of the funding arrangements for the Icarom administration is estimated at 9 per cent and that this would be less if the Exchequer loan of £32 million were repaid earlier than the scheduled repayment date of 2012.  Therefore, the final cost to the Exchequer cannot be determined until the administration is completed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are participating in inter-departmental work on the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement, with particular reference to the establishment of North-South implementation bodies.  They are particularly involved in discussions, including with British colleagues, on so-called horizontal issues, such as funding, staffing, accounting and audit arrangements.</P>
      <P>In addition, if it were agreed to establish an EU programmes implementation body &mdash; this is one possibility listed in the Agreement &mdash; my Department would be directly involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department, in common with <Col N="1327" /> all other Departments, is currently considering which matters within its remit might be appropriate for priority attention by the North-South Ministerial Council, when established.  Participation in the Council will be an essential responsibility of Ministers North and South and I intend to play a full part in making sure that it fulfils its potential to develop consultation, co-operation and action on matters of mutual interest between ourselves and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to investment in the Border counties, it can be expected that the North-South institutions, operating in a context of lasting peace, will have a particularly positive inpact upon the Border counties.  In addition, the Border counties will, under the current round of Structural Funds, receive, in addition to mainstream funding, a total of approximately £200 million from the INTERREG programme and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Deputies may take heart from the Regional Affairs Commissioner Wulf-Matthies' statement recently that the Commission intend to significantly reinforce the INTERREG programme in the next round of structural funding.  Furthermore, the Border counties have received approximately £96 million in total funding from the International Fund for Ireland since its inception in 1987.  Indications are that US support for the fund will continue while the Agreement and the new institutional arrangements are bedding down. There are no plans for an aditional investment fund for the Border counties on top of this.</P>

      <P>A multi-annual budgeting system is being introduced under the strategic management initiative.  The aim is to put in place a framework within which the Government can consider overall budgetary, taxation and expenditure priorities in a mediumterm context.</P>
      <P>The last two budgets made significant progress with the introduction of the new system.  A multi-annual projection of the major revenue and expenditure aggregates on the assumption of unchanged policies was published with the 1997 budget.  The spending data were in summary form, without a breakdown by Vote group.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget included, as part of the medium-term assessment, projections of expenditure by ministerial Vote group for the period 1998-2000, again on the basis of a &ldquo;no-policychange&rdquo; assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my 1998 budget speech, I said that I will be <Col N="1328" /> considering, in preparing the 1999 budget, the next stage of the move to multi-annual budgeting. This would involve the Government making decisions on resource allocation over a three year period covering the main budgetary aggregates. Current and capital expenditure would be disaggregated into financial envelopes for each ministerial Vote group.  In effect, the financial envelopes would show the amounts that would be allocated to Departments for the period 1999-2001.</P>
    <P>To allow Departments to plan their spending programmes, the allocations would show the resources the Government was prepared to allocate, provided that the economy develops as predicted.</P>
    <P>The methodology for the financial envelopes is as follows: aggregate limits on spending, current and capital, are decided by the Government, on my recommendation, for the relevant period &mdash; at present the period is 1999-2001; the Estimates and Public Capital Programme are decided by the Government for the first year of the period and the associated &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; costings for the later years are agreed and decided; and the difference between the decided aggregate spending limits and the aggregate &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; costs is the margin by which planned spending should change &mdash; this margin and any created by the reallocation of resources across Vote groups is allocated to Vote groups and when added to their agreed &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; costings equals their financial envelopes.</P>
    <P>During this year, &ldquo;no-policy-change&rdquo; costings have been updated and decided, most recently after the 1999 Abridged Estimates were decided.</P>
    <P>My Department is now working to present to me proposed financial envelopes for the years 2000 and 2001.  My proposals on the matter will be submitted to the Government and I aim to publish with the budget the allocations decided by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is essential to the success of the new approach that Departments contain their spending within the parameters laid down by the Government.  The wider managerial reforms which are also being introduced under the strategic management initiative aim to ensure that Departments have the capacity to do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 53 and 72 of Deputies Rabbitte and McDowell, respectively, together.</P>
      <P>There has been no delay in the drafting of legislation.  However, a draft Bill cannot be finalised for bringing before Dáil Éireann until a number of complex legal issues have been resolved &mdash; and every effort is being made to resolve these.  Indeed, the Government's response to the resolution of 21 October adverted specifically to the need to obtain considered legal advice in the matter.</P>
      <P>Since the resolution was passed by Dáil Éireann on 21 October, there has been an intensive examination of the key issues both in my Department and in the Office of the Attorney General with a view to meeting the wishes of the House.  The legal adviser to the Committee of Public Accounts and officials of the Attorney General have met on a number of occasions, most recently last Thursday, 12 November, to discuss legal issues in relation to these matters.  In addition, the Committee of Public Accounts has been in contact with my Department to convey its views on key features of the committee's report.  I have brought a number of progress reports on these matters to meetings of the Government.</P>
      <P>Members of the committee are fully aware that the proposals in their first interim report require careful examination.  <i>Inter alia</i>, they involve the provision of new statutory powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General, a constitutional officer.  Such a move cannot be entered into without proper consideration of all the legal implications.</P>
      <P>The Interim Report of the Committee of Public Accounts contains proposals on legislation affecting the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts, 1923 and 1993, and the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997.</P>
      <P>The route proposed in the interim report is innovative in terms of parliamentary procedure as well as in law.  We have few precedents to guide us.  While I am not yet in a position to give a definite date for the publication of a Bill, I assure the House that every effort has been made to achieve a speedy resolution of the matters arising and to bring forward the legislation without delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 63, 64, 66, 75, 79, 257, 260, 262, 273, 274, 283 and 293 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided today to pursue an application to EUROSTAT, the Statistical Service of the European Commission, for a change from Ireland's current status as a single region to one comprising two regions.  The application involves reclassification of Ireland's statistical regions in the European Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units.  One region would comprise the current sub-regions of the Border, west &mdash; to include counties Clare and Kerry &mdash; and midlands, and the other region would comprise the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>I refer Deputies to a press release which is being issued today by the Government Information Services, copies of which will be placed in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>My lengthy address to the House on 10 November last opening the debate on regionalisation dealt in depth with the issue.  I propose in today's replies to pick up only on points not already covered in that statement.</P>
      <P>I do not envisage that the regionalisation proposal will have significant implications for the overall delivery of public services.  The Government is, however, committed to a revised regional structure in the content of regionalisation and will discuss this further with the existing regional authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that regionalisation will assist more balanced economic growth, thereby helping to contribute to more balanced population growth. <Col N="1332" /></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied, on the basis of the trend in tax receipts and from the information supplied by the Revenue Commissioners, that the figures given as average tax paid by PAYE, farmers and self-employed are consistent with the income levels for each group.  The efficiency of the tax collection system for all sectors of the economy has improved significantly in recent years.  The Revenue Commissioners are continuing with their overall successful approach to compliance which is designed, on the one hand, to make procedures easier for those who are trying to meet their tax obligations and, on the other, to pursue people who do not pay on time or at all.  Measures taken to improve collection and compliance include modern payment methods including direct debits, programmes to secure returns from those who do not file, the large-scale targeted audit programme which resulted in some £127 million being collected in 1997, the random audit programme which exposes every taxpayer to the risk of audit, introduction of withholding tax and tax clearance procedures, significant use of the power to attach assets of tax defaulters, as well as other strong enforcement measures, new local collection and arrears compliance initiative, measures to tackle black economy operators, and a more active prosecution policy in cases of serious evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revenue have confirmed that these measures are underpinning the improved compliance in the tax system in recent years.  The measures needed are reviewed each year on the basis of Revenue's analysis of the returns and levels of compliance for that year. <Col N="1333" /> Farmers are assessable to tax on farming profits on actual income on the same basis as other self-employed taxpayers.  The normal self-employed allowances may be offset against farming profits as well as special provisions in relation to stock relief and income averaging.  As with all self-employed taxpayers, farmers are obliged to make annual returns of income and pay the appropriate tax by the due dates.  Returns by farmers are also subject to audit in the same manner as other self-employed taxpayers.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicated that the compliance levels of farmers are comparable to those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that farmers also pay income tax through the PAYE system on employment income earned outside the farm by themselves or their spouses.  This is estimated at £92 million for 1995-6, the latest year for which the relevant data is available, and was paid by 25,324 individuals or couples.  In addition, farmers contribute PRSI and levy payments through the self assessment system.  Their contributions under these headings in 1997 are estimated at £26 million.</P>

      <P>Preparations for the adoption of the irrevocable conversion rates to the euro are well under way.  At the informal ECOFIN meeting on 26 September last, the economic and finance Ministers of the EU member states adopting the euro as their single currency, the governors of the central banks of these member states, the European Commission <Col N="1334" /> and the European Central Bank agreed a timetable and procedure for the fixing of the conversion rates on 31 December 1998.  The Council will adopt the Regulation on these rates in the afternoon of 31 December 1998.</P>
      <P>All of the authorities involved in the adoption of the irrevocable conversion rates are making arrangements to ensure that all matters relating to the changeover weekend are dealt with.  For example, the Governing Council of the European System of Central Banks has set up an <i>ad hoc &ldquo;Changeover Weekend Committee&rdquo;.  This Committee will organise the monitoring of devel</i>opments <i>vis-á-vis</i> the final migration to the euro within the European Central Bank and the national central banks and in the banking and financial industry, both prior to and during the changeover weekend.  This committee includes representatives from the Central Bank of Ireland and from other national central banks of the monetary union.</P>
      <P>I understand that for many months now the Central Bank has been working closely with the financial institutions to ensure that all the technical aspects of the changeover weekend have been identified so as to ensure that the changeover will be as smooth as possible.  For example, there has been extensive testing of the wholesale interbank payments system during the last two months and this will continue over the remaining weeks.  The procedures to redenominate Irish government securities into euro will be tested by the Bank during the weekend 21/22 November 1998.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the Central Bank that apart from the redenomination of its own accounts and the Government accounts and the changeover of the Government stock register, it will provide contact people for retail banks in key specialist areas over the changeover weekend.</P>

    <P>We have stated our agreement with the Commission's view that the present own resources system does work well and is broadly equitable as contributions have become increasingly aligned with respective shares in GNP.  We also support the Commission view that the net balance concept represents only a narrow view of, and fails to take account of the benefits accruing to member states from participation in the EU.  In addressing this issue one must look to the significant economic <Col N="1336" /> advantages, which we all share, from the single market.  As the Commission's report points out, CAP and Structural Fund expenditure benefit not only the immediate recipients but also give rise to spillover effects transcending national borders.</P>
    <P>I have laid down a clear marker that the expenditure option which suggests national co-financing of the Common Agricultural Policy is completely unacceptable to Ireland.  It would do very little to address the position of net contributors. If pursued it would be at the expense largely of less prosperous member states.  In effect it would create a problem for the least prosperous member states without effectively solving the perceived problem of new contributors.</P>

      <P>Since then, the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland (ECBI), which I set up in May and which is chaired by a senior official in my Department, has carried out its own nationally-representative survey about awareness of the euro among the public here.

I should also point to the Forfás Business Awareness Campaign, which has been running for nearly two years now and has produced, <i>inter alia</i>, a very extensive information pack along with a guide for SME's, a guide for the retail sector, a guide for trade unions, an information technology guide and a set of possible actions for companies in relation to sterling.  The Forfás documents have been widely distributed.</P>
    <P>In September, I launched the results of the ECBI survey and a copy of a press release, which summarised the key points, was distributed to every Member of the Oireachtas and to Ireland's members of the European Parliament.  Briefly, the survey results indicated that: 94 per cent of people were aware of the single currency, 85 per cent knew Ireland will participate from the beginning, 59 per cent knew the name of the currency, 59 per cent knew that the euro can be used for non-cash transactions from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>On the foot ot the results of the ECBI survey, the board's main focus for the second phase of its communications campaign, which began in September, is to increase awareness of the name of the new currency &mdash; the euro &mdash; and of the 1 January 1999 start date.</P>
    <P>The second phase of the public information campaign now under way includes the ECBI web site (www.  irlgov.  ie/ecbi-euro), a teletext page (RTE 1, Aertel, page 678), and the TV series Living with the euro, currently running on RTE 1 on Sunday nights at 11.00 p.m., which is co-sponsored by the ECBI.  Also, the ECBI has conducted training programmes on the euro for the civil and public sector and has, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, produced an information leaflet which is being circulated to all schools.  The ECBI has also run briefings for nationally-representative groups which, it is hoped, will in turn use their networks to further disseminate information on the euro.  Contacts with TV and radio programmers are also in train to promote the inclusion of topics on the euro in programming.</P>
    <P>A national press advertising campaign on the euro is being run from 16 November to 29 November 1998.  This will include all national daily and Sunday papers, provincial press and a number of weekly publications.</P>
    <P>Tomorrow, 18 November, I will launch the third edition of the National Changeover Plan. Briefly, the plan sets out the arrangements that will be made by the public sector, the banks and building societies and others to facilitate the changeover to the euro.  Two editions of the plan have already been published.  I will also be launching a public information video on the euro which will be made widely available.  The video will also be available in a signed version, with subtitles, in order to be accessible to deaf people. Plans are also under way for further large-scale <Col N="1338" /> distribution of the information leaflet issued in June-July.</P>
    <P>The board has also set up a consultative panel to advise on the information requirements of people with special needs, such as elderly people and people with a disability, and to help the board distribute information to them.  The ECBI has already produced 250 audio tapes for blind people in conjunction with the National Council for the Blind (NCBI) and further such initiatives are under way with the NCBI.</P>
    <P>The ECBI Secretariat administers, on behalf of the European Commission, an EU-funded Programme for information activities about the euro being carried out by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).  Under this programme, a total of 26 NGO bodies have been approved for EU funding amounting to a total of £200,000 in respect of information activities on the euro in 1998.  These bodies include organisations representing consumers, community, elderly people and women's groups, trade unions and trade and professional associations.</P>
    <P>The ECBI will be undertaking further public information initiatives in the run-up to the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 and beyond.</P>
    <P>In the light of the above, it is clear that preparations in this country for the changeover to the euro are at an advanced stage and that a great deal of work has been and is being done to prepare the public for the changeover to the euro. The changeover will of course not be complete until after the introduction of euro notes and coins in January 2002.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may recall that, during the debate on the Central Bank Act, 1998, I outlined the position in relation to an examination undertaken by officials in my Department into the general issue of dormant accounts held in credit institutions. That investigation identified potential legal and constitutional issues, particularly in relation to property rights, which have to be taken into account in the development of policy in relation to such accounts.  I pointed out that this is a very complex issue and one which requires very careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1339" /> I have made it clear before this that I am not going to let the matter rest and that I will investigate the issue of dormant accounts thoroughly during my term of office.  In that context, I have directed my Department to produce proposals designed to resolve the difficulties identified by the earlier examination.  The Department is close to completing work on draft proposals along these lines and the next step is to have these examined from a legal and constitutional view-point.  I do not believe it would be appropriate for me to release any of the results of the work undertaken by my officials until the further investigations I consider necessary are completed.  I hope the work now under way will enable me to propose an appropriate solution to Government.</P>

    <P>The working group on legal and consumer issues in banking undertook a considerable amount of valuable research and analysis on the current regulatory framework but had not agreed conclusions by 20 October.  I have nevertheless agreed that a document setting out the progress the group had made should be made available to the implementation advisory group.  The document, which represents &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo;, was made available to the implementation advisory group on 12 November, and I expect it will prove useful to it in its work.  The implementation advisory group, which had its first meeting on November 5, is due to present its report by February <Col N="1342" /> 28 next.  It is not my intention to publish the last draft document prepared by the working group on legal and consumer issues in banking, which has been furnished to the implementation advisory group on the basis that it represents a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There are already adequate reliefs in the tax system for such costs.  Where the costs are of a current nature, e.g. repair and maintenance expenditure, they will be deductible in the year in which they are incurred.  Capital costs incurred in enhancing a capital asset or acquiring new assets, e.g. new computer software result in identifiable future benefits and qualify for capital allowances at 15 per cent per annum, 10 per cent in year seven.  I have no plans to add to these reliefs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in my reply to a number of similar questions on the 14 October last, I am proceeding with the implementation of the Government's decision to dispose of the State's interest in ICC bank plc.  In relation to ACC and TSB Banks, the boards and managements of both banks have now entered into formal discussions with a view to exploring the option of a merger of the banks and a flotation of the merged entity.  I welcome this development and I will give positive and careful consideration to the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO industrial earnings release which was recently published shows that average weekly earnings in the manufacturing sector increased by 6.1 per cent in the year to June 1998.  This comprises an increase of 6.6 per cent in the hourly rate and a decrease of 0.7 per cent in the number of hours worked.  The annual average increase in weekly earnings in 1997 was 2.8 per cent, while average hourly earnings increased by 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>The CSO data on industrial and manufacturing earnings for June are early estimates and are subject to revison, while the March figures, shown in the same release, are provisional in nature.  It would be unwise, at this stage, to place too much reliance on these figures given their totally provisional nature.  We will not have a firm picture until the final June figures and further CSO data become available.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency. The figures are a cause for concern and my Department will continue to monitor the situation carefully.  Wage moderation is essential to ensure that we maintain our competitiveness, particularly in the context of EMU.  All parties to Partnership 2000 must remain vigilant in ensuring that the commitments entered into continue to be observed.</P>

      <Quest>if the EU has rationed the number of new mobile foreign investments which IDA Ireland can support with State aid; whether this ration has been broken down into regional quotas; the way in which splitting the country into two regions for EU aid will impact upon the level of support which IDA Ireland could offer projects in the different regions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As part of the agreement reached with the EU Commission on the introduction of a standard rate of 12.5 per cent corporation tax by 2003, it has been agreed that the annual number of new projects to be grant-aided by IDA Ireland in the transition period will not exceed the average of the last five years, that is, 77 projects per annum.  This is intended to limit the number of new companies which may become eligible for the 10 per cent rate which the Commission deems to be an unacceptable State aid.</P>
      <P>Companies already liable for the 10 per cent rate will retain liability for that rate until 2010 for eligible activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expansions by existing companies are not <Col N="1354" /> restricted in any way and there are no constraints on where firms may choose to locate.</P>
    <P>Government support to enterprise must conform to the limits set by the EU regional aid guidelines, the latest version of which will come into effect, generally, in January 2000.  The guidelines lie within the competence of the Commission.</P>
    <P>At present, the development agencies can offer assistance to enterprises of up to 57 per cent of investment costs in the non-designated areas, up to 71 per cent in the designated areas and up to 75 per cent in Gaeltacht areas.  In practice, of course, the assistance offered is well below these limits.</P>
    <P>Under the latest EU regulations, Ireland will be treated as comprising 8 Article 92(3)(c) regions (our Regional Authority areas) and each will have a ceiling on the aid which can be offered to enterprise.  The limit for each area will depend on its GDP/unemployment rate, but may not exceed 20 per cent of investment costs, with a top-up of up to 10 per cent for SMEs.  Not only is the Commission limiting aid payable across the Union to curb harmful competitive bidding between member states, but the new rules reflect Ireland's much improved economic status, that is, we are no longer one of the poorest areas of the EU.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a new Objective One region in the area comprising the three sub-regions of the west, midlands and Border, that area will qualify for the highest regional aid status, known as Article 92(3)(a), at present enjoyed by the whole State.  The aid limits in this case would probably be in the region of up to 40 per cent of investment costs, with a top-up of up to 15 per cent for SMEs.</P>
    <P>The new limits are of course, ceilings.  In practice, the agencies will continue to operate on a value for money basis and to offer assistance at the appropriate level in each case.</P>

      <P>In July 1997 my Department developed a year 2000 plan which identified all of the IT systems and applications in operation in the Department and the action necessary in relation to each to ensure that they are year 2000 compliant.  An internal year 2000 monitoring committee was set up with the remit of overseeing progress on the implementation of the year 2000 plan.  This committee meets fortnightly to ensure continuous and scheduled progress on the project.  Two staff members are dedicated full-time to the year 2000 <Col N="1355" /> project and others are assigned as the need arises. My Department has also contracted the services of outside consultants where necessary.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in September 1997 the Government set up an independent monitoring committee to oversee progress in relation to year 2000 compliance throughout the Civil and Public Service.  This committee reports regularly to Government on progress being made within each Department.  The year 2000 project for my Department is progressing well and this is borne out in the reports prepared for Government by the monitoring committee.  I am confident that the schedules set for implementation of the year 2000 project in my Department are realistic and will be met.</P>

      <P>On 27 October 1997 I appointed Mr. Lyndon MacCann, BL as inspector to Bula Resources (Holdings) plc under section 14 of the Companies Act, 1990.  Mr. MacCann's report was published on 22 July 1998 and was sent to various parties, including Bula, the Irish Stock Exchange and the DPP.  The total cost of the investigation has amounted to about £201,000.  This has been paid for by my Department, as the 1990 Act does not provide for the recovery of costs from any other party in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having examined the report and the comments of various parties with whom I have been in contact, I have recently indicated to Bula that I am considering taking further action against the company for possible infringements of the Companies Acts.  I have also written to the Irish Stock Exchange asking <i>inter alia</i> if it is now satisfied that Bula fully complies with its requirements.  I have identified the need to make some legislative changes, one of which, if implemented, would enable me to recover the cost to the State of any <Col N="1356" /> future investigations undertaken under section 14 of the 1990 Act.</P>

      <P>Section 24 of the Companies Act, 1963, gives power to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to allow companies to be registered without the addition of the word &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; or &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo; to its name. The approval of the Minister is granted in the form of a licence.</P>
      <P>Before deciding to grant such a licence, the Minister must be satisfied that the company or proposed company was formed or is being formed for the purpose of promoting commerce, art, science, religion, charity or any other useful object, that it intends to apply its income or profits, if any, in promoting its objects and that it intends to prohibit the payment of any dividend to its members.  Such companies are normally formed as guaranteed companies without a share capital.</P>
      <P>An examination of such companies on the Companies Office register indicated that there are 636 companies, including about 82 dissolved companies registered without the word &ldquo;Limited&rdquo; or &ldquo;Teoranta&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies is an independent statutory officer with powers under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893. Section 18 of the 1893 Act provides that the Registrar of Friendly Societies may, if he thinks fit, on the application of ten members of a society, appoint an accountant or actuary to inspect the books of the society and to report thereon.  The section goes on to provide that the applicants shall deposit with the Registrar such sum as security for the cost of the proposed inspection as the Registrar may require and that all expenses of the inspection shall be met by the applicants or out of the funds of the society or by the members or officers or by former members or officers in such proportions as the Registrar may direct.</P>
      <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies informs me that he received a request on 5 October 1998, signed by ten members of Oldcastle Co-operative Creamery Limited, although the request was headed Oldcastle Co-operative Society Limited, in accordance with rule 6 of the society's registered rules and section 18 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, although the Friendly Societies Act was cited in the request. The Registrar was requested to appoint an independent accountant to inspect the books and affairs of the society.  The request went on to specifically ask that: the inspection clearly identify any loss making sections of the society's business; clearly establish the ownership and value of all assets which are believed to form part of the society and to establish the actual milk price paid to suppliers to date during 1998.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to receiving the request, the Registrar's office became aware that the request for the inspection arose out of a meeting of members of the society which had been held in September last at which an &ldquo;action committee&rdquo; was elected. Meetings were subsequently held between this committee and the committee of management of the society.  The Registrar understands that the committee of management has agreed to resign <i>en masse</i> at the annual general meeting of the society in late November and to offer themselves for re-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the composition of the committee of management of the society may be significantly different <Col N="1362" /> after the AGM, the Registrar has decided to defer consideration of the request until then.  The Registrar's office wrote to the chairman of the action committee on 11 November to inform him of what the Registrar proposed and undertook to contact him after the AGM to establish whether the applicant wishes to proceed with the request.</P>

      <P>My Department has not provided financial support to the Consumers' Association of Ireland during the past 12 months.  However, I am aware that the association has experienced difficulties this year following the ceasing of financial supports by the European Commission.  When I met the association earlier this year I assured them that my Department would be pleased to work with them with a view to ensuring that their current difficulties with the Commission were not repeated in 1999 and I understand that the then Director of Consumer Affairs gave a similar assurance.  In addition, my Department sought to assist the association in the current year by way of financial support for a relevant project to be undertaken by the CAI.  I understand, however, that the association was not able to take up this offer, mainly because of time constraints and staff shortages.</P>
      <P>I also wrote to Commissioner Bonino, who has responsibility for consumer matters, requesting her support for the restoration of financial support to the association.  In her reply, she indicated that she would be prepared to re-examine the situation if her Directorate's budgetary situation so allowed and if no alternative solution could be found for funding the CAI this year.  Such support is now unlikely given the late stage of the year. Since my meeting with the CAI and correspondence with the Commission, my Department and the Director of Consumer Affairs have remained in contact with the association with a view to further assisting as possible.</P>

      <P>A list of the missions undertaken on behalf of Enterprise Ireland is attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply of 3 November to Deputy Stanton, part of my trade brief involves me, as Minister for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, and my colleague, The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in trade negotiations and discussions aimed at opening markets in third countries in the EU and WTO context.  In addition, we consider it vital to make time to lead the important trade and market development missions which, time after time, have demonstrated the value of a ministerial <Col N="1364" /> presence in guaranteeing the attention of important figures from the target country.  I also undertake visits to companies' headquarters in Ireland to assist in their exporting efforts.</P>
    <P>It is a key priority of this Government to maximise opportunities for Irish companies.  Ministerial presence in trade missions ensures the participation of high level influencial persons from key target customer groups, whom Irish companies might find it impossible to meet otherwise.  It allows access to senior political figures and important buyers and gives an opportunity to extend invitations at a senior level.  In turn, such invitations can bring important buyers to Ireland thus increasing their understanding of the attractiveness of trade opportunities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Trade and Market Development Missions undertaken by the Ms Mary Harney, TD, Tanaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Mr. Tom Kitt, TD, Minister for Labour, Trade and Consumer Affairs, on behalf of Enterprise Ireland.</P>

    <P>Financial assistance was made available to Mayo County Council for works at Bertra (£78,750) and Claggan (£11,250).</P>
    <P>In the 1999 Book of Estimates the Government has provided for a significant increase in capital coast protection works to £3.741 million, more than a four fold increase.  In addition to proposals from Mayo County Council, I have received a comprehensive array of proposals for coast protection works from local authorities right around the coast.  I am developing an overall national strategy which will facilitate systematic prioritisation of coast protection needs, in consultation with local authorities.</P>

However, the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector in Ireland set afforestation targets for the country of 25,000 ha.  per annum to the year 2000 and 20,000 ha.  per annum in the period 2001 to year 2030.</P>

      <P>My Department has initiated a year 2000 compliance programme for its IT systems, office equipment and other plant with a view to achieving compliance by 30 June 1999.  A year 2000 advisory group is being tasked with the co-ordination and monitoring of progress of the programme.</P>
      <P>The key strategies of the programme to achieve compliance are: assignment of resources to initiate the programme; detailed inventory of IT systems, equipment and plant; assessment of compliance of identified systems; prioritisation of work based on outcome of assessment; and project scheduling-timetables to achieve compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> A detailed inventory of the Department's IT systems and software in use has been compiled. The Department has drawn up timetables for the assessment and testing of the most critical systems to avoid any interruption to the Department's business.  A more detailed timetable of projects to ensure completion of the programme within a realistic time-scale will be completed by mid-December 1998.</P>
    <P>The software systems which are in use in the Department are broken into two categories &mdash; developed systems, where there has been some customisation involved, and &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; products which are used as installed out of the box. The vast majority of the Department's software falls into the latter category and year 2000 compliant versions will, in most instances, be available should the versions currently in use create difficulties.  The resource implications of dealing with customised software are being addressed by the Department as a priority.</P>
    <P>In addition to normal office plant and equipment, the Department operates a major communications network for marine emergency response by the Irish Marine Emergency Rescue Services, IMES.  This equipment includes transmitters, radio consoles, UPS, etc.  All equipment used by IMES is critical to the Department's business. A detailed inventory and assessment of all office plant and equipment is being prepared with a view to ensuring compliance at an early date.</P>
    <P>Once the assessment of the compliance status of all systems is known the programme will focus on the replacement or upgrading needs of prioritised systems.  My Department aims to achieve compliance by 30 June 1999.</P>

      <P>Some 61 licences were granted by my Department during 1994; 34 during 1995; 59 during 1996; 54 during 1997 and 42 so far this year.  It is anticipated that a further 60 will be offered in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, provides a modern licensing framework for all aquaculture, including an independent Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board to consider appeals against licensing decisions.  A full environmental impact assessment is required for all proposed finfish developments as well as some shellfish developments where it is considered to be in the public interest.  Applications for licences generally are considered on a bay by bay basis so as to take account of all relevant factors including environmental impact.  The Act provides for new ministerial powers to revoke licences where the holder is in breach of licence conditions and enhanced powers to tackle unauthorised activity. All licensed operations undergo regular monitoring by the Department, including site inspections and obligatory reporting of fish health status, diseases, mortalities and escapes.</P>
      <P>All applications for aquaculture licences are subject to a rigorous process of evaluation by my Department with the assistance of an Aquaculture Licence Advisory Committee comprising of representatives from the Department, the Marine Institute, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Central Fisheries Board.  Comments or objections on aquaculture development are invited through a statutory public consultation process.</P>

      <P>The proposals contained in this document will inform my thinking on future funding support for aquaculture development post 1999 and will be factored into the process of discussion and negotiation on Structural Funds for the fisheries sector as a whole in the period 2000-2006.</P>

      <P>End 1997 statistics show 3,096 whole time equivalent jobs in the aquaculture sector.  Of these 2,029 were in the shellfish industry, <Col N="1373" /> 971 were in the finfish sector and the remaining 96 were employed in direct services or consultancy capacities.</P>
      <P>The Irish aquaculture sector is producing over 38,000 tonnes of fish and shellfish per annum with a value of over £58 million to the economy.  This represents a steady growth curve from small beginnings in the 1980s and the sector is an increasingly significant contributor to Irish seafood exports and now supplies over 25 per cent of the raw material needs of the indigenous fish processing industry.</P>
      <P>In order to maximise the potential of the aquaculture sector for growth and jobs a strategic review has been commissioned.  I have mandated the consultants to undertake a comprehensive economic analysis of the Irish aquaculture industry by reference to domestic and global factors, taking a medium to long-term approach.  The consultants will also recommend on future development strategies for the aquaculture industry in Ireland with particular emphasis on overcoming perceived constraints and on maximising sustainable jobs production and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The study is to be completed early in 1999 and the results will inform and guide policy development as well as the strategic approach to job targets and investment post 2000 by BIM and Údarás na Gaeltachta as well as the industry itself.</P>

      <P>The Marine Institute, on behalf of my Department, undertakes ongoing regular programmes of sea lice inspections at all marine salmon farms.  The staff of the regional fisheries boards are given schedules of these inspections in advance and have the option to attend as observers.  Reports of the results of these inspections are forwarded to the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>It is in the interests of salmon farmers themselves to minimise sea lice levels on fish farms and the industry co-operates closely with the monitoring programme.  Where sea lice levels are found to be at elevated levels, remedial measures are put in place.  Persistently high lice levels at a particular farm should they arise, would require the introduction of very site specific lice management strategies which could include reduced stocking levels, accelerated harvesting, and a review of fallowing strategies at the site.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department, in common with other Departments, has established a plan to ensure that it is year 2000 compliant by the end of 1999. This plan covers all IT hardware and software along with other office equipment and plant.  The plan includes the following: an inventory of all hardware and software in the Department, close contact with suppliers, on-site testing and replacement-upgrading of any non-compliant hardware or software.  The plan was submitted to the Interdepartmental <Col N="1377" /> Year 2000 Monitoring Committee in December 1997 and updated status reports are submitted to this committee every two months.</P>
    <P>Work to date includes the completion of inventories and the certification of certain systems as year 2000 compliant.  In the context of the Department's quality customer care strategy, the remedial work required for the Passport Office is well under way.  Work to ensure the continuity of internal services such as word processing, e-mail, financial and personal management systems etc., is progresssing.</P>
    <P>Progress on the implementation of the plan is being closely monitored in conjunction with the Year 2000 Monitoring Committee to ensure that the necessary work will be completed in good time.  With the implementation of the Department's plan in 1999, it is expected that full year 2000 compliance will be achieved and that, therefore, no adverse effects of any significance will be experienced by the Department.</P>

      <P>The Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Bill passed the United States House of Representatives and Senate by unanimous consent in early October and was signed into law by President Clinton on 30 October 1998.  The Bill amends the US immigration law to insert a new visa programme, which is expected to be called the Q-2 or &ldquo;Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training&rdquo; visa programme.  The Q-2 programme will allow 4,000 people per annum aged 35 or under and having residence in Northern Ireland or one of the six Border counties to come to the US for a period of not more than three years for the purpose of developing job skills and conflict resolution abilities.  The Bill as passed into law is substantially the same as proposed by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) with a downward adjustment in the number of visas available and the length of stay allowed.  The only substantial amendment from what was originally proposed was the dropping of the waiver that would have allowed Irish undocumented in the US to benefit from the new programme.</P>
      <P>Now the legislation has been signed, the embassy in Washington understands that an inter-agency consultation process is getting under way.  The legislation provides for the programme to be approved by both the Attorney General, that is the Immigration and Naturalisation Service, and the Secretary of State, that is, the Department of State, and as such it can be assumed a potentially complex consultation process will have to be completed before the programme will be in place and ready to start accepting applications.  It is widely expected that this process will take some months to complete. The embassy in Washington will continue to closely monitor the progress of the process.</P>
      <P>I greatly appreciate the efforts of Congressman Jim Walsh who in July announced a bipartisan congressional effort with Senator Alfonse D'Amato to introduce the legislation and others in the Congress who promoted this Bill.  It is a further valuable contribution by the United States which underpins the peace process.</P>

      <P>On 4 September last, the Taoiseach and President Clinton digitally signed a US Ireland Joint Comminiqué on Electronic Commerce which identifies shared principles and points of common interest held by Ireland and the US in relation to the development of electronic commerce, and which identifies specific areas where increased co-operation between the two countries might take place.  Since then the Government has moved to ensure that the vision outlined at the digital signing of making Ireland a European electronic commerce hub becomes a reality.  Specific actions taken include: the introduction of full competition in the telecommunications market from 1 December 1998 through waiving of the existing derogation; the sale of Cablelink and the initial public offering of Telecom Éireann in order to foster competition in the domestic telecommunications market; the introduction of primary legislation to promote infrastructural development; the establishment of a public private partnership to enhance Ireland's international connectivity to global Internet networks; and the publishing of a Framework for a National Policy on Cryptography and Digital Signatures. It is intended that a Bill on this issue will be published early in 1999.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications, which I established in June of this year with a mandate to advise the Government on how to position Ireland to capitalise on the growth in electronic commerce, will present its report to the Taoiseach tomorrow, Wednesday, 18 November 1998.  The report will be published shortly thereafter.  It is intended that further actions will be taken in the light of this report.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke): The millennium bug is a problem caused by electronic components and computer software not correctly recognising the onset of the new millennium.  If not rectified, this would have the potential to cause wide-ranging failures of computer software and electronically controlled equipment much of which is vital for the smooth running of a technological society such as our own.</P>
    <P>My Department has had in place for the past two years a programme to deal systematically with this problem.  This programme is very well advanced with the bulk of the remedial work and testing being due for completion by the end of this year and the remainder by early to mid next year.</P>
    <P>I am also monitoring on a regular basis the progress of the State agencies under my aegis in preparing for the year 2000.  I am informed by these agencies that they are satisfied that all their critical systems will be operational in time for 1 January 2000.</P>
    <P>There are formal regular reporting procedures on progress in respect of both my Department and the State agencies to Government.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, confident in the ability of both my Department and the State agencies for which I am responsible to cope adequately with the millennium bug.  However, as a matter of prudence, I will be ensuring that appropriate contingency plans are in place.</P>

      <P>New equipment for the Defence Forces is acquired in accordance with national procedures relating to public procurement.  Central to those procedures is the requirement to allow fair competition between suppliers through the submission of tenders which are assessed on the basis of obtaining best value for money by the Department.

    <P>In stage one a general request for proposals, RFPs, based on a broad-parameter specification was issued to interested companies on 24 April 1998 with the aim of establishing product availability in the marketplace as well as an indication of the costs involved.

    <P>In the second stage, which will commence shortly, a request for tenders, RFTs, based on a more precisely defined specification, will issue to a restricted list of companies &mdash; those successful in the first stage.  The project team, already in place, will manage the procurement process through all stages to ensure that value for money is obtained for the expenditure involved.  It is expected that a contract will be in place early in 1999.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 11 on 12 November, the case in question was technically and legally complex.  The decision by my Department in January 1990 to grant the import quota rights to the meat processors, rather than to Emerald Meats, was supported by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. It is the case that the courts subsequently found against the Department's interpretation of EU Regulations involved.  This does not, however, take from the fact that the decision was taken in good faith at the time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the officials involved had acted in good faith, even thought their interpretation of EU law was subsequently found to be incorrect, and while there were shortcomings in the administrative procedures and customer relations practices employed, it does not merit disciplinary action.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any restriction which discriminates against Irish beef on the French market.  In France, as in most other member states, there has been an increased emphasis on the labelling of beef in the past number of years. I am aware that the French retail trade requires certain labelling information for beef consistent with Council Regulation 820/97 and Irish exports fulfil these requirements.  France does operate a system of compulsory labelling in respect of its domestically produced beef, that is beef derived from cattle which were born, reared and slaughtered in France and the domestic market seems to have a preference for the native product.  This system has been approved by the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>In consultation with the centre for management and organisation development of the Department of Finance, my Department completed a year 2000 assessment and compliance plan last year.  In August 1997 my Department set up a year 2000 project board, chaired by an assistant secretary, to oversee the work on year 2000 compliance.  As part of the preliminary impact assessment my Department identified some of the systems as being non-compliant.  Accordingly, remedial work is being carried out and some tasks have been completed.  The year 2000 project board meets on a monthly basis to review and monitor progress.  In addition a bi-monthly status report is forwarded to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee.  It is expected that work on the non-compliant systems will be completed by mid 1999.</P>
      <P>The headage-premia and export refunds systems are the main payment systems accounting for approximately £1.3 billion of my Department's total annual spend.  Year 2000 work has been completed on the export refunds applications code and on systems dealing with REPS and structural improvement measures.  Work on the headage and premia systems is at an advanced stage and should be completed by mid 1999.</P>

      <P>The EU Regulations which govern the area aid scheme stipulate that a penalty should apply to area aid applications received after the closing date.  In 1994, the closing date for receipt of area aid applications was 28 April.  As the 1994 area aid application for the person concerned was received on 12 May 1994, eight working days after the closing date, it was necessary to apply an 8 per cent reduction penalty.  Farmers were <Col N="1396" /> advised in 1994 by my Department that if there was any delay in acquiring maps, these could be submitted after the closing date of 28 April 1994. Applications had however to be submitted by the closing date to avoid penalties.</P>

      <P>The revised REPS package for natural heritage areas &mdash; NHAs &mdash; including special areas of conservation &mdash; SACs &mdash; and special protection areas &mdash; SPAs &mdash; and commonages requires that a framework plan be drawn up for each commonage. It will take some time before framework plans will be available for all commonages.  In the meantime, as I announced last week, interim arrangements have been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to put a national commonage framework plan in place pending the completion of individual commonage framework plans.  Under these new arrangements, farmers in these areas either already in REPS or who join can avail of the higher rates of compensation of £80 per acre for the first 100 acres with additional payments for the next 200 acres.  The revised scheme necessitates an amendment to the REP scheme document and agri-environmental specifications to incorporate the new measure.  Copies of the revised scheme document and specifications will be available shortly as will application forms for the new REPS measure.</P>

    <P>In response to the trend An Bord Glas has been actively promoting the concept of producer groups as well as developing &ldquo;Quality Schemes&rdquo; aimed at helping producers to meet the increasingly more stringent requirements of the trade and the consumer.  Over the last 12 months An Bord Glas has engaged a consultant to assist producers wishing to come together to pack and deliver their produce to the central distributors. The 1999 Estimates published last week includes an additional provision for An Bord Glas which <Col N="1400" /> will enable it to continue its work with the producers.</P>

      <P>The import of pet cats and dogs takes place in accordance with the Rabies Orders 1972-1976. In effect, these orders provide for free movement of these animals from the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man as these countries share a common health status with Ireland, while animals from all other countries must undergo a period of six months quarantine in a premises approved by my Department.  The future requirements in relation to imports are under consideration.</P>
      <P>The recently published report of the Advisory Group on Quarantine established by the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommends that the quarantine system in place in the UK should be replaced with a system involving vaccination, blood-testing and microchip identification requirements for cats and dogs travelling between Great Britain and the member states of the European Union, the European Economic Area or rabies-free islands.  The report also states that a further period of up to three years would be required to enable the necessary arrangements to give effect to the recommendations to be put in place.</P>
      <P>I am following these developments closely as changes which might be contemplated in the UK system of quarantine controls would hold potential for Ireland given the common approach to rabies which both countries have followed over many years.  Ireland is this week hosting a meeting of the Rabies Control Liaison Group, which includes all participants in the common quarantine arrangements, i.e. Ireland, United Kingdom, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  This will provide a further opportunity for assessment of the conclusions and recommendations of the advisory group's report and of the developments which may flow from it.</P>

      <P>The common organisation of the EU sheep market provides for free trade in both live animals and in meat.  Ireland is a net beneficiary of this regime given that the 51,000 tonnes of sheepmeat exported annually, represents 75 per cent of our total production.  The decision to import lambs for slaughter is a commercial one for the processing industry.</P>
      <P>The total number of sheep slaughtered in export approved factories in the January-November 1998 period was 2.88 million, with slaughter in local abattoirs representing a further 800,000 approximately.  No accurate data is available on the level of live lamb imports generally. However, my Department is aware via the ANIMO system of animal movement that during the period January-November 10,800 lambs were imported from Scotland, representing 0.3 per cent of the total slaughter for the period.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to make an accurate economic assessment of the impact of these imports given that the UK is a significant exporter of sheepmeat and the relatively low percentage of throughput which these imports represent.</P>

One animal died and was replaced by an in-calf heifer.  Before payment can be made confirmation must be obtained that the replacement animal is due to calve as declared. The person named was written to on 30 October 1998 and asked to advise the Department when the in-calf heifer had calved.  To date, no reply has been received from the person named.  The Department will accept a scanning certificate or AI insemination certificate as evidence that the animal in question was in-calf at the time of replacement.</P>

      <P>Due to the volume of work in the Limerick office a backlog of about four months has arisen in the processing of applications under the scheme of early retirement from farming.  Currently the staffing of the office is under review with the objective of improving the situation there.  However, this application will be dealt with as soon as possible.  I would point out, however, that in no case does the processing time result in a financial loss to a retiring farmer.  The operational procedures for the scheme specifically ensure that the date of receipt in the Department of a valid application determines the date from which payment is made.</P>

      <P>Measure 5 of the REP scheme on the maintenance of farm and field boundaries sets out the objectives to be achieved with regard to hedgerows.  Among the objectives is the management of hedgerows, including the inplanting of suitable hedgerow species, to encourage their development with a diversity of height, stages of growth and form in the interests of wildlife, stock control and scenic appearance.</P>
      <P>The specifications do not require the cutting of hedgerows.  However, where this takes place the methodology is specified.  A management option is to leave the hedge undisturbed.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding in this issue my Department has been examining its operation and will be issuing revised specifications to make it clearer that hedgerows can be maintained in their present state, height, width and uncut-untrimmed where such hedgerows are of good quality.</P>
      <P>Farmers will be encouraged to retain hedgerows and confine maintenace to essential practices such as stockproofing, inplanting with suitable species and the control of invasive species.</P>

      <Quest>if the Revenue Commissioners introduced measures and an extensive advertising campaign in 1990 to highlight the circumstances in which a person could claim a refund of DIRT; if so, if the number of claimants increased as a result; the checks, if any, carried out on their entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that during April 1990, the Revenue Commissioners introduced measures, including an extensive advertising campaign, to highlight the circumstances in which refunds of DIRT could be claimed.  Radio and newspaper advertisements were placed to create an awareness that DIRT could be reclaimed in certain circumstances.  A leaflet (IT 5), detailing the circumstances in which DIRT could be reclaimed and explaining how refunds could be claimed, was published.  The leaflet incorporated a form which enabled claimants to request a claim form.</P>
      <P>As part of Revenue's ongoing campaign to create awareness that DIRT can be reclaimed in certain circumstances, I am informed that Revenue Leaflet IT 5 continued to be available in all tax offices up to last year.  Because of a lack of demand for it in recent years it is now discontinued and the information is contained in other Revenue leaflets.  Revenue Leaflet IT45 &mdash; allowances for over 65s was published in 1996.  The leaflet includes a section on DIRT which sets out the criteria for qualifying for a refund of DIRT. It was carried by An Post in all post offices between the months of January and May 1997.  In January 1997, a supply of Leaflet IT45 was issued to every organisation which deals with older people.  Revenue leaflets are currently on display in all tax offices and at exhibitions or shows at which Revenue has an information stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1411" /> In addition, persons who receive a DIRT repayment in one tax year are automatically issued with a DIRT reclaim form in the next tax year.  This form is issued at the beginning of the following tax year.</P>
    <P>The 1990 advertising campaign resulted in an increase in the number of claimants.  In the period 1 April 1990-30 September 1990, 6009 claims for refunds of DIRT were received.  In the comparable period in 1989, 4,261 such claims were received.  No comparable figures are available for more recent years.</P>
    <P>However, the numbers of repeat claim forms issued annually, which may be indicative of the trend in the numbers claiming repayment, is as follows:</P>

    <P>* The available statistics on refunds of deposit interest retention tax do not distinguish between refunds made to approved charities, those made to individuals aged 65 or over and those made to incapacited individuals.</P>
    <P>Persons who claim a repayment of DIRT complete a simplified claim form which requests details of certain information required in tax returns generally (e.g. other income, marital status, age (where relevant) etc.).  In designing the DIRT repayment claim form, Revenue was conscious of the need to make the procedures for making a claim as simple as possible.  On receipt of this information, Revenue checks the entitlements of the taxpayer, thereby ensuring the correct amount of tax is repaid, where appropriate. Revenue has no means of identifying persons who may be entitled to repayment of DIRT but who do not claim repayment.  It is for this reason that Revenue has been active in creating awareness among potential claimants, particularly older people, that DIRT can be reclaimed in certain circumstances. <Col N="1412" /></P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal instrument operated by the World Bank and IMF for alleviating the burden of third world debt is the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.</P>
      <P>The aim of the initiative is to ensure that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries which demonstrate a track record of sustained strong policy performance, are able to strengthen their poverty reduction programmes and permanently exit from future debt reschedulings.</P>
      <P>This initiative was endorsed by the bank and the fund in September 1996.  The initiative was designed to reduce the burden of debt for these countries to sustainable levels.  Those institutions to whom the debt was owed would be called on to make proportionate contributions to reducing the burden of servicing the debt.  The initiative called for participation by sovereign bilateral creditors as well as the multilateral creditor institutions. While it was open to bilateral creditors to contribute through debt forgiveness or rescheduling, the multilateral institutions would contribute mainly through financing debt service either from their own resources or through the contributions of their members, rather than through rescheduling.</P>
      <P>Nine countries have so far reached a decision point on debt sustainability.  Of these, two were judged not to need assistance, and the remaining seven require assistance totalling about $6.1 billion in nominal debt service relief.  The objective is to have all those countries which are likely to need relief in the process by the year 2000. Ireland has welcomed the initiative and supported efforts to make it more flexible and inclusive, particularly in relation to adequate account being taken of countries efforts to implement programmes and also of social as opposed to economic and financial criteria for qualifying for relief.</P>
      <P>Earlier inclusion of countries or increasing the extent of relief will increase the cost of the initiative. The focus in Washington was to ensure that adequate funding was in place to implement the initiative and that those countries which could benefit from it has appropriate programmes in place by the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I would draw the attention of the House to the measures in support of third world debt relief which the Government adopted last month.  These have allowed Ireland to move from its advocacy role in relation to debt relief and become a direct contributor to the HIPC initiative.  They will give Ministers increased moral authority to call for increased efforts by the international community to reduce the burden of debt on third would countries to the greatest <Col N="1413" /> extent possible.  The Deputy will see that this is precisely what I have done in my speech to the annual meetings.</P>
    <P>It provides a total of £31.5 million to assist the most heavily indebted poor countries in the world.  The carefully balanced package embraces multilateral and bilateral elements and will also see Ireland honouring its commitment to contribute to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the IMF.  Fifteen million pounds will be provided for multilateral debt relief, £11 million to the World Bank and £4 million to the IMF; £9.5 million has been committed to Mozambique and Tanzania in bilateral debt relief; £7 million will be provided to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, ESAF, of the IMF and £22 million of the package represents new funding for poorer countries and is in addition to the funds already commited in the Overseas Development Assistance Budget.</P>
    <P>At the time, I also announced a set of new principles which will govern Ireland's policy towards Third World debt.  These principles take account of the representations I received from the non-governmental organisations active in this field.  In brief, the principles seek to ensure that debt relief measures take full account of the social dimension, embrace widespread consultation in the countries in question and encourage sustainable economic development.  I strongly advocated these principles during my speech at the IMF/World Bank meeting.</P>
    <P>This issue was discussed at the Interim Committee of the IMF and the Development Committee which is a joint committee of the IMF and the World Bank.  These committees are the principle decision making bodies of the Bretton Woods Institutions.  Both committees strongly endorsed progress under the Debt Initiative.  The communiques issued after both meetings are being placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>The question of ensuring year 2000 compliance is being actively pursued by my Department, in line with a formal plan drawn up last year.  The plan quantified the effort involved in achieving year 2000 compliance in all affected areas of the Department and work is ongoing on its implementation.</P>
      <P>The year 2000 problem can affect computer applications and computer software generally, where calculations are made involving dates which use only two digits to represent the year. Similarly, computer hardware and office equipment with embedded date processing features can be affected.  As part of my Department's plan therefore, remedial action is being taken on all such projects to ensure that they will continue to function properly in the lead up to and after 1 January 2000.  This work is being monitored closely by a year 2000 committee, which reports to me.</P>
      <P>Along with all Government Departments, my Department also makes regular progress reports on this issue to the interdepartmental year 2000 monitoring committee, which was established last year to oversee achievement of year 2000 compliance for IT systems and other office equipment in the Civil Service.  This committee, which is chaired by my Department, reports to Government every two months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 252, 253, 254, 255, 263, 264, 265, 266, 268 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>The role of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to charities is confined to consideration of applications from bodies of persons or trusts claiming exemption from certain taxes on the basis that they are established for charitable purposes only and to operating controls and monitoring, commensurate with the risk to the Exchequer, to ensure that the exemption is not abused.</P>
      <P>In their approach to controls, the Revenue Commissioners have informed me that first, they recognise the important contribution which voluntary organisations make to Irish society and that monitoring controls should not unduly hinder the efforts of those involved, and second, the perceived Exchequer risk from entities granted tax exemption is generally low.  The records maintained by the Revenue Commissioners indicate that the majority of these entities are small, many of them being local organisations operating on a voluntary basis.  The Costello report found that 75 per cent of charities had an annual income of less than £50,000.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that their records indicate that this is still the general picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his 1992 Annual Report, the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on a project audit he had conducted on the treatment of charities by various State agencies.  In relation to the Revenue Commissioners, the Comptroller noted that cost benefit considerations were relevant in deciding on the appropriate level of control and monitoring of bodies granted exemption from tax.  He also identified deficiencies in the approach at that time to monitoring exempt bodies which needed to be addressed.  In his report, the Comptroller accepted, in relation to monitoring the activities of charities, that in order to ensure that the resources to be applied matched the perceived risk, a final decision by the Revenue Commissioners on the extent of review of existing cases should await the results of the examination of a sample of 173 cases selected by them for detailed scrutiny.  Deputy Gormley has asked about the results of the review of these cases.  I am happy to inform the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners have reported that nothing unusual was uncovered in this review and indeed <Col N="1419" /> that compliance with the terms of the exemption was to a high standard.  In seven cases, the review found that the entity granted exemption was no longer active and the exemption in those cases was therefore withdrawn.</P>
    <P>As regards the grant of exemption to an entity from income tax on the grounds that it is established for charitable purposes only, there is a comprehensive application process which must be gone through and stringent conditions apply where exemptions are granted.  The considerations taken into account in deciding cases and the requirements to be fulfilled by applicants are set out in Information Booklet CHY1 entitled &ldquo;Applying for Relief from Tax on the Income and Property of Charities&rdquo;, a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  I should mention that in his 1992 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General noted that the Charities Section of the Revenue Commissioners examined applications for tax exempt status and ensured that the legislative and administrative procedures were complied with before exemption was granted.</P>
    <P>The activities of each entity granted exemption must be the subject of a Governing Instrument covering the non-distribution of income, assets or profits to members; the keeping of comprehensive records of activities undertaken and of annual audited accounts which must be made available to Revenue on request; a prohibition on the payment of fees and-or salaries, other than out-of-pocket expenses to officers or Directors; where the entity is wound up, the transfer of assets to another charitable body, and prior approval of Revenue for any amendment to the Instrument.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they operate controls and monitoring on entities granted exemption, which take account of the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 1992 Annual Report as well as the concerns of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>In its second interim report on the 1992 appropriation accounts, that committee acknowledged that the majority of charities are small but found that there was a need for follow-up to ensure that tax exempt status continued to be justified where the level of funds involved were significant.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners require each entity granted tax exemption as a charity to provide them with a copy of its first year's financial accounts as well as details of activities actually carried out, within 18 months of the grant of exemption.  Bodies with income in excess of £20,000 per annum must submit audited accounts. Unless these requirements are met, exemption is liable to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>A long-term monitoring procedure has also been operated by Revenue since 1988 under which entities granted exemption are selected for review on a risk analysis basis.  In these reviews, Revenue addresses issues such as accumulated <Col N="1420" /> income and, where a charity is dissolved, the distribution of its assets.  Where DIRT-free accounts are operated, the entity holding exemption is obliged by law to furnish a prescribed declaration form to the relevant financial institution confirming its tax-exempt status.  The maintenance of such bank accounts, including details of accumulated income are subject to examination by Revenue in the course of the review.  Over the past three years, Revenue have completed more than 500 long-term reviews of entities granted exemption and they advise me that the reviews disclosed a high standard of compliance with the terms of the exemption.  No cases of serious abuse or of Exchequer losses emerged from the reviews.</P>
    <P>The current number of entities on the Revenue records as holding tax exemption as charities is 6,380.  Many of the charities which are granted exemptions are small voluntary organisations and some of them lapse over time.  Where, over the years, Revenue become aware that an entity granted exemption had ceased activity, it withdrew the exemption.  Early this year Revenue commenced a special project to identify all those charities granted exemption which are no longer in existence.  This project is still ongoing and so far it has identified more than 1,000 defunct charities.  The number of active tax exempt charities is believed by Revenue to be less than 5,000.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will be pleased to learn that the Revenue Commissioners intend to make public a list of charitable exempt bodies shortly.</P>
    <P>An entity whose primary objective is works of a charitable nature beneficial to the community may qualify for exemption under the tax code as a body of persons or a trust established for charitable purposes only.  The kind of activities typically qualifying for exemption under this heading are improvements to a town or local area, protection of the environment, neighbourhood watch schemes and so on.  Political parties or bodies fund-raising for political purposes would not qualify for exemption under this heading or for charitable exemption generally.</P>
    <P>It is possible that there may be some confusion between the provisions in the tax code for the grant of exemption to charitable entities and the wholly separate provision in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Act, 1976, which provides in section 54 for exemption from Capital Acquisitions Tax for a gift or inheritance taken for public or charitable purposes, to the extent that the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that it has been or will be applied for such purposes.  A gift or inheritance taken by a political party would qualify for exemption from Capital Acquisitons Tax under that section on the grounds that it was applied for public purposes.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that they are not aware of any entity holding tax exemption as a charity which is engaged in political fund-raising.  I would invite any Deputy who may have any information to the contrary to provide details to Revenue so that the matter may be inquired into. <Col N="1421" /> Having regard to the control and monitoring of tax exempt charities carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, which I have outlined, I am satisfied that the relevant exemption is administered in an appropriate and balanced way which meets the concerns expressed by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 1992 annual report, as well as responding to the findings of the Public Accounts Committee in its second interim report on the 1992 Appropriation Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first £4,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years and in respect of £6,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years.  The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming.</P>
      <P>These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees.  In this context, &ldquo;qualifying lessee&rdquo; specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives.  A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife.  A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendent.  The restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be open to manipulation with spurious arrangements being set up, such as the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed by both.</P>
      <P>There are generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale.  For all these reasons, I do not propose to provide an exemption from income tax from a farm land lease entered into between related persons whether for the purposes of the early retirement scheme or generally.</P>
      <P>On the question of equity the Deputy should note that no other category of taxpayer benefit from tax exempt income from leased land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has consistently supported the evolution of both the IMF and the World Bank group to meet their responsibilities in the face of a changing world environment and better understanding of what makes for stability, sustainable growth and development.  In particular Ireland has supported greater transparency in the activities of the institutions and of their member countries and an increasing focus on social and civic aspects of programmes, in particular, targeting poverty reduction, which is the overarching aim of the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Recent crises have thrown into sharp relief a number of other aspects of these institutions which need to be addressed.  These include: (i) adequacy of funding, particularly for the IMF; (ii) speed of response to situations which are in the current situation changing very quickly; (iii) increased collaboration between the institutions, both in areas where their functions overlap, such as financial sector reform and where they are complementary, such as macro-economic stabilisation for the IMF and structural development for the World Bank; (iv) involvement of and ownership by, as broad a spectrum of stakeholders as possible in individual countries of these countries' stabilisation and development programmes.  We have consistently put our views to the institutions, through our participation at ministerial level, at the annual meetings, through the relevant ministerial committees, interim and development, and through the board of executive directors.  We have also facilitated feedback from NGOs working in the field, at all levels of the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent proposals for reform have highlighted the areas mentioned above and we have supported these reforms at various levels.  Most recently in my speech to the annual meetings, I stressed the need to strengthen the IMF's role in crisis prevention and called for the international financial institutions to redouble their efforts to bring stability to the global financial and monetary system, but I also made it clear that I <Col N="1425" /> expected that the most vulnerable groups in society should be protected and that the private sector must bear its fair share of the overall burden of adjustment.</P>
    <P>In brief, the Government is not putting forward separate additional proposals for reform of these institutions; we are supporting those proposals which are already on the table.  In this regard I refer the Deputy to my speech to the annual meetings and the communiqués of the interim and development committees of these institutions. I have put these documents in the Library.  They can also be accessed at the Internet sites of the IMF and World Bank.  These sites are continuing to reflect a policy of increased openness in the running of the institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 278, 280, 287 and 289 together.</P>
      <P>As a small open economy, the inflation rate in Ireland is heavily influenced by the level of inflatin in our trading partners and by exchange rate movements.  The upturn in CPI inflation in Ireland over the first half of this year largely reflects the strength of the currencies of our major trading partners and in particular sterling last year.  This gave rise to a temporary increase in inflation in Ireland as higher import prices fed through into the prices of exchange rate sensitive traded goods.  It is also likely to have impacted indirectly on non-traded goods and services prices in the economy reflecting the spillover from price increases in traded good inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent movements in the effective trade weighted exchange rate, EER, is expected to <Col N="1427" /> alleviate upward pressure on prices.  My Department's most recent inflation forecast &mdash; published in <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i>, ERO, in July &mdash; was for an annual increase of 2.75 per cent in 1998 and an inflation rate of between 2 and 2.5 per cent in 1999 depending on the evolution of exchange rates.  More recent indications are that the 1998 outturn may be somewhat lower than forecasted in ERO and with the progressive unwinding of sterling strength inflation seems set to decline towards 2 per cent in 1999.</P>
    <P>The European Commission's autumn economic forecasts highlight inflation as the main treatment to the sustainability of Ireland's remarkable economic performance.  However, the Commission also pointed out that the risk of higher inflation is lessened by the strong growth potential of the Irish economy.  The gap which now exists between Irish inflation and inflation in the euro zone as a whole largely reflects low inflation rates now being recorded in such countries as Germany and France rather than a sharp and sustained deterioration in our inflation performance.</P>
    <P>The 1999 budget will have as one of its primary objectives &mdash; against the backdrop of Ireland's membership of EMU from 1 January next &mdash; the achievement of low inflation and the maintenance of Ireland's international competitiveness. The need to maintain low and stable inflation in the economy is a critical element of the Government's medium-term strategy for achieving continued economic and social progress.  This will require a continuation of the range of policies which have helped secure the exceptional performance of the economy in recent years, in particular pay moderation under social partnership, prudent budgetary policies and the maintenance of appropriate levels of investment in the economy's physical infrastructure and human capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 279, 282 and 286 together.</P>
      <P>Economic forecasts indicate that the outlook for jobs expansion, and the maintenance of Irish competitiveness in markets abroad and as an investment location, remains broadly favourable. For the fifth successive year, the remarkable growth performance of the Irish economy continued in 1998.  GDP and employment are estimated to have risen strongly again.  Despite strong economic growth, inflation has remained moderate.  The outlook for 1999 is for further strong growth in output and employment, despite a less favourable international economic environment. Inflation is also likely to continue to be moderate.  Ireland's relatively youthful population, and our educated labour force, our future participation in the euro and our continuing successful economic performance should help to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as an investment location.</P>
      <P>While the outlook is broadly positive, there are challenges to be faced.  The outlook for inflation is moderate, but there is no room for complacency. Inflationary pressures could emerge if wages growth accelerates, thereby damaging the competitiveness of Irish goods and services and our attractiveness as an investment location. There are some signs of wage pressures in the economy.  We must be vigilant to ensure pay moderation continues to be the norm.</P>
      <P>The intensification of world competition for trade and investment is likely to increase difficulties for the maintenance of our shares in these areas.  This challenge will be compounded by the impact of increased competition in the EU with the launch of the euro.  We must remain dedicated to maintaining competitiveness and meeting these challenges.</P>
      <P>Under EMU, Ireland's monetary policy will be determined by the European Central Bank, having regard to monetary conditions prevailing the euro zone as a whole.  There will be no prospect of using an exchange rate or interest rate instrument to cushion shocks that affect Ireland and hence our competitiveness.  We must therefore be resourceful in use of other instruments that remain under our domestic control.  Consequently, fiscal, income and structural policies in 1999 will play a greater role than hitherto in maintaining competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adjustment will primarily be through these policies: the Government is determined that expenditure policies, both in 1999 and the medium term, will continue to be disciplined and continues to be committed to reducing the burden of personal income tax in order to reward effort and to improve incentives to work.  The maintenance of Ireland's attractiveness as an investment location and the continuation of sustainable economic growth require substantial investment in infrastructure and skills.  In recognition of this capital spending is to increase substantially in 1999, with major investments in, <i>inter</i><Col N="1429" /><i>alia</i>, roads and rail infrastructure and education. Electricity and telecommunications costs to business users have become much more competitive in recent years.  The market for telecommunications infrastructure was liberalised on 1 July 1997. The market for voice telephony services will be fully liberalised from 1 December 1998.  From this date, any operator will be free to compete on an equal basis in any sector of the telecommunications market.  The Competitiveness Council will continue to report on all key aspects of competitiveness, with recommendations on policy actions required.  The Government will continue to work closely with the social partners in managing the economy, in reducing any emerging inflationary pressures through a continuation of a responsible approach to wage development and in participating successfully in EMU.  The negotiation in 1999 of a successor agreement to Partnership 2000 will be an important priority for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my first budget last year, I introduced a tax initiative to help the long-term unemployed which is now titled job assist.  This is a two part initiative which provides an incentive for a long-term unemployed person to take up employment, and also provides an incentive for employers to employ a long-term unemployed person.  The first part of the initiative provides a special tax deduction in the first year of employment of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each child for persons unemployed for one year or more who take up a job.  The allowance is tapered over a three year period.  An employee availing of the scheme also retains his or her medical card entitlement for three years and other secondary benefits are retained also for three years where income earned is less than £250 a week.  To be eligible under the scheme a long-term unemployed individual must have been unemployed for at least 12 months and in receipt of either an unemployment payment, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, or the one-parent family allowance from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs. In certain circumstances, time spent on certain activities, programmes or courses for the unemployed can be taken into account for calculating the 12 months mentioned above.  Up to the beginning of October 1998, 767 persons had availed of this new scheme.</P>
      <P>The income tax and PRSI system is structured to ensure employment will be attractive to the lower paid.  The annual single person's tax free allowance and PAYE allowance combined amount to £3,950, which means that an employee can earn £76 per week before tax is payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> Where exemption limits apply, a single person can earn £78.85 per week before tax is payable. The threshold for payment of the health and employment and training levies means that employees earning £207 per week or less will not have to pay the health and employment and training levies.  The first £100 of weekly earnings is free of employee PRSI.  The reduction in the standard rate of tax &mdash; from 26 per cent to 24 per cent in my first budget last year &mdash; has also enhanced the incentive to take up low paid employment.</P>
    <P>These measures are in addition to benefits and schemes operated by other Departments.  Of these, the family income supplement, FIS, operated by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is of particular benefit for single earner households with children, where the earner is in low paid employment.  Following a change announced in budget 1998, FIS is now calculated on the basis of net income, that is net of income tax and PRSI, which will further improve the attractiveness of employment for the relevant target group.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, recognises the need to reduce the burden of personal taxation in order to reward effort and give people an incentive to take up work.  I have already signalled the need to focus tax changes on benefiting the lower and middle income groups.  The taxation measures which I will bring forward in next month's budget will make further improvements in this regard.</P>

      <P>The latest economic forecasts from the EU Commission suggest that Ireland's GDP will grow by 8.2 per cent in 1999, while the OECD foresees growth of the order of 6.7 per cent next year.  If either forecast proves accurate, Ireland would seem likely <Col N="1431" /> to again achieve the highest rate of growth among EU member states.  While these assessments indicate a view that we are well placed to take advantage of the benefits of economic and monetary union, we are not complacent.  We are aware of the need to maintain the competitiveness of the economy in all its aspects, in order to build on the impressive economic and employment growth of recent years.</P>

      <P>I understand from data supplied from the Revenue Commissioners that, to the end of October 1998, the number of second-hand cars registered in the State was 31,708 as compared to 32,328 for the same period last year.  The number of such registrations has dropped slightly in recent years.  This figure has to be seen against sales of 138,280 new cars to end of October 1998, up from 120,932 for the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The data which the Revenue Commissioners have in relation to exports refers to the temporary ZZ registration number which is required where an unregistered car, new or second-hand, is purchased in the State by a person established outside the State and is used temporarily in the State prior to or <i>en route</i> to exportation.  The number of such temporary registrations issued up <Col N="1433" /> to 30 September 1998 was 18,998 as compared to 8,255 for the same period last year.  The growth in the number of ZZ registrations appears to be due to an increase in the export from here to the UK of cars previously registered in Japan.  No data is readily to hand of the numbers of cars &mdash; new or second-hand &mdash; which are driven from the State by motor dealers using their trade plates or are shipped out on car-transporters.</P>
    <P>There may be a number of factors which affect the export of second-hand cars from the State as such.  These may include the relative range and choice of second-hand cars in the State <i>vis-à-vis</i> those available in, for example, the United Kingdom, where there is a higher ratio of car ownership as well as higher car fleet ownership. The fact that the UK has had for many years an MOT test may also militate against imports into that country from the State, although, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will announce shortly the contractor for the operation of car testing here.</P>
    <P>VRT is a valuable source of funding to the State.  It has brought in nearly £450 million to end October this year.  The tax is imposed on first registration in the State.  It is not intended as a tax or subsidy for imports or exports of vehicles.</P>

      <P>Current policy towards the care of older people is guided by the Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly, which was published in 1988.  The cornerstone of this policy is to support people at home in dignity and independence and when this is no longer possible to ensure that ill and dependent older people have access to the highest quality hospital and residential care when they require it.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which is the statutory advisory group set up to advise the Government on all matters affecting older people, published a comprehensive review of how policy is being implemented.  This review identified a number of service areas where improvements are required, particularly community support for older people and their carers.  It is my intention to address these issues, on a phased basis, as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, additional resources have been provided to develop community support services. For example, professional support staff have been appointed by the Eastern Health Board to work with older people in their homes.  These are known as community ward teams and they facilitate the early planned discharge of older people <Col N="1434" /> from acute general hospitals by the provision of rehabilitation and care in the person's home. They also prevent, or delay, the admission of older people to long stay care and enhance other service supports including public health nursing, day care, carer support and respite services.</P>
    <P>In 1998, the capital programme for older people has been more than doubled which will enable an additional 200 day care places and 30 respite places to be put in place.</P>
    <P>In relation to mental handicap services a range of support services are provided by both the health boards and voluntary mental handicap services to assist carers of persons with a mental handicap, including respite care and home support services.  Respite care is provided in a number of ways.  In some cases it is provided in a residential setting and in others it is also provided by host families through the various &ldquo;Share a Break&rdquo; schemes.</P>
    <P>The home support services were initiated in 1992 with the purpose of providing additional support to carers where persons with a mental handicap were either waiting for placements in either day or residential services or wished to continue to live with their families.  The response to the services from both carers and agencies has been very positive as these services enable agencies to respond to individual family's needs in a flexible manner and with a package of care which is designed in consultation with the carers.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional funding was provided between 1990-8 for the development of new services to persons with a mental handicap and includes investment in respite care services and enhancement of the home support services.  These services will continue to be expanded in line with the needs identified in Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap &mdash; 1997-2001</P>
    <P>As set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  With regard to the provision of health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, this commitment comprehends the implementation of the recommendations set out in Towards an Independent Future.  I am satisfied that the additional money made available to date by this Government represents a major step towards implementing the recommendations of the report.  More than £19 million has been provided in the past 12 months for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>I fully accept the need to provide greater support for carers and this is being actively considered in the context of the availability of additioal resources in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for the provision of routine educational psychological assessments for school children is a matter in the first instance for the Department of Education and Science.  As the psychological services provided by the Department of Education and Science to primary schools are still in the development stage and are at present limited to a small number of schools, health boards currently provide some services for school children on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.  The primary concern, however, of the health funded psychological services is to provide assessment and therapeutic treatment to children, adolescents and their families who present with a wide range of emotional, behavioural and psychological difficulties and developmental delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will clearly take time for the National Educational Psychological Service, recently announced by the Minister for Education and Science, to build up an increased level of service provision to children of schoolgoing age.  During this interim period the health-funded services will continue to work with the developing educational psychological services to ensure that the available resources are applied as effectively as possible Nevertheless, their first concern must remain, as <Col N="1436" /> outlined above, the provision of the therapeutic psychological assessment and treatment services.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 303 together.</P>
      <P>The national casemix programme of the Department of Health and Children collects information in relation to both hospital activity, and its associated costs, in a limited number of public hospitals who participate in casemix.  Information in relation to private consultants, operating in private hospitals, is not collected by my Department.</P>
      <P>All casemix public hospital activity is grouped together, for statistical analysis, and is not broken down between medical card patients and any other type of patient; or between patients in public or private beds.</P>
      <P>Casemix, which involves the monitoring and comparison of costs and activity between hospitals, classifies patients into discrete classes or groups, which share common clinical attributes and similar patterns of resource use.  The system presently in use in Ireland categorises activity into 495 diagnosis related groups, (DRG's).  DRG 209 relates to major joint and limb reattachment procedures of the lower extremity, including total, partial and revised hip, knee and ankle replacements.  Casemix estimates an average cost per case for all cases in each DRG, but does not break down costs to the level of individual procedures. Costs are averaged over all hospitals in the casemix programme, rather than by individual hospital, in order to produce meaningful national data.</P>
      <P>The casemix data for 1996, the latest date for which information is available, indicates that the average cost of a hip replacement is £4,378.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 300 and 301 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of health services in the County Mayo area is a matter for the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>The board has advised me that a community nursing unit for older people in Ballinrobe would be intended to serve an immediate catchment area of 15,000-20,000 population.  The proportion of older persons within that general population would be approximately 2,200 to 3,000 based on an average of 15 per cent of the population.  The board considers that a unit incorporating rehabilitation, convalescence, respite, day hospital, welfare and long-stay would service the needs of the area.</P>
      <P>A site in Ballinrobe town was acquired by the board some years ago for this purpose.  I understand that the board is currently preparing a priority list in relation to the provision of new community nursing units and the adaptation of existing units and that the Ballinrobe project will be considered in that context.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the board's priority proposals for the development of community nursing units will be fully considered by me as soon as these are received in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has been involved in a number of studies which have been carried out in order to establish the smoking prevalence rates among school children.</P>
      <P>In 1995, my Department supported the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs, ESPAD.  The results of this study indicated that Ireland had a lifetime smoking prevalence among all students of 74 per cent meaning that 74 per cent of students smoked at least once with 41 per cent having smoked in the previous 30 days.  Earlier this year, my Department also commissioned a national lifestyle survey, SLAN, in which young people were participants. This survey will provide more recent statistics in relation to smoking and young people.  The results will be available to me shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition to research, the health promotion unit of my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, has developed a comprehensive substance abuse prevention programme, SAPP, which includes the issue of tobacco.  Available research indicates that the issue of tobacco use by young people is most effectively dealt with when it is part of a broad based social, personal and health education programme and the substance abuse prevention programme conforms to this approach.  This programme is currently being extended to primary schools.  The unit has also developed a smoking cessation reduction action programme for young people which complements the materials available in the SAPP programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that each year the health promotion unit of my Department conducts a national multi-media anti-smoking campaign to discourage smoking and these campaigns frequently target young people.  Details of a new campaign are currently being finalised by the health promotion unit of my Department in association with the Irish Cancer Society and the health boards.  In addition, the unit continues to <Col N="1439" /> provide very comprehensive information materials in relation to smoking and smoking cessation and these are freely available to all members of the public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The charges for private orthodontic treatment are determined by the market.  There is some evidence to suggest that charges for orthodontic treatment obtained privately in Northern Ireland are lower than here but for comparisons to be valid like treatment must be compared with like and all factors contributing to variations in costs would need to be evaluated.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.  Children are assessed, therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department, to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to the orthodontic services including the guidelines. This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health boards in the near future.</P>

      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services. In 1998 a further £8 million revenue has been made available to strengthen child care services. This includes £500,000 for the continued implementation by the health boards of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which give effect to the provisions of Part VII, in regard to pre-school services.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, pre-school providers are obliged to notify their local health board that they are carrying on or proposing to carry on a pre-school service.  On receipt of notification the health board will provide relevant information to the applicant and arrange for an inspection to be carried out by an authorised person.  All pre-school services should be inspected by mid-1999. Inspections will take place annually thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pre-inspection teams are now in place in all health board areas and have started to inspect facilities on a phased basis.  The latest information provided to my Department by the health boards indicates that 2,624 notifications have been received nationally.  A breakdown by indivdual health boards is set out below.  Approximately one-third of these facilities have been inspected. <Col N="1441" /><Col N="1442" /></P>

    <P>A working group to monitor the implementation of Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, is in place.  The group is representative of all the health boards and is concerned with ensuring a consistent approach to the implementation of the regulations.  It is intended that the operation of the regulations will be reviewed after three years, with a view to effecting any changes considered necessary at that stage.  As a first step in this process, I recently initiated a review of the inspection process through the working group.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to expanding the availability of child care.  In this regard, an expert group on child care has been established under Partnership 2000 to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector.  The group, which is chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is expected to finalise its report in December 1998.</P>

      <P>The so-called millennium bug has the potential to adversely affect a wide range of systems and electronically controlled equipment within my Department and in the wider health service.  In view of this, I have put a range of measures in place to deal with the millennium bug issue.  A high level year 2000 monitoring committee chaired by an Assistant Secretary has been put in place to oversee progress in the wider health service and to oversee progress on my Department's internal systems.</P>
      <P>I have embarked on a number of initiatives in order to ensure that health agencies resolve their year 2000 problems in good time.  Initially, year 2000 guidelines were circulated setting out a series of steps to be taken to achieve compliance. Another initiative was the setting up of special interest groups in a number of areas, such as IT, medical devices and estates.  New initiatives include setting up a central test resource for medical devices and a year 2000 Internet site.  My Department is also closely monitoring progress and cost estimates within agencies.</P>
      <P>Staff in the internal systems unit of my Department have been carrying out remedial work for some time on the in-house systems and equipment and I am confident that no significant adverse effects will arise.</P>

      <P>Owing to the high cost of fixed appliance orthodontic therapy, health boards can only provide this treatment where a child has a handicapping orthodontic condition.  Children are assessed, therefore, in accordance with guidelines drawn up by my Department, to ensure that resources are used to best advantage and for those most affected or handicapped.</P>
      <P>At the suggestion of my Department, an orthodontic review group has been set up by the health boards to examine a range of issues in relation to the orthodontic services including the guidelines.  This group, which includes health board consultant orthodontists, is due to report to the chief executive officers of the health board in the near future.</P>
      <P>The objective of this review is to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards having regard to the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years under the dental health action plan for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>This year the acute hospitals' letters of determination included a specific allocation in respect of priority medical equipment.  In the case of Beaumont Hospital, a sum of £0.630 million has been provided for this purpose.  I have made inquiries of the hospital and it has confirmed that the purchase of a second echo machine for the hospitals cardiology department was not included in its list of priorities for funding in 1998.  If this item is prioritised by the hospital for funding in 1999, it will fall to be considered in the context of its overall priorities for capital funding and the many competing demands within the acute hospital sector.</P>

      <P>Under the Health Services (In-Patient) Regulations, 1991, a private patient being admitted to a public hospital as an elective admission shall not be accommodated in a designated public bed.</P>
      <P>However, a private patient being admitted to hospital as an emergency admission shall be accommodated in a designated public bed if, and only for such time as, a designated private bed is not available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Health (In-Patient Charges) Regulations, 1987, as amended by the Health (In-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997, a <Col N="1449" /> person is liable for a statutory charge unless otherwise exempt, in respect of in-patient public hospital services.  The current charge of £25 in respect of each day during which a person is maintained up to a maximum of £250 is applicable to both public and private patients.  In addition, private and semi-private maintenance charges are applicable to private patients accommodated in designated private beds.</P>
    <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, removed the entitlement to combine public and private elements of in-patient care at the same time.  The position now is that every patient is entitled to full public hospital services including public accommodation and public consultant care. Alternatively one can opt to be the private patient of both the consultant and the hospital. Where a patient chooses to be a private patient, then he-she is liable for consultant fees even when, for reasons of lack of availability of a private bed, he-she has to, as an emergency admission, occupy a public bed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-Eastern Health Board provides financial assistance both to the national headquarters of the Mental Health Association in Dublin and to various branches of the association in its functional area.

      <P>Where such cases arise, the third level fees will be paid in respect of the academic year which the student is required to repeat.  In addition, the student will receive a maintenance grant of up to 50 per cent of the value of the annual maintenance grant normally payable to students in respect of the repeat year.  These arrangements are in respect of a single repeat year only.</P>

      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of these services over a five year period and estimated the cost at £50 million over the period.</P>
      <P>Two of the review group's recommendations are crucial to the future development of services in this sector.  These are the establishment of regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disability services in each health board and the establishment of a database of service needs in the sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> The co-ordinating committees, which comprise representatives of the voluntary and statutory agencies and people with disabilities themselves, have been established and they function in a consultative and advisory capacity to the chief executive officers of the health boards in identifying and prioritising service developments and the allocation of available funding for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Following a successful pilot project in three health boards, my Department is in the process of establishing a national committee to develop the database.  The database will provide the basis for the accurate identification and quantification of service needs for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of 1997, the previous Government made available an additional £3.688 million revenue for the maintenance and development of the services.  In its first six months in office, this Government allocated £10 million by way of once-off funding to address immediate and pressing problems in the sector namely the provision of aids and appliances and the elimination of deficits of the voluntary agencies providing services. This year, a further £8.4 million has been allocated comprising £5.4 million additional revenue and £3 million for capital projects.  Of the £5.4 million revenue, £3 million has been specifically earmarked for the development of services in the sector.</P>
    <P>As set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, this Government is committed to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  With regard to the provision of health services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, this commitment comprehends the implementation of the recommendations set out in Towards an Independent Future.  I am satisfied that the additional money made available to date by this Government represents a major step towards implementing the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Government's commitments under Partnership 2000, services in the physical and sensory disability sector will continue to be developed to the extent permitted by the availability of development funding.  I cannot say at this time what funding will be made available until after the budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 336 together.</P>
      <P>In June 1998, the Environment Council adopted a common position on a proposed directive on the landfill of waste.  The proposed directive is subject to co-operation, between Council and the European Parliament, and cannot enter into force until the relevant procedures under Article 189c of the Treaty on European Union are completed.  Member states will be required to ensure the implementation of the directive not later than two years after its entry into force.</P>
      <P>The proposed directive will require member states to ensure that all costs involved in the setting up and operation of a landfill facility, and the estimated costs of closure and aftercare, are covered by the price charged by the operator for the disposal of waste at that facility.</P>
      <P>The operational and technical requirements provided for in the proposed directive have been anticipated by the comprehensive waste licensing system operated by the EPA under the Waste Management Act, 1996.  Under the Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997, landfill facilities are licensable by the EPA on a phased basis in the period from 1 May 1997 to 1 March 1999.  All landfill facilities, other than local authority facilities where the annual intake does not exceed 5,000 tonnes, are currently licensable; remaining facilities become licensable on 1 March 1999.  It will be a matter for the relevant local authority to apply for a waste licence in respect of any such facility which it proposes to continue in operation after that date.  Information on costs involved in compliance with EPA licensing requirements is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>Policy in relation to waste management is outlined in the recently published policy statement, Changing our Ways, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.</P>

      <P>The construction industry has the primary responsibility to ensure the environmentally <Col N="1455" /> sound management of construction and demolition, C&amp;D, waste.  My Department will shortly engage in consultation with the construction sector with a view to the early development of voluntary measures which will meet the Government's objectives for the recovery of C&amp;D waste. As indicated in the recent policy statement on waste management &mdash; Changing our Ways &mdash; mandatory producer responsibility obligations under the Waste Management Act, 1996 and-or measures very substantially to increase the cost of disposing of C&amp;D waste to landfill are alternatives to be activated within two years in the absence of appropriate voluntary industryled initiatives.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 348, 354, 357 and 360 together.</P>
      <P>Section 194 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, provides for the award of double child benefit payments in respect of a qualified child whose birth was part of a multiple birth of three or more children.  This provision was first introduced in the Social Wefare Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>Prior to the last election, we gave a commitment to increase the level of child benefit payable for twins.  Section 194, as amended by section 6 of the Social Welfare Act, 1998, now provides that the rate of child benefit payable in respect of a qualified child, whose birth was part of a multiple birth of two children, will be 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that I introduced this latter measure, which came into effect in September of this year, in recognition of the additional difficulties which may be faced by parents of twins, thereby fulfilling my election commitments. The full-year cost of this measure amounts to some £4.8 million.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of representations on the question of equalising the rates of child benefit payable in respect of twins and of children whose birth was part of a multiple birth of three or more children.</P>

    <P>The question of providing for any further enhancement of the arrangements for twins <Col N="1461" /> under the child benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, in the light of the resources available and of other competing priorities.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 350 and 351 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This funding is provided by way of a grant to voluntary groups and organisations, such as the group mentioned in the Deputy's question, which has undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.  When the scheme was originally established in 1996 it was considered that voluntary groups and organisations working closely with older people in the community were well-placed to identify those in the community in need of assistance under the scheme.  To date, my Department has provided <Col N="1462" /> funding to some 1,300 voluntary organisations who have participated in the scheme and is currently processing applications for some 940 groups who have applied under this year's scheme.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million was allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  A review of applications under the 1998 scheme indicated that some 940 applications had been received.  Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million.  The allocation of these additional funds will allow the Department to assist a large number of people again this year and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications.  They expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July last year this Government has spent £10 million on the scheme as opposed to £2 million spent on it by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, the Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how it is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>There is currently one legislative measure which remains to be transposed into Irish law by my Department.  This is Council Directive 98/49/EC on safeguarding the supplementary pension rights of employed and self employed persons moving within the Community, which was adopted on 29 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The directive primarily deals with the preservation of benefits, disclosure of information and payment of occupational pensions across borders for workers who move from one member state to another.  It also provides for workers who are posted abroad to be allowed to stay in their occupational schemes and to be exempt from joining such a scheme in the country to which they are posted.</P>
      <P>Member states are required to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative arrangements necessary to comply with the directive not later than 25 July 2001.  My Department is actively engaged with the Pensions Board in bringing forward the legislative or regulatory changes that may be required to implement the directive.</P>

      <P>The Pensions Board report &ldquo;Securing Retirement Income&rdquo;, on the National Pensions Policy Initiative, for which Dr. Bacon provided consultancy, is a comprehensive and detailed document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of the Government response to the report as set out in &ldquo;Action on Pensions&rdquo;, published when the report was launched in May, working groups have been set up as follows: (a) to examine fully the recommendation for an explicit fund to minimise the additional, future costs of social welfare pensions; (b) to progress the recommendation to increase second pillar coverage and the mechanism suggested for achieving this &mdash; namely, the personal retirement savings account; the Government has accepted this finding, in principle, and the working group is currently <Col N="1464" /> examining the issues involved with a view to appropriate legislation being introduced; (c) to further examine and advance the proposals to introduce a simplified and more flexible tax regime for pensions.  Again, this was also accepted, in principle, by the Government and the third working group is considering this matter with a view to making the necessary legislative changes.  This group is also examining issues relating to annuity purchase and the question of an earnings cap in relation to tax relief on pensions; and (d) to bring forward proposals in relation to an effective awareness-education programme. Again, the Government is deeply supportive of the proposals in this regard.  The importance of clear and easily understandable information in the pensions area cannot be underestimated.  I expect to receive an initial report on this from the Pensions Board by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government also accepted the board's proposals for legislative changes in relation to access, vesting, preservation, revaluation and integration.</P>
    <P>In am committed to implementing the proposals in the report as quickly as possible. However, I am also of the opinion that this must be done by way of a considered approach and I hope to publish a comprehensive Pensions Bill in the last quarter of 1999, with a view to enactment during 2000.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance are available to people living in the State, aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment and to certain people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.</P>
      <P>In addition, widows-widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the free schemes retain that entitlement.  This is to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes were originally designed to benefit mainly older people in receipt of a social welfare type payment who were living alone and required additional assistance.  However, over the years, additional categories of people have been included. <Col N="1465" /> It is proposed to undertake a fundamental review of the free schemes, commencing in early 1999, to assess whether the objectives of these schemes are being achieved in the most efficient and effective manner and the Deputy's proposal will be examined as part of this review process.</P>

      <P>The 1998 budget provided for a special increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payment for some 270,000 pensioners aged 66 and over, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for a further 54,000 pensioners on reduced rate contributory pensions.  These increases marked a considerable first step in meeting the commitment in the Government's action programme to increase the old age contributory pension to £100 per week by the year 2002.  In addition, qualified adult allowances were increased by 3 per cent in general giving actual increases of between £1.20 and £1.50.</P>
      <P>The question of future increases in social welfare payments, including the level of increases for old age pensioners and qualified adults, is a matter for consideration by the Government in a budgetary context in the light of available resources and having regard to the commitments contained in the Government programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.</P>

    <P>Having reviewed the level of demand under the scheme this year I recently sought, and obtained, Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme, bringing the total allocation in 1998 to £5 million. The allocation of these additional funds will allow my Department to assist a large number of people again this year and the regional offices of my Department are currently processing applications.  They expect to be in a position soon to advise groups of the decision regarding their applications.</P>
    <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met. While preliminary figures suggest that additional funding would be required to fund all applications at the 90 per cent level it is expected that, as in previous years, the final demands under the scheme will be less than the initial preliminary figures would indicate.  Therefore, I am satisfied that the current level of funding is sufficient to allow my Department to make a meaningful response to worthwhile applications and to assist a large number of people again this year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that since its inception in 1996 a total of £12 million has been made available for this scheme and up to the end of 1997 some 36,000 people had been assisted by the scheme.  It is anticipated that in excess of a further 20,000 people will be assisted this year.  This means that since I came into office in July last year this Government has spent £10 million on that scheme as opposed to £2 million spent on it by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that this scheme addresses the security needs of the most vulnerable people and that it provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review <Col N="1467" /> of the scheme which will consider how it is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

      <P>Arising from concerns expresssed about the needs of low income farm families, I met with representatives of farm organisations to explore the potential within the social welfare system of providing income support to farmers on low incomes.  The position of low income farmers without children is being considered in the context of these ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that under existing arrangements, smallholders whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance (UA) appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA.  In the context of the difficulties facing farmers affected by the recent bad season, a number of improvements are being introduced so as to increase access to the scheme by low income farmers.</P>
      <P>For instance, farmers already on the scheme are being encouraged to come forward for reassessment of means; efforts are being intensified to increase awareness of the scheme and to emphasise its applicability to farmers; and in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food, the means assessment procedure is being reviewed to ensure that it takes full account of the recent deterioration in farm incomes.</P>

      <P>My Department agreed to pay an annual administration grant for a five-year period to the Hunt Museum to assist it in its initial years of operations.  This arrangement was conditional on the museum meeting certain conditions laid down by both my Department and Shannon Development, including the projected spending parameters for the museum.  At present my Department is not satisfied that these conditions are being met and accordingly, no payment of the grant has as yet been made in 1998.  However, a meeting is to be arranged shortly involving the Hunt Museum, Shannon Development and my Department to clarify the elements of a new business plan being drawn up by the museum.</P>

      <P>Equal opportunities is one of the four pillars of the EU Employment Guidelines, which were adopted in December, 1997. The guidelines invite member states, <i>inter alia,</i> to <Col N="1478" /> increase the percentage of women at work, to eliminate the obstacles in the way of their return to work and to raise the levels of access to care services including child care.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Child Care Programme which is designed to support local communities and employers who are trying to facilitate women and men who have child care responsibilities while accessing training, education and employment. It is targeted particularly at parents in disadvantaged areas and those on low pay who cannot access training, education and employment opportunities due to lack of affordable good quality child care.  In July of this year I announced expenditure of £5.2 million on this programme, including EU funding, over the 1998-99 period. This funding is being provided to the following three initiatives:</P>
      <P>Capital Infrastructure: Money is being targeted at community child care projects to enable them to upgrade-enhance their facilities or establish new purpose built facilities for women and men who need child care while they are at work or availing of training (90 Community Projects in receipt of funding).</P>
      <P>Core Funding: This fund is being used to provide support to meet the expenditure required for full-time senior child care works in community child care projects with a focus on equal opprotunities and disadvantage (25 Flagship Projects in receipt of funding).</P>
      <P>Employer Demonstration Child Care Initiative: This is being developed in partnership with IBEC to stimulate employer interest and involvement in supporting equal opportunity child care facilities (21 companies, forming eight consortiums, in receipt of funding).</P>
      <P>The EU element of the funding is one million ecus with the decision in principle to provide a further 1 million ECUs.</P>
      <P>In addition, a child care database is being established by my Department in conjunction with Area Development Management Limited to document and quantify the range and extent of childcare provision and training being supported under the Community Support Framework (EU Regional and Social Funds) and to establish baseline data on other facilities-services in child care being supported by the State.  EU funding of 144,875 ECUs is being provided for this project together with State funding of £38,327 (equivalent of 48,292 ECUs).</P>
      <P>Child care is an outcome of other policy objectives in a range of EU programmes and initiatives. These are: Human Resources O.P. and Local, Rural and Urban Development O.P.</P>
      <P>Community Initiatives: Leader, Urban, Employment and Interreg.</P>
      <P>Funding is also provided to the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some difficulty in isolating the level of EU funding which goes towards child care provision <Col N="1479" /> at present.  This issue is being addressed through the childcare database, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The development of a national childcare infrastructure currently under consideration by the Expert Working Group on childcare which is chaired by my Department is intended to form the basis for demands for EU funding in the context of the next round of Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the strong local support for the pool in Castlebar.  However, the total provision in this year's Estimates of £4 million for the construction and refurbishment of swimming pools, is fully committed to projects under construction or to projects already approved and on which work is expected to commence shortly.  In addition, there are over £40 million worth of projects (including Castlebar), at various stages of planning, which are also seeking funding.  Therefore, as formal approval of contract documents and permission to go to tender can only be given when the necessary funding for the project is available, I cannot give approval at this time, to the proposals for refurbishment of the pool in Castlebar.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated previously, my Department has no statutory functions in respect of controls and safety standards for sport and recreation facilities, or for industry relating to such facilities.  Responsibility for these matters lies primarily with the organisers of events or activities, and with the management of premises and stadia used for sporting purposes, particularly with regard to compliance with fire safety legislation and building regulations dealt with by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Matters of public order, of course, are a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education facilitated the preparation and publication in January 1996, of detailed, and comprehensive, codes of practice for safety at sports grounds and at outdoor pop concerts for the guidance of organisers and ground administrators.</P>
      <P>The codes were prepared by a working party, chaired by a senior local authority official, which also included a senior garda, a chief fire officer, a local authority building surveyor and a local authority senior structural engineer.</P>
      <P>The codes were completed following extensive consultations with national sports organisations, stadium management, event promoters and the various statutory and non-statutory authorities involved.  The codes are voluntary and have been widely distributed to sports organisations, gardaí, health boards, local authorities, event promoters etc.</P>
      <P>Local authorities, gardaí and health boards, of course, play a central role in assisting ground management to meet their responsibilities and may, in certain circumstances, have to insist on specific measures being taken in order to achieve reasonable standards of safety.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government has recently prepared and published a further code of practice dealing specifically with Indoor Pop Concerts.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for the development of policy to facilitate and increase participation in sport and recreation.  Policy objectives in this area are pursued primarily by way of provision of grants to recognised national governing bodies of sport, and towards the cost of the development and refurbishment of sports facilities.  Sports bodies are independent, autonomous organisations which are subject to all the laws and regulations relevant to their activities, such as fire laws, building and public health regulations and, of course, criminal and civil laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to swimming, as the Deputy is aware, funding to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association was suspended last February pending <Col N="1483" /> the outcome of an independent inquiry established by the Government into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming, conducted by Dr. Roderick Murphy, S.C. Dr. Murphy's report was presented to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation in June.  The swimming association has just completed preparation of its response to the report which was submitted to me last week, and is currently being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>The code of ethics and good practice in children's sport in Ireland is also being reviewed, in close co-operation with the Department of Health and Children.  The current code, developed by a specially established expert committee under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science, was published in June 1996, and issued to all governing bodies of sport. The code is voluntary and provides detailed guidelines and assistance for sports organisations on the proper treatment of children in sport.  One of the primary objectives of the current review will be to provide guidance to sports organisations on how best to co-operate effectively with the statutory authorities, i.e. the health boards and the Garda, who have specific responsibility in relation to the protection of children and the management of child sex abuse cases.</P>

      <P>The Government, in line with the commitment given in the joint programme, An Action Plan for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, decided in November last year to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposlas.</P>
      <P>The tender procedure is being conducted in accordance with EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts. Under Article 22 of the Directive, candidates are selected for invitation to tender from among those qualified in accordance with Articles 24 to 29 thereof.  These requirements were outlined in the tender procedure notice for the project which was published in the official journal of the European communities on Wednesday 21 January 1998, and in the Irish media on the following day. The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.  No location was specified and this is a matter for individual developers.</P>
      <P>The Government has agreed to provide capital assistance, up to a maximum of £6 million, and annual operational assistance, up to a maximum of £250,000 towards the cost of implementation of the successful tender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> The deadline for submission of full tender proposals from qualified candidates is set for 27 November 1998, following which a detailed evaluation process will be undertaken.  It is expected that the successful tenderer will be identified early in the new year.</P>

      <P>My Department currently operates a scheme of provisional recognition at primary level whereby individuals who are recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in the United Kingdom or other EU member states may be appointed to a post in a primary school for a period of three years in advance of acquiring the Irish language qualification.  On attainment of the Irish language qualification, such teachers are then recognised as fully qualified primary teachers in this State.  During the period of provisional recognition these teachers are remunerated at either the qualified substitute teacher rate or at a rate which currently stands at £13,431 per annum.  On becoming fully recognised, these teachers have the teachers' common basic scale applied retrospectively in respect of any service as a temporary assistant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who are recognised as fully qualified second-level school teachers in the United Kingdom or other EU member states may be granted provisional recognition at second level in this State.  In order to qualify for full recognition, such teachers must make up any substantial shortfalls identified in their qualifications by means of either passing an aptitude test or completing an adaptation period not exceeding three years and must satisfy the Irish langauge requirement. A second level teacher who does not satisfy the Irish language requirement at the time of appointment may be appointed provisionally to a teaching position subject to his-her obtaining the appropriate qualification within a period of three years.  Pending full recognition, the teachers concerned are paid at the rate of pay equivalent to that of a probationery teacher. <Col N="1486" /></P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 401 and 437 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the case made for a resource teacher by the school to which Deputy Flanagan refers.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a major new initiative in the special education area under which all children assessed as having special educational needs will be entitled to an automatic response to those needs.  The level and nature of the response in each case will depend on the assessed needs of the child or group of children involved.  The response may take the form of a full or part-time resource teacher allocation or child care support or both, depending on the number of children involved and the nature of their needs.</P>
      <P>The school to which Deputy Flanagan refers is one of a number of schools which have applied to my Department for the services of a resource teacher.  All such applications will now be considered in the context of this new arrangement and I would expect that additional resource teacher allocations will commence in the near future and continue through 1999.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.  I allocated an additional 60 remedial teacher posts with effect from September 1998.  The number of remedial teachers in place in the primary system now stands at 1,302.  I will continue to review needs in this area and it would be my intention to continue the development of the remedial teacher service so as to ensure that all pupils with a remedial need have access to the service.</P>
      <P>Officials in my Department are currently examining all aspects of the local contribution.  When that review has been completed, I will be in a position to make any necessary decisions on the future of the local contribution.</P>

      <P>All ordinary national schools with one or more special classes received an additional grant of £1,500 plus £20 per pupil in the special class or classes.  I have also made provision for a special allocation of £250,000, on a national basis, to provide ICT hardware for individual children with special needs in mainstream classes.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that, in many cases, the grant provided by my Department has been added to significantly at local level by local groups, companies and businesses.</P>
      <P>Telecom Eireann under the &ldquo;Information Age Schools&rdquo; initiative, as a major partner in Schools, IT 2000, has provided each school, including all national schools in the above-mentioned counties, with a multimedia computer and is currently providing each of them with an Internet connection. Telecom Eireann has provided a total of 4,200 computers nationwide under this initiative. Each school is acquiring free installation of a telephone line, free rental of the line for two years, and a number of hours free usage of the line per week for Internet access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A current provision of £3 million has been made this year to provide support for Schools IT 2000 including the provision of training in the use of ICTs in education for teachers.  A programme <Col N="1488" /> of teacher professional development has already been put in place which has provided courses for at least 9,000 teachers nationally to date, a very large number of these being primary teachers, as part of the Teacher Skills Initiative.  The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) is working in collaboration with education centres to ensure appropriate provision at local level.</P>
    <P>Under the Schools Support Initiative work is nearing completion on the development of ScoilNet, an online support service, and all schools will be informed when it comes on line.  ScoilNet will also develop a countrywide network in association with the education centres.  ScoilNet will be an excellent resource as regards the provision of information, advice and support to all schools on Schools IT 2000 and also on educational ICTs issues generally.</P>
    <P>The School Integration Project (SIP), which will promote whole school development in relation to ICT integration, is an essential element of Schools IT 2000 and will involve at least 40 schools nationwide, including a significant number of primary schools, initially.  The NCTE has developed a list of priority areas and detailed criteria for the evaluation of project proposals under the SIP.  These have been circulated to all schools with an invitation to submit proposals.</P>
    <P>A number of innovative ICT pilot projects involving private sector investment in IT 2000 are in place within the education system.  These projects are concerned with software-hardware development and applications and involve a growing number of primary and second-level schools.</P>

      <P>A total of 19,997 pupils attending 125 primary schools in County Limerick have access to a remedial service.  1,431 pupils attending the remaining 21 primary schools in County Limerick do not, as yet, have access to a remedial teaching service.</P>
      <P>My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated 60 remedial teacher posts to national schools with effect from September 1998.  There are now 1,302 remedial teacher posts in place in national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will continue to review needs in this area.  In the event of additional remedial teacher posts <Col N="1489" /> becoming available for allocation, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the schools in County Limerick will be fully considered.</P>
    <P>The details of the 125 schools in County Limerick with a remedial service and the 21 primary schools without a remedial service follow.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Schools in Country Limerick which have the services of a remedial teacher.</P>

      <Col N="1493" /> 1,350 pupils attend the above schools.  My Department does not keep details on an annual basis of the numbers of children attending school who are in need of a remedial teacher.  However, the report of the special education review committee states that pupils are in need of remedial teaching if they perform at or below the tenth percentile on standardised literacy or numeracy tests.</P>
    <P>My Department received 53 applications from schools in County Mayo for the services of a remedial teacher.  All applications were considered when allocating posts last September and the successful applicants were selected on the basis of priority of need.</P>
    <P>There are 1,302 remedial teacher posts and 104 resource teacher posts at primary level.  There are 77 per cent of pupils attending national schools in County Mayo that have access to a remedial teacher service.  Of the 188 national schools in County Mayo 116 have the services of a remedial teacher and 72 schools do not, as yet, have a service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of complaints concerning management issues at Carndonagh community school.  These complaints related to the level of financial accountability to the board and the accuracy of returns of pupil enrolments submitted to my Department.</P>
      <P>Community schools are established under a deed of trust and managed by an 11 member board of management separate from my Department. The board comprises three representatives of the religious communities, three representatives of the vocational education committee, two parent and two teacher representatives.  The principal teacher of the school is a non voting member of the board of management.  My Department is not represented on the board.  Each board is responsible for the governance and direction of the school and for the procedures in place to inform board members concerning the affairs of the school.  My Department provides guidance to boards in relation to school management generally and it also supports initiatives taken by the representative management body for boards &mdash; the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools &mdash; in this regard so as to ensure that best practice obtains.  Where internal board difficulties arise, these fall to be dealt with by the board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> The complaints received concerning Carndonagh community school were referred to the board of management for its consideration and report to the Department.  The board responded stating that it was satisfied with the accountability arrangements in place at the school.</P>
    <P>In March 1995, the school informed my Department of an error in the return of enrolments submitted for 1994-5 which resulted in an overstatement of pupils attending the school.  This error was the result of inadequate checking of the return before it was submitted to my Department. The board was reminded of its obligation to ensure that such returns are accurate and complete. Roll keeping procedures have been reviewed on a number of occasions since then and my Department is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of pupil returns.</P>
    <P>My Department's internal audit unit visited the school in May 1996 to examine its operations and procedures and prepared a report on its findings. The board of management, was requested to consider the report and outline the measures being taken to address weaknesses identified in the school's systems.  Following two further visits in 1997, the internal audit unit confirmed that progress was being made in upgrading procedures at the school but further work was required in a number of areas.  Outside accounting expertise was also sanctioned for the school.</P>
    <P>My Department has also met with members of the board in 1997 and 1998 and outlined to them the board's responsibilities for the overall management of the school and the need for improved procedures.  Guidance has been given to the board in relation to good management practice generally.</P>
    <P>The complaints made did not refer to any impropriety on the part of school management and my Department's inquiries have not uncovered any evidence in this regard.  The school has co-operated fully with my Department's inquiries and the board has undertaken to accept and implement the internal audit unit's recommendations.  However, a number of issues remain to be resolved and my Department will continue to monitor progress at the school in consultation with the board of management.</P>

      <P>A range of special arrangements can apply at the certificate examinations in the case of students who suffer from dyslexia.</P>
      <P>Applications for special arrangements on behalf of such candidates are submitted to my Department by the school authorities concerned and it is open to a school to submit whatever documentation or evidence they deem appropriate in support of an application.  However the grant of a special arrangement is not contingent on a school providing any particular undertaking in relation to the matter.</P>
      <P>A range of special arrangements provided include the use of taperecorders, readers and scribes, depending on the individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this has traditionally been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.  However in the event of the examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner.  This is to ensure that notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.  For any one subject a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty or physical impairment which might cause <Col N="1497" /> difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.</P>
    <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure that problems with readability whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and in 1999 examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to staffing is that in order to implement the provisions of the PCW agreement in regard to pensions my Department has already more than doubled the permanent staff assigned to pensions and has also engaged temporary staff.</P>
      <P>Teachers who retired prior to 1 July 1994, the earliest effective date of any of the PCW provisions, and spouses who were in receipt of pension prior to 1 July 1994, have already received an increase of 2 per cent in pension, backdated to 1 May 1996.  In accordance with the terms for the payment of this amount, which was paid in January 1998, the pensioners in question are now entitled to the difference, if any, between 2 per cent and the application of the PCW provisions in their own particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Staff are currently engaged in calculating the amounts due under the PCW agreement to teachers who retired on or after 1 July 1994.</P>
      <P>With regard to the average payment due, this varies in accordance with the provisions of the PCW agreement and in accordance with length of service at retirement.  It will be different in the case of almost all teachers, since length of service is measured in days.  The average payment made (to date) to teachers who retired prior to 1 July 1994 is about £500.  The average payment made to date to teachers who retired since 1 July 1994 is about £870.</P>
      <P>To date, payments have been issued to 7,775 teachers who retired prior to 1 July 1994 and to 1,209 teachers who retired since then.</P>

      <P>I intend taking Questions Nos. 415 and 416 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has received complaints concerning the management of Carndonagh community school and in particular, the inaccurate statement of pupil numbers submitted by the school to my Department for the years 1991-2 to 1994-5 inclusive.  In response the Department took a number of steps which included an analysis of the returns submitted by the school, an analysis of the lists of pupils which were submitted in support of the complaint, interviews with the principal teacher and discussions and correspondence with the board of management.  As a result, the Department concluded that there were clear weaknesses in the school's systems during those years, particularly in the area of roll keeping and that there were no reliable records of enrolments in the school for the years 1991-2, 1992-3 and 1993-4.</P>
      <P>These weaknesses have been brought to the attention of the board and it has been reminded of its obligations to ensure that such returns to &gt;my Department are accurate and complete and assurances have been received in this regard for the future.  In addition, roll keeping procedures have been reviewed on a number of occasions since and my Department is satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of this process for 1994-5 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>My Department has received representations from the Teachers Union of Ireland concerning the complaints made concerning management at the school.  While many of the issues are within the remit of the board of management, my Department is making every effort to resolve outstanding issues and where appropriate, documentation held by my Department will be made available to relevant parties.</P>
      <P>My Department is continuing to monitor progress by the board of management in upgrading administrative and financial management at the school.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 419 and 420 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of an application from County Meath VEC for additional maintenance resources for O'Carolan college, Nobber, County Meath.</P>
      <P>School management issues including the issues of health and safety in schools, are the responsibility of local school management in the first instance and the vocational education committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of maintenance staff in the VEC sector is made on a scheme wide basis and it is a matter for each vocational education committee to deploy the staff as it sees fit.  In the case of County Meath Vocational Education Committee scheme of nine schools (2,807 pupils in 1997-8), the current approved allocation is 11 full-time caretakers and 9.5 attendant-cleaner staff whole time equivalents (17,840 hours).  This allows at least one full-time caretaker to be allocated to each of its schools and on the basis of its pupil enrolment in 1997-8 an average allocation of 6.5 attendant-cleaning hours per pupil.  I understand from the vocational education committee, that <Col N="1501" /> the current allocation to Nobber V.S comprises a full-time caretaker and 1,025 cleaning hours.</P>
    <P>In deciding the allocation of maintenance resources to vocational education committees, my Department takes into account the overall staffing resources available for allocation to the vocational education committee sector and in relation to each scheme, consideration is given to a range of factors including the existing staffing allocation and its distribution; the number and size of schools; the number of enrolments; and comparison with schemes of similar size.</P>
    <P>A decision on the County Meath application will be made shortly.</P>

      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has been preparing for the introduction of social, personal and health education (SPHE) in the context of its revision of the primary curriculum.  The revised curriculum for primary schools, including provision of SPHE, has not been introduced as yet.</P>
      <P>A programme on substance misuse prevention has been developed by my Department for primary schools.  Just over 150 schools participated in the development of this programme which was evaluated independently by an external evaluator with positive results.  I am launching the report on that evaluation this afternoon as part of European Drugs Prevention Week.  It is expected that the programme itself will be available for dissemination to primary schools generally in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> A programme of substance misuse education, On My Own Two Feet, was introduced for post primary schools, by my Department, in late 1994. Since then over 1,300 teachers from about 70 per cent of post primary schools have participated in 75 training courses on the use of the programme which has also been evaluated independently, with a positive outcome, by an external evaluator. A further 12 courses are being held this school year.</P>
    <P>The child abuse prevention programme, Stay Safe, has been introduced to primary schools over the past number of years.  The use of this programme in schools has been evaluated by my Department's inspectorate who reported favourably on the introduction of the programme.</P>
    <P>At post primary level the NCCA is just finalising a SPHE programme for junior cycle pupils.  It will be an enabling programme which will facilitate schools to incorporate key elements within their own social personal and health education programmes.  Many second level schools have developed for some time their own personal development programmes in co-operation with agencies such as regional health boards and curriculum development units-centres.</P>
    <P>The matters raised by the Deputy in relation to RSE are dealth with more fully in the replies to Questions Nos. 426 and 427.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 426 and 427 together.</P>
      <P>The Catholic managerial bodies, as education partners, have been involved at all stages in the development of the curriculum and planning for the implementation of relationships and sexuality education (RSE) in schools.  It is expected that all schools will implement a programme in accordance with the provisions of the approved curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before an RSE programme is taught in a school, a school policy on RSE is drawn up by a <Col N="1505" /> committee of six members, including two parent representatives.  Schools were circulated with guidelines to assist in the policy development process.</P>
    <P>This process encourages a co-ordinated, whole-school approach and involves consultation among school management, parents and teachers.  Issues which are of concern to any relevant party can be raised during the policy-development process.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the values inherent in the school policy will be consistent with the core values and ethos of the individual school, and that the school's programme will be developed accordingly.  The policy will be approved by the board of management and will act as a guide for school staff in drawing up the school programme.</P>

      <P>The objective in making special arrangements at the certificate examinations for students, who have either specific learning difficulties or difficulties which arise from a physical or medical condition, is to ensure as far as possible that such candidates are enabled to demonstrate at the examination their level of ability.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the interests of equity and fairness across the entire body of candidates and indeed to ensure the credibility of the examination system, the work of students must ultimately be assessed according to the same, strictly objective criteria.  This is achieved by having a common marking scheme apply to the work of all candidates in a subject and, at the same time, by ensuring that every effort is made to ensure that full credit is given in accordance with that marking scheme for the work done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular concern expressed in the information supplied by the Deputy relates to difficulties over presentation which can arise in work submitted for examination by students with specific learning difficulties.  Traditionally where such <Col N="1506" /> concerns have been expressed they have been brought to the attention of the individual examiner. This approach is intended to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
    <P>However, in the event of the examiner encountering difficulty, he or she is instructed to send the answer book to his or her supervising examiner.</P>
    <P>This year, my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure that problems with readability and presentation whether or not brought to the attention of the Department are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Every effort will continue to be made to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and, in 1999, examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>

      <P>The report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education recommended an increase in student places in what was then the Regional Technical College, Waterford, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title to regional institute of technology as a response to the higher education needs in the south-east region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the report of the steering committee was published, the number of full-time students in the <Col N="1507" /> institute has increased from the 1994-5 level of 3,500 to 4,740 in 1997-8.</P>
    <P>An increase in degree-level provision has been sanctioned by my Department in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology in the context of meeting the identified higher education needs of the south-east region.  Figures provided by the institute indicate that the number of students on degree courses has increased from an estimated 1,046 in 1994-5 to 1,825 in 1997-8, and that the intake of students to degree programmes <i>ab initio</i>, has increased from 285 to 560 in the same period.  In addition, the following new degree-level courses have been sanctioned since 1995: B.A. in Applied Social Studies; B.Sc. in Applied Biology; B.A. in Legal and Business Studies; B.A. in Applied Languages; B.Sc. in Commercial Software Development; B.A. in Financial Services; B.A. in General and Corporate Administration; B.A. in Accounting; B.Sc. in Manufacturing Systems Engineering; B.Ed. in Electronic Engineering.</P>
    <P>The institue has submitted a framework for its development to my Department and this proposal is the subject of ongoing discussions with officials.</P>
    <P>Early in 1997, the institute was designed as the Waterford Institute of Technology and arrangements have been put in place to carry through the process leading to the delegation to the institute of authority to make awards within a national qualifications framework.  The process is being carried out by an interim review group chaired by Professor Dervilla Donnelley.  I understand that the interim review group has completed a draft report on the self-evaluation study by Waterford Institue of Technology and has furnished the institute with its observations on the study and its draft recommendations.  At present, the group is considering the response from Waterford Institute of Technology to these observations and draft recommdendation prior to finalising its report which will then be submitted to me.</P>

      <P>The range of special arrangements available to students with specific learning difficulties in the 1999 certificate examinations will be the same as those granted in 1998.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that any concessions are being withdrawn for the 1999 certificate examinations as students with specific learning difficulties will continue to have their work marked in accordance with the marking schemes for the various subjects.  For any one subject, a common marking scheme is applied to the work of all candidates taking the subject, regardless of whether the candidate has a specific learning difficulty or physical impairment which might cause difficulties with the presentation and ultimate readability of material presented for examination.  To operate separate marking schemes would, in essence, amount to providing alternative examinations with separate certification for students with specific learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>The range of special arrangements granted to candidates with specific learning difficulties are for the purpose of ensuring as far as is practicable that a student with a specific learning difficulty is given every chance to demonstrate his-her ability at the examination.  These arrangements are granted on a case by case basis depending on the evidence provided in support of the application and include the use of taperecorders, readers and scribes.  Students who are dissatisfied with the arrangements proposed have access to an appeal process.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, where a concern has been expressed regarding the readability of material, this traditionally has been brought to the attention of the individual examiner.  However, in the event of an examiner encountering difficulty in reading the script, the examiner is instructed to send the answerbook to his or her supervising examiner.  This is to ensure that, notwithstanding any presentational or readability difficulties, every effort is made by the examiner or supervising examiner to ensure that the candidate is given full credit for all work done.</P>
      <P>This year my Department has moved to strengthen this arrangement by instructing all examiners who have a difficulty in accessing the information given by a candidate to refer the script to their supervising examiner.  The intention is to ensure that problems with readability, whether or not brought to the attention of the Department, are dealt with by the examiner and that no candidate is disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy that examiners will continue to make every effort to ensure that full credit is given for work presented and, in 1999, examiners will, as in previous years, be required to apply the agreed marking schemes consistently to all candidates in order to ensure equity and fairness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1511" /> From the information available to my Department the range of special arrangements applied in other jurisdictions is broadly similar to those applying here.  However there is a difficulty in making direct comparisons in relation to the approach of other examination authorities, because school-based teacher assessment is an element of overall assessment to varying degrees. By contrast, as the Deputy will be aware, our examination system involves external assessment at terminal examinations which creates the requirement, in the interests of equity and fairness to all students, of having one common marking scheme in any one subject.</P>
    <P>From time to time my Department meets with bodies representative of students with special needs and people with disabilities.  A meeting with the Association for Children with Learning Difficulties is scheduled for early December.</P>

      <Col N="1512" /> Subsequently, it was decided, in line with the practice which obtains in the third level student support schemes, to allow for progression from NCVA level 2 courses to NCVA level 3 courses. Therefore, anyone who has already completed an NCVA level 2 course and is now progressing to pursue a course at NCVA level 3, is eligible to apply for grant assistance under the European social fund aided maintenance grants scheme for post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>This decision was communicated to relevant VEC officers at a meeting between Department staff and VEC staff in September last and will be formally communicated in a letter which is due to issue shortly to all vocational education committees clarifying a number of issues which have arisen in relation to the administration of that scheme.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will abolish fees for those doing a full-time degree in nursing in view of the fact that these are the only fees payable for third level courses and amount to £2,000 per annum; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the one year full-time degree course leading to a bachelor of nursing which is offered by National University of Ireland, Galway, to students who have successfully completed the nursing registration-diploma programmes.  The position is that this course has not been recognised for the purposes of the free fees initiative.  Indeed, I would point out to the Deputy that the fees payable for this course are not the only fees payable for third level courses.  The free fees initiative applies to full-time undergraduate courses which must generally be of at least two years duration.</P>
      <P>My Department does not provide funding for the education and training of nurses.  As the Deputy will be aware, the revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training which was introduced in October 1994 is funded by the Department of Health and Children. Successful completion of the three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and students are eligible to register with An Bord Altranais for employment as a nurse.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Commission on Nursing has recommended that the future framework for the pre-registration education of nurses should be based on a four year degree programme and a forum, involving the third level institutions, the schools of nursing, health services providers and An Bord Altranais is being established by the Minister for Health and Children to agree a strategy for the implementation of degree level pre-registration nursing education and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the question of degree programmes, there are a number of part-time programmes <Col N="1513" /> which are provided on a self-financing basis.  The course at University College Galway is the only full-time degree course and I understand that the Minister for Health and Children is not in a position to provide funding for these courses which lead to optional post-registration qualification. As legal proceedings have been instituted in relation to the non-payment of fees for the course in question.  I do not consider it appropriate for me to comment further on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is anticipated that the size of the 1998-9 dividend will be known more accurately early in 1999.  At that stage, consideration will be given to the manner in which the dividen will be utilised.</P>

      <P>There are currently 224 posts in primary schools under this scheme.  There is no provision for any additional posts in 1999 as this scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant. However, in order to maintain the existing number of clerk-typist posts in primary schools, I have provided for an increased allocation of £4,049,000 in the 1999 Estimates, as opposed to the 1998 figure of £3,300,000.</P>
      <P>The provision of clerical services in primary schools, which are not included in the 1978 scheme, is now being funded under a phased scheme of additional capitation grants to schools introduced under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP) in 1992.</P>

      <P>In the expenditure Estimates for the public services published last week, I was pleased to announce a major increase in education spending for next year which will be targeted at the areas most in need of additional resources including the funding of voluntary secondary schools. The programme of increased expenditure includes a £7 increase in the standard <i>per capita</i><Col N="1516" /> grant payable to voluntary secondary schools. This compares with a freeze introduced by the last Government.</P>
      <P>The way in which resources are provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, community and comprehensive schools and voluntary secondary schools.  Consequently, direct comparison between the different sectors is difficult.</P>
      <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis based upon enrolments while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school.</P>
      <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools.</P>
