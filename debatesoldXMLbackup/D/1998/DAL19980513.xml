      <P>The Government has promised legislation to reform the criminal law.  Will any of this be of assistance to the Garda in dealing with the apparent resurgence of murders of elderly people in the west?  We have had a brutal murder in Charlestown and another in Athlone.  The Government will recollect that operation Shannon was particularly successful in the past in dealing with this.  Are there any plans to initiate a similar operation to protect the elderly?</P>

The Garda are investigating the two recent cases and I hope under existing legislation they will be <Col N="3" /> able to apprehend those involved in these murders.  I do not think there is a need for any particular measures.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is the second Finance Bill which I am introducing to the House as Minister for Finance. While I did not expect to be before the House again so soon with taxation legislation, I think everyone will agree that the recent Government action in response to developments in the housing sector was required.  Consequently, the measures contained in this Bill are necessary to ensure that a balance is restored to this market and that more importantly, the sharp increase in house prices can be addressed and defused.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the specific provisions of the Bill &mdash; the legislative consequences of the Government's action &mdash; I wish to briefly reiterate the rationale behind the Government's response to the recent trend in house prices.  This response has not been <i>ad hoc.</i>  It is a well thought out and integrated package of measures, from which we cannot afford to pick and choose.  Each of the elements has a part to play in achieving the balance we are seeking.</P>
      <P>The rapid escalation in house prices over the past few years has had serious adverse implications for first time buyers.  Furthermore, excessive house price increases carry potentially serious implications for the wider economy in terms of possible inflationary effects and the dangers of excessive personal borrowing.  It was necessary, therefore, for the Government to take action in this area and a comprehensive range of measures in relation to the housing market was announced on 23 April 1998 on foot of the economic assessment of the recent house prices developments.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that late last year, the Government commissioned a comprehensive study of housing.  The report on the developments in house prices by Peter Bacon and Associates has provided us with an independent, expert analysis of the situation, which has become a matter of serious public concern.  Furthermore, this report provides a sound platform on which to formulate a balanced, well targeted package of measures to address this critical issue.</P>
      <P>There are two priorities the Government must address regarding housing.  First, the question of affordability of housing, especially for lower income groups needed to be addressed.  I have said previously that this Government is not prepared to countenance the possible development of a situation where the goal of home ownership might be pushed beyond the reach of a significant proportion of households who reasonably aspire to it.  Second, the long-term strength, stability and balance of the housing sector must not be jeopardised by excessive overheating or distortions in the market of which recent price developments are symptomatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants' report has given clear recognition to these priorities and the Government's package will help restore balance to the housing market.  This package will also help to remove <Col N="8" /> another significant factor that has been fuelling price escalation &mdash; the expectation or, depending on one's perspective, fear of further major price increases.  The publication of the report itself, with the Government's speedy response, will help take much of the heat out of the market.  Furthermore, it is hoped that this package will restore a degree of parity between the various market participants, the owner-occupier and the investor.</P>
    <P>The Government has formulated a selected range of actions designed to alleviate these pressures, on both the demand and supply side, which are identified in the report as causing overheating, bottlenecks or distortions in the housing market.  The Government's response consists broadly of a three-pronged approach.  First, measures to increase the potential supply of housing which involves increasing the availability of serviced land by the removal of infrastructural constraints, promoting increased densities at appropriate locations, encouraging faster release of serviced land for residential development and achieving better movement within the existing housing stock.  Second, measures to dampen excessive investor demand and thereby help restore better balance between supply and demand and third, measures to improve the position of prospective first time buyers.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific taxation measures contained in the Bill.  It is usual on Second Stage to give a run through of the main sections contained in the Bill.  Given that the Bill is short and deals specifically with the issue of housing, I propose to outline briefly each section even though the explanatory memorandum gives a more detailed description of individual sections.</P>
    <P>Section 1 gives effect to the changes in the treatment of interest on borrowings used to purchase, improve or repair rented residential property.  The consultants recommended the removal of the deductibility of interest on borrowings for residential property against rental income for tax purposes.  The Government has accepted this recommendation.  Accordingly, investors will no longer be entitled to a deduction for tax purposes against rental income in respect of interest on borrowings used on or after 23 April 1998 to purchase, improve or repair residential property. This measure, which will apply to individuals, partnerships and companies, will directly address the situation identified in the report that investors were, to some extent, replacing first time buyers in the market &mdash; a development which goes against the thrust of housing policy objectives accepted in recent decades.  As is only reasonable, however, pipeline cases have been catered for, where a contract in writing was in place before 23 April 1998 to purchase an investment residential property and the borrowed money is employed for that purpose by 31 December 1998, instead of 30 September 1998 as announced in the Government statement of 23 April.</P>
    <P>Neither will the restriction apply to borrowed money employed on the improvement or repair of a residential premises which on 23 April 1998 <Col N="9" /> or at any time in the 12 months to that date was a rented residential premises and which was owned by the investor on 23 April 1998 or which was purchased by him or her on or before 31 December 1998 under a contract in writing entered into before 23 April 1998.</P>
    <P>The disallowance of interest will not apply to rented residential properties covered by the provisions of the designated seaside resorts scheme or the new rural renewal scheme.  Neither will it apply to holiday cottages or holiday apartments in other parts of the country, registered or listed with Bord Fáilte, where the planning permission specifically states that the premises are not to be rented or leased for periods in excess of two consecutive calender months at any one time.  This latter exclusion will, however, only apply to developments where planning applications were received by the planning authority prior to 23 April 1998.</P>
    <P>The section also clarifies that Irish investors who invest in residential property outside the State will also be subject to the new restrictions on interest deductibility.  Thus such investment outside and within the State will be treated in the same way.  In the case of rented residential property outside the State the restriction will not, however, apply where a contract in writing was in place before 7 May 1998, the date of publication of the Bill, to purchase the property and the borrowed money is employed for that purpose by 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>Section 1 also provides that where, at any time on or after 23 April 1998, a person turns their sole or main residence into rented accommodation, the restriction on relief for interest will apply from the date of the change of use, irrespective of when the borrowed money was employed.  This measure is included to prevent people buying a house moving into that house and retaining their original house for letting purposes.  To have allowed that situation would have run counter to the thrust of these measures, that is, to restore some balance in the housing market between investor and owner-occupier.  These arrangements are fair and reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is an anti-avoidance measure designed to prevent the circumvention of the measures in section 1 by channelling the borrowed moneys through a company or partnership. If this situation had not been catered for, a person could have obtained tax relief on interest on the borrowed money invested in the company or partnership which he or she could then invest in rented residential property.</P>
    <P>Section 3 implements the Government decision to introduce a temporary reduction in the rate of capital gains tax on development land from 40 per cent to 20 per cent for disposals of serviced land zoned for residential use which are made between 23 April 1998 and 5 April 2002.  The consultants recommended that, to encourage the supply of serviced land zoned residential, such a measure was required.  The consultants were not specific in <Col N="10" /> their definition of what should constitute serviced land and, consequently, I have decided to link the 20 per cent rate to the planning process.  This is a transparent way of implementing the Government decision.</P>
    <P>To qualify for this temporary reduction in the CGT rate on a disposal of development land, planning permission for residential development on the land must have been acquired prior to the disposal and such permission must still be in force at the time of disposal.  Furthermore, if the contract for sale of the land which has planning permission for residential development is conditional on planning permission other than for residential development being obtained, this temporary reduction in the rate of CGT will not apply.</P>
    <P>This section also provides for a new 60 per cent rate of CGT to apply from 6 April 2002 to disposals made from that date of development land zoned residential.  This is in accordance with the recommendations contained in the consultants' report and will act as a further incentive to the early release of land suitable for residential development, thereby increasing supply.</P>
    <P>Part 2 of the Bill contains the stamp duty provisions of the Government package.  The House has had an opportunity to discuss these measures as they were contained in the Financial Resolution passed by the Dáil on 28 April 1998 subject to one change in the case of pipeline cases.  I will outline briefly the changes in the stamp duty code.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a definitions section.  Section 5 provides that the reduced rates of stamp duty on residential property and the imposition of stamp duty on all new residential property bought by non-owner occupiers will apply to all conveyances which take place on or after 23 April 1998.  Pipeline cases have been catered for where written contracts had been entered into prior to 23 April 1998 and the conveyance takes place by 31 December 1998.  This is an extension of three months on the 30 September 1998 period specified in the Financial Resolution.  Where these transitional arrangements apply, the existing stamp duty relief on new residential property will continue to apply to investors.</P>
    <P>Section 6 and the Schedule impose the new rates of stamp duty for residential property. These new rates are as follows: residential property valued at up to and including £60,000 is exempt; in excess of £60,000 but not exceeding £100,000, 3 per cent; in excess of £100,000 but not exceeding £170,000, 4 per cent; in excess of £170,000 but not exceeding £250,000, 5 per cent; in excess of £250,000 but not exceeding £500,000, 7 per cent; and in excess of £500,000, 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the transfer of mixed property, that is, property which has a residential and a non-residential element.  In such cases, the Bill provides for the imposition of stamp duty as if it were two separate properties.  In other words, the residential element will be chargeable to stamp duty at the new residential rates and the non-residential element of the transaction will be chargeable <Col N="11" /> to stamp duty at the appropriate non-residential stamp duty rates.  In this situation there will be no aggregation between the two rates. Sections 8 and 9 provide for the apportionment of the consideration on a just and reasonable basis in the case of mixed properties.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the existing stamp duty exemption for new housing not exceeding 125 square metres is restricted to owner-occupiers.  In other words, if the purchaser does not intend to reside in the property and that property is not his or her only or main place of residence, stamp duty will apply at the appropriate residential rate.</P>
    <P>Sections 11 and 13 deal with larger new housing units.  If the purchaser is an owner-occupier, the existing treatment of levying duty on either the site cost or on 25 per cent of the aggregate cost of the site plus the building cost, whichever is the greater, will continue.  If the purchaser is not an owner-occupier, stamp duty at the appropriate rate on the full amount of the transaction will be charged.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is a technical matter dealing with mixed property and specifies that all details of how the consideration is to be apportioned must be supplied to Revenue.  Sections 14 and 15, contained in Part 3, deal with the &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; provisions and relate to the Short Title, respectively.</P>
    <P>The Government has acted in a decisive and considered manner.  While criticisms have been made, inside and outside the House, about certain aspects of its response, the measures contained in the Bill are an appropriate response by Government and must be viewed with the other measures being taken as an overall package.  The suggestion that building activity will cease because of these measure is unfounded.  I have taken heart from recent media reports of sales of properties to owner-occupiers where in previous schemes a significant percentage of sales were made to investors.  This is evidence that there is sufficient demand for housing from those who wish to purchase as an owner-occupier.  To suggest otherwise is to miss the point of the detailed analysis contained in the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>I look forward to an interesting and good debate on this important measure which I am pleased to commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for acting expeditiously in introducing this Bill so soon after he announced his intention two weeks ago but that is where my welcome begins and ends.  There is a housing crisis.  Prices have risen to a level and at a rate which were not credible even 12 months ago.  This is extremely disturbing.  It has brought about a situation where persons who would normally expect to own their own houses can no longer afford to do so.  Certain professions such as nurses, teachers, gardaí, middle grade civil servants and those on the average industrial wage can no longer afford to buy their own houses.  The <Col N="12" /> Government must face up to this situation and move to rectify it.</P>
      <P>The Minister was short on details of the policy underpinning the measures.  I presume he intends to continue the position in Ireland where it is the norm for people to own their homes and he is in favour of owner-occupiers.  His measures regarding rented accommodation appear to indicate that he does not consider the solution to the housing problem will be provided by the rental sector.  He has pinned his colours to the mast in terms of a solution which involves people being able to afford to buy their own homes.</P>
      <P>Why has the crisis occurred?  Essentially, it is a supply and demand problem.  There is a lack of supply for the demand which currently exists in the marketplace.  The Bacon report examined the situation carefully and its analysis of the problem is good, although I do not fully support its solutions.  I agree the effects of the baby boom in the late 1960s and early 1970s are now becoming apparent.  It is one of the few occasions when the entire crop of people leaving second and third level education can expect to be employed in Ireland.  The pressure valve which was always available through emigration is no longer necessary.  The full young population is in the marketplace and they want to buy their own homes.  This is where the demand arises.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report includes an interesting statistic.  It suggests the net emigration figure of 15,000 last year was composed of approximately 30,000 people leaving Ireland and approximately 45,000 to 46,000 people returning.  The point which weighed heavily on me was that those who are leaving the country are between the ages of 16 and 24 while those returning are between the ages of 24 and 35.  The people leaving are not at a house buying age while those returning are at that age.  The additional net demand is not the 15,000 net figure of emigration but the 45,000 people returning.  This is in addition to the demand which already exists and that is driving the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similar to the demand for Mercedes cars, demand is nothing unless it is supported by money.  The fact that many people want to own their own homes or bigger properties is not demand in the economic sense.  Demand must be supported by hard cash so what has caused the position where there appears to be enough money available to people, particularly in Dublin, to drive prices to astronomical heights?  The Minister must, to an extent, bear responsibility for this position.  He inherited an economic boom from the rainbow Government which has given extra income to sections of society.  In addition the Minister introduced an expansionary budget against the prospect of a fall in interest rates. Already the prospect of interest rates falling by 2 per cent has been discounted in the property market but people are making their borrowing arrangements in the expectation of reduced interest rates.  This is feeding the problem to a major extent. <Col N="13" /> Even after reading the Bacon report and listening to the Minister, it is difficult to pinpoint the key to rising house prices and to explain how a house which cost £100,000 in Dublin 15 months ago now costs more than £200,000.  It is difficult to understand what is driving the market.  The Minister in bringing forward a package of solutions may get it right in certain respects but wildly wrong in others.  It is always dangerous to interfere with the market and there is a serious danger that the Minister's proposals, particularly in respect of rented accommodation, will not work out as planned.  A bad situation could be made worse.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts about the Minister's changes in the way interest relief on rented accommodated will be treated for taxation purposes.  Up to now a person borrowing to buy a property for rental purposes could write off the cost of the interest against the borrowing.  This provided a good rental market which is necessary. There is no point pretending everybody will own their home or that many young people at some time will not be in rented accommodation.  I fear the Minister's proposals will cause a serious problem very quickly and rented accommodation will no longer be available in the market.</P>
    <P>Rented accommodation is, by and large, provided by persons who have an occupation.  The provision of rented accommodation is not their primary profession.  A small number of people specialise in buying and converting property into bedsits, flats and apartments, but that is not the general position.  Frequently, people who reach the point where their families are reared and their mortgage is paid buy a second house and rent it out to young people.  There is no great market in private rented accommodation for married couples with children.  This area has never been developed.  It is a single person's market.  The Minister is introducing a severe measure which will discourage people from investing in second houses for rental purposes.  In terms of the arithmetic of the proposal, people who traditionally would have bought a second house in a housing estate to rent to nurses in the local hospital will no longer do so because it will not make economic sense.  By turning off the tap completely, the Minister will cause a serious problem.</P>
    <P>There are 100,000 people in the greater urban area of my city of Limerick and approximately 10,000 are in university or third level colleges. Students make up 10 per cent of the total population and they will not become owner occupiers. They need rented accommodation.  In addition, young people in the information technology industry require accommodation.  It was announced recently that 3,000 people will be employed by Dell in Limerick.  Some of these are residents of the city already and will live at home with their families, but many people will move to Limerick.  There is a major demand for rented accommodation, including from people returning to Ireland after periods abroad.</P>
    <P>We hear much about bright young third level <Col N="14" /> graduates with experience abroad returning to Dublin to work in the financial services industry and the new high tech industries.  They are in the market for rented accommodation in the first instance.  The Minister's measures will cause a serious problem in the rental market.  Ultimately, we face a housing and accommodation problem which cannot be segmented.  It cannot be said that there is only a problem for owner occupiers and there is no difficulty with accommodation for people who rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals will put pressure on the rented market.  This pressure will be caused immediately and will become acute when students returning to college seek accommodation in September and also in the run up to Christmas.  The ordinary investor will switch off from buying rental accommodation.</P>
    <P>In the western part of Dublin, the Leixlip and Maynooth areas and out towards the Minister's constituency, there is a major demand for rented accommodation due to the location of the university in Maynooth and many industries, including Intel in Leixlip.  This demand is supplied by ordinary women and men who have paid off their mortgages or are in a position to raise a second mortgage for a rental property.  It does not involve big investors or major capitalism.  It is the smaller end of the market and it will no longer make economic sense if the interest cannot be written off.  It is a serious mistake on the Minister's part.  I understand he is trying to dampen down one specific sector.  However, he has gone too far and I intend to move an amendment on Committee Stage to allow interest at the standard rate.  A case can be made that owner occupiers can only get interest on a mortgage at the standard rate.  Consequently it would be unfair on a person renting accommodation to be able to get interest relief at the marginal rate.  A better proposal to dampen down the market as the Minister intends would be to apply the interest at the standard rate rather than the marginal rate.  This would not cause the rental crisis I expect and the Minister should consider it.</P>
    <P>There are many fine old houses in areas such as Ranelagh, Rathmines and Rathgar that are converted to bedsits.  When these houses are sold there is a tendency to restore them to single owner-occupier residences.  That tendency will now be magnified and when such properties come on the market it is likely that they will be bought for a single owner-occupier rather than for rental purposes.  In Leinster Road, for example, where there may be nine or ten apartments in a house, a great deal of rental accommodation will be lost with every house that is bought by a single owner-occupier.  I will move another amendment which proposes that the purchaser of a house for letting purposes will be allowed interest if it is already converted to apartments or flats.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second taxation measure proposes that the rate of capital gains tax in certain disposals of development land will be reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  Much of the difficulty <Col N="15" /> in the housing market since Christmas is due to the Minister's reduction of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent which applied to house property as well as all other disposable assets.  Many people rushed into the housing market then for capital gains purposes rather than acquiring an investment income.  People thought that if they bought in January on a rising price trajectory and sold in March they would make a killing that would be taxed at 20 per cent rather than 40 per cent.  That was a serious mistake and we have stated why on other occasions.  All Members are in favour of lower tax rates, but lowering any tax rate from 40 per cent to 20 per cent will distort the market.  One of the key factors in driving the property market crazy in the first quarter of 1998 was that measure.</P>
    <P>All finance spokespersons are aware that developers lobbied strongly to remove the only exception the Minister included in the Finance Bill and to extend this provision to development land.  The Minister has effectively conceded this. He is giving in to a lobby and using the cover of the housing crisis to allow development land to be included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>If one took the report as being totally independent, there is a carrot in the reduction of capital gains tax and a stick in the threat of taxation at 60 per cent if development land is not disposed of in four years.  If the report is taken on its merits, its method of introduction is the height of foolishness because there have obviously been second thoughts about this measure in the Department of Finance at official, if not political level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now tying this to the planning process.  Rather than making extra land available, this measure will restrict its availability.  Traditionally, there was a landowner, usually a farmer, a developer and a builder.  The developer and builder were sometimes the same person. The Minister is now proposing a 20 per cent rate of capital gains tax on disposal of land provided that land has planning permission.  When he announced this measure originally I thought he was referring to zoned land or other land which had the potential to be built on.  If one did not have an ideological problem with someone making a killing that would be taxed at 20 per cent, it might bring extra land on to the market and relieve the supply of land for houses.  However, <Col N="16" /> by tying it to the planning process the Minister has handcuffed the system.  Traditionally the landowner did not look for planning permission before disposing of land.  The land went on the market and the developer or developer-builder bought it and sought planning permission.  Now people who do not have the first idea about development will be forced through the planning process before availing of 20 per cent capital gains tax relief.</P>
    <P>Tying this to the planning process makes this a very restrictive measure.  No local authority will consider a planning application for development land unless it has been zoned first.  The Bacon report states that not enough land has been zoned, but the Minister is being restrictive. Rather than extending zoning to increase the supply of building land, his capital gains tax proposal means that not only will the land have to be zoned for housing, but there will have to be planning permission for it before the 20 per cent rate applies at disposal.  The landowner, developer and builder all want to maximise their profits and the Minister has brought about a situation whereby landowners will be advised by their solicitors and accountants to apply for planning permission before disposing of lands.  The situation has been made dramatically worse.  By definition, no planning authority will grant planning permission unless land has been zoned for housing first.  An application will not be considered unless the area is zoned for housing.  There is a zoning restriction on supply and the Minister is superimposing a further restriction with the necessity for planning permission.  There seems to be agreement that there is a supply and demand problem and that that is due to the lack of suitable land for housing.  The Minister has brought in a tax incentive intended to free up the market but it will do the reverse.  Rather than bringing land on to the market quickly it will hold the process up.</P>
    <P>Many Members have served on local authorities.  It might be possible to get a planning permission in eight weeks for one house, but someone looking for permission for 100 or 200 houses will encounter toing and froing between the proposer and the planning office.  It starts with the developer's architect bringing plans to the planning office, and eight weeks later the planning office sends a letter requesting information to the developer.  A list of questions is sent to the developer eight weeks after that.  Does the Minister believe that a local farmer will get involved in this kind of detail before his land can be put on the market?  It is a daft proposal, though I can see the Minister's problem.  He will be subject to political criticism for not only encouraging further windfall profits but for providing that the taxpayer gets little return from those profits.  When the rate was 40 per cent the taxpayer got something from windfall profits which accrue principally to developers as a result of taxpayers' money being spent on services.  The Minister had a political problem justifying this when bringing the capital gains tax to 20 per cent, but by tying it to the <Col N="17" /> planning process he will cause problems.  The Bacon report suggested loosening the market, providing more land for building and doing so quickly.  The Minister is ensuring the process will be slowed down.</P>
    <P>Much of the land now zoned will not come on the market unless it is already in the hands of developers and builders.  Land where there is planning permission for housing estates is in the hands of developers or builders and is being dealt with through the system.  With the present push in the market that land is not being held back. The difficulty arises in respect of zoned land, which people are holding on to and which has not been used for building, and land outside zoned areas in respect of which there is an expectation of zoning.  The Minister should think again about tying this into the planning process because by doing so he would further distort the market rather than free it up.</P>
    <P>I commented at length previously on the provisions on stamp duty.  In the third paragraph of the Minister's speech he said the rapid escalation of house prices over the past few years has had serious adverse implications for first time buyers. My main objection to the provisions of the Bill is they do not target first time buyers.  They do not do anything unique for them.  All the measures are universal provisions.  The person who is trading up and buying a second property will have a much bigger reduction in real terms from the new schedule of stamp duty than the first time buyer.</P>
    <P>I revert to the proposal I put forward when the Finance Bill passed through the House earlier this year.  The stamp duty provisions should target first time buyers.  I will introduce an amendment which will propose first time buyers of second-hand houses should be exempt from stamp duty up to and including the first £100,000 of the purchase price.  Those who buy a house for £100,000 or less should be exempt from stamp duty and those who buy a house for more than that price should have the nominal stamp duty on £100,000 offset against their stamp duty bill.  That is a better proposal, favours first time buyers of second-hand houses and will do something for young couples entering the market for the first time.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the rescheduling of stamp duty which does anything for first time buyers above and beyond what it does for everyone else. The Minister will probably point out there is an exemption from stamp duty up to £60,000, but where can one buy a house for £60,000 or less in Dublin or other urban areas?  Lest people in their innocence believe stamp duty would apply to the balance of the purchase price over £60,000, the position is once the value of the property exceeds £60,000 the 3 per cent stamp duty rate will apply to the total value of the property, not only to the balance of the purchase price over £60,000.</P>
    <P>A serious problem with the Minister's proposal is that nothing specific is being done for first time buyers.  I do not believe the set of proposals he has brought forward will meet the obvious need that exists.  My party will oppose the Bill on <Col N="18" /> Second Stage and on tomorrow's Committee Stage I will propose amendments along the lines of the proposals I have made in the course of my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second Finance Bill to come before the House this year.  This is the second opportunity the House has to make changes in tax law aimed at dealing with what has become a serious housing crisis.  We should not have needed two bites of the cherry.  The measures we take this week should have been taken three or six months ago.  Some of the measures in the Bill before us were advocated by me and other Opposition spokespersons many months ago.  I refer in particular to the reduction in stamp duty on second-hand houses and the application of stamp duty to purchases of new houses by people other than owner-occupiers. These measures should have been taken months ago and not now.</P>
      <P>In the six months since the Bacon report was commissioned housing prices in this city have increased by nearly 20 per cent.  Many young people in Dublin, Galway and Cork who could have afforded to buy a house last autumn cannot do so now.  Those people have the Minister and his colleagues to thank for the predicament in which they now find themselves.</P>
      <P>Dr. Bacon produced an interesting and useful report, but I wonder whether it was necessary or advisable to suspend all action until such time as this report was available.  Perhaps the Minister could let us know how much this report cost.  I suspect it cost a great deal and that we could employ quite a few senior civil servants full-time for the amount it cost us to pay Dr. Bacon and his associates.  I do not intend to be frivolous and I certainly do not intend that as a direct criticism of Dr. Bacon and his work, but this is a serious issue.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable to use outside consultancy if the expertise needed is not readily available in the Civil Service.  It is advisable to use outside consultancy when seeking to evaluate work done in the Civil Service, but it is neither necessary nor desirable to farm out work, however important, which could be done perfectly adequately in the Civil Service and in respect of which there is an urgency.  It does not make any sense if the consultant in question spends much of his or her time consulting the civil servants who would have made the recommendations in the first place.  In those circumstances it is reasonable to ask what additional expertise has been brought to bear which would not otherwise have been available in the Civil Service.  If there is no tick-tacking between the civil servants and the Minister who commissioned the report, one runs the risk of coming up with recommendations that are unpalatable or unacceptable.  That is precisely what happened to the Government in case of the Atkins report.  His recommendations have been entirely supplanted by the work done by a single policy adviser to the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> Dr. Bacon has done a great deal of good work and good analysis.  I find the analysis interesting and useful and I agree with quite a few of his recommendations but by no means all of them.  I sometimes find it difficult to make the connection between the analysis and the recommendations. Suffice to say Dr. Bacon has done a good day's work and he deserves our thanks. *sam The scale of the housing crisis is difficult to overstate.  It is particularly acute in Dublin and Galway, but it is also serious in many of our major cities and towns.  The crisis in Dublin is having serious spillover effects as far away as Portlaoise and Drogheda.  Demand for housing is rising at an unprecedented rate.  It is being driven at least in part by demographic changes.  There are a larger number of smaller household units requiring a greater number of dwelling units.  In addition, as Deputy Noonan said, large numbers of people in the house buying age bracket are returning from abroad and are looking to buy houses for the first time.  Demand is also being pushed by people who want to invest in property.</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge the supply of new houses has been increasing quite considerably for some years.  The total number of units of apartments and houses completed last year was almost double that of five years ago, but it has not met the demand and there is a need to increase the supply further.  However, we will never be able to satisfy the demand for houses and apartments as long as that demand continues to be made up in ever greater measure by people who want to buy property as an investment.  I have no problem, in principle, with people who want to build up a nest egg for their retirement or with people who want to make a profit from trading in property, but I have a problem with investment in property if it is having the effect, as it is, of driving first time buyers out of the market.</P>
    <P>Single people who want to buy an average new house in Dublin would need to be earning £30,000 before they could reasonably afford to do so.  That is assuming they are willing to borrow more than three times their annual income and commit themselves to a high level of repayments for much of their working lives.  The truth is most people cannot afford to do this even if they wanted to.  The result is people are obliged to live with their parents, in rented accommodation or to move to areas of the city or beyond it where they would not otherwise choose to live.  Do we want to help these people and are we willing to intervene in the market to give that help?  The answer to that question should be a resounding yes.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed today and by Bacon should be judged according to one criterion &mdash; the extent to which they help the first time buyer. It would be nice to be able to help those who want to trade up and those who want to invest for long-term gain, but ultimately our priority is clear.  It must be to help those who have not yet got their feet on the bottom rung of the ladder, <Col N="20" /> to help those who are otherwise being priced out of the housing market.</P>
    <P>I want to consider in detail some of the proposals in the Bill.  The Bill gives effect to the changes in stamp duty set out in the resolution discussed in this House on 28 April last.  I indicated my attitude to those changes in that debate and I do not intend to labour the point today. The rates and thresholds for stamp duty purposes were set out many years ago.  They should have been index linked but were not.  The thresholds for CAT purposes are index linked, as were those for RPT purposes.  The fact that the thresholds for stamp duty purposes were not linked in this way has meant that virtually all transactions have, until recently, been chargeable at a rate originally intended for larger or luxury houses only.  This was unintended and inequitable and it is right it should be changed.  For that reason I supported it when we discussed the financial resolution.</P>
    <P>I have two criticisms of the stamp duty changes.  First, they will ultimately be of primary benefit to the vendor, not the purchaser.  I know the Minister shares this view because he expressed it when he replied to the Second Stage debate on the financial resolution.  In effect, we are giving all purchasers, without discrimination, an additional few thousand pounds to play with.  This will inevitably result in bidding up the price of houses by a few thousand pounds.  This is exactly what happened to the first time buyer's grant.  The reality is that most bidders increase the price of houses by a few thousand pounds more than they might otherwise have been increased.  Many builders have put schemes in place whereby they can effectively arrange for the direct payment of the new house grant to them.  It is likely that something similar will happen as a result of a reduction in stamp duty rates.  I have heard nothing from the Minister or Dr. Bacon to persuade me otherwise.</P>
    <P>My second criticism relates to the Minister's failure to target stamp duty relief at first time buyers, who are surely the people we wish to help.  It is of no help to first time buyers if those against whom they are competing for a property have been similarly helped by the Minister's measures.  Targeted help is needed, not the scattergun approach we got.</P>
    <P>The Minister will claim that the reduction in stamp duty and the consequent reduction in transaction costs is intended to bring more houses, specifically second-hand ones, into the market.  It is likely that this will lead to a greater number of transactions.  However, in the final analysis this does not solve the basic problem of too many buyers trying to buy too few houses. This problem can only be solved by increasing the supply of houses and taking some buyers out of the market.  The reduction in stamp duty will do neither.</P>
    <P>I wish to look at some of the measures proposed by Dr. Bacon intended to increase the supply of houses.  His survey of building land in the major cities is quite impressive and persuasive. He sets out in detail the needs of the greater <Col N="21" /> Dublin region.  He details specific infrastructural projects such as sewerage schemes, which he believes need to be carried through if we are to improve the supply of serviced building land.  He identifies potential sources of building land and suggests some reasons the supply of land is so inelastic, despite considerable price changes.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bacon suggests that some of these projects can be accomplished by means of public-private partnerships.  From my experience on the Finance and General Affairs Committee in the last Dáil, I know that Dr. Bacon has done some work on PFIs or PPPs.  IBEC has been looking at these issues in recent months, as a matter of some urgency.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I endorse in principle the concept of public-private partnerships and the issue is worthy of a debate in itself.</P>
    <P>The notion that the State could, should and must always fund to the last penny all major infrastructural projects and manage them indefinitely is clearly no longer tenable or desirable. That does not mean the traditional model is wrong or that it may not be appropriate in some cases in the future.  However, alternative models must also be looked at.  There are instances where it will be appropriate for a particular project to be farmed out to the private sector.  There are projects which can and should be jointly financed between the private and public sectors.  Likewise, future management of projects, such as a sewerage scheme or an electricity generator, could be done entirely by the public sector, entirely by the private sector or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>PPPs or PFIs are not a panacea and there are times when they may be inappropriate or wrong. The private sector will always demand a return on its money and there are times when it would it be inappropriate to grant this when the level demanded is excessive.  These are issues of principle and practice which will have to be teased out in years to come.  In my view, and in that of my party, the use of PPPs to facilitate development needed to sustain housing is appropriate, provided it is properly set up and managed.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bacon and his associates identified the lack of infrastructural development as the primary reason serviced lands or lands zoned for housing have been slow to come on the market. I agree with this cogent argument.  However, he then goes on, in a fashion which I do not understand, to make a conclusion with which I do not agree.  He believes that the short-term supply of land can be increased by offering a rebate of CGT to be financed by a clawback of CGT in a few years.</P>
    <P>The Government, in part for administrative reasons, alters the Bacon recommendations by providing for a 50 per cent reduction in CGT now and an increase in CGT on development land to 60 per cent in four years.  This conclusion is bizarre.  We know from Dr. Bacon's analysis that the profits made by landowners dealing in development land have increased enormously in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Landowners and those trading in building land have been the great beneficiaries of the increase in house prices.  Their profit margins have shot up to levels which are downright immoral.  I say this because of the nature of the profit involved.  The profit comes about, not because of any major investment made by the landowner but because the land was rezoned by the local authority and it has granted or may grant planning permission for the development of houses.  There is no requirement on the landowner to make any investment or to do any work.  He or she is making a fortuitous windfall gain brought about largely by the actions of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Our tax code has long taken the view that the windfall gain accruing to landowners or the speculative gain accruing to people who deal in development land should be taxed at a rate in excess of that which is normally chargeable.  For many years, CGT on development land was at a very high rate.  I assume the Minister was persuaded by this argument as he left the rate of CGT on development land at 40 per cent when he reduced the rate on everything else to 20 per cent in his budget last December.  Landowners and speculators of development land are already making an enormous profit.  We will not increase the supply of available land if we further add to what is already a supernormal profit.</P>
    <P>It can be argued &mdash; and the Minister probably will &mdash; that this is a carrot and stick approach and the 20 per cent rate must be matched against the 60 per cent rate in four years' time.  Perhaps this approach would work if both parts of the proposal were equally credible.  The problem is that the proposal to increase the CGT rate to 60 per cent in four years' time is incredible.  Is the Minister seriously telling us he will increase the rate of CGT on development land to 60 per cent in three to four years' time?  Will he really be able to tell this House the housing crisis is over, the supply of housing land is adequate and he will therefore treble the rate of CGT from 20 per cent to 60 per cent?  Any Minister in any Government at any time would find this difficult to do.  Coming from this Minister, the proposition is beyond belief and absurd.</P>
    <P>It is not difficult to imagine the arguments which will be made in three years' time.  We will be told that the supply of building land will completely dry up if we treble the rate of CGT.  We will be told that landowners will hold on to their land until the penal rate of tax is reduced in the future.  We will be told that landowners will increase the price of land to make up for the loss of profit and that this in turn will increase the price of houses.  I do not believe it will be possible for this or any Government to increase CGT threefold in four years' time.  If the stick is not credible and the carrot is not necessary, the whole operation should be ditched now.</P>
    <P>The most controversial aspect of this Bill relates to the treatment of property for investment purposes.  I wish to compliment the Minister.  When we discussed the financial resolution <Col N="23" /> dealing with stamp duty, I expressed some doubt that he would follow through on his expressed determination to make provisions in this Bill for the deductibility of interest.  I expected a furore from people with a vested interest.  I was not disappointed in that regard and I am sure the Minister's phone has been hopping in the meantime. However, the Minister has done well.  Unless something unusual happens in the next 24 hours, it seems that the commitments given will be followed through.  The Minister added to this by reducing capital gains tax by 50 per cent last December.  That reduction can only have been intended to encourage people to invest in property and certainly it has had that effect.</P>
    <P>Is it not strange the Minister is now taking a number of actions clearly intended to drive these same people out of the housing market?  He believes in the free market and does not tire of telling us so.  He believes in letting the market rip, but in this instance he has contributed in no small way to letting the genie out of the bottle.  He added fuel to the fire of rising house prices by cutting capital gains tax and now predictably and inevitably he is taking dramatically opposite measures to dampen the fire.  The Minister and his colleagues contributed to this fire by their action and inaction in recent times.  They have been too slow to do anything about it, nonetheless action now is better than no action at all and I support the measures proposed.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about the alleged dangers to the housing market, particularly the rented sector.  It has been suggested that the supply of apartments will dry up as builders get out of that sector or get out of the business altogether.  I find that proposition strange.  The cost of building materials and labour has scarcely increased in the past two years.  The price of new houses and apartments has increased because landowners are making more money and builders are making more profits.  Dr. Bacon in his report set out several practices such as the phased release of developments and gazumping which has clearly added to builders' profits.  There have been many examples in this city and elsewhere &mdash; we have seen examples in the past few days &mdash; where the first house built in an estate was substantially cheaper than the last house.  Nobody can seriously suggest that the cost to the builder has increased significantly in the meantime.  What has happened is very simple &mdash; builders have taken the opportunity to make a windfall profit. They have made a killing.</P>
    <P>If the measures proposed by the Minister are effective they will reduce the opportunity for supernormal profits.  If they do not have this effect, they will have failed.  To suggest that this would make it unprofitable to build apartment blocks or other units designed for rental use is patently absurd.  The profits available will still continue to be considerable for the foreseeable future.  It is possible that the demand for apartments will reduce as speculators look elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> It is also likely that the demand for apartments will reduce as people currently in the rental sector seek to buy houses.  All of us are agreed that the number of people seeking to rent as a matter of choice is increasing.  It is highly likely that the capital value of apartments &mdash; in simple terms, the price &mdash; will stabilise very quickly and could even fall, but surely that is not bad.  It will make apartments more affordable to the average purchaser and, more importantly, it will burst the speculative bubble before it has the opportunity to grow to an even more dangerous size.</P>
    <P>All of us are aware that the current position has become unsustainable.  Prices which are already high are being fed by the expectation of higher prices in the future.  This spiral was added to in no small measure by a series of untargeted, unfocused incentives paid for by the taxpayer. The position had become not only unsustainable but unconscionable.  The Minister is right to intervene and I support him in the measures he proposes in that regard.</P>
    <P>I said a couple of weeks ago that this country needs entrepreneurs.  It needs people who are willing to risk their money in order to manufacture goods, provide services and create jobs or allow others to do so.  We need risk takers, but passive investment in property involves no risk taking. The person borrows money, buys property and rents it out.  The interest costs are written off against income tax and the tenants pay the mortgage, with perhaps a little left over.  In the meantime the capital value of the property is appreciating and the person makes quite a few shillings when the property is sold.  That is not risk taking. It is not the investment we should encourage, and I support the Minister in his measures to take those people, at least temporarily, out of the housing market.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Environment and Local Government have said that the intention is to make targeted and limited use of section 23 relief in future years.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister for Finance in that regard.  He is right to make that statement, but in doing so he is stirring up trouble for his Department and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  All of us know from experience of local authorities what will happen.  All authorities, be they local authorities or development authorities, will seek to have section 23 available to them.  All the applications will build up on the desks of the Ministers for Finance and the Environment and Local Government and expectations will have to be dampened down.  It would have been simpler and more straightforward to say that from now on, with perhaps one or two exceptions, section 23 relief or its equivalent will not be available in the future.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a mixed bag.  I agree with some sections but not with others.  The measure to discourage passive investment in property is appropriate for the moment, although it may not be appropriate long term.  There may be occasions in <Col N="25" /> the future when once again the tax incentives that have been helpful to development in the past will be required.  Clearly those tax incentives are not currently necessary.  They have the opposite effect to what was intended.  I support the Minister in his measures to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed to deal with stamp duty are badly focused and targeted.  They should have been targeted at first time buyers and I will move an amendment to that effect.  As a matter of principle, the thresholds for stamp duty purposes should be index linked and I will also move an amendment to that effect.  Section 23 relief should have been abolished and in that regard also I intend to move an amendment.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bacon has done us a considerable service in carrying out a significant analysis of the housing market, what is driving demand and limiting supply.  The Minister has taken significant measures which will have limited success.  They could have been better focused and targeted.  I sincerely hope that the overall effect of these measures will be positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my support for the Government's initiative in introducing this legislation to reduce stamp duty on homes.  I agree with many of the positive steps taken to tackle house prices.  This Bill gives effect to those measures announced on 23 April.  It involves several remedial measures such as increased funding under the serviced land initiative to local authorities, reduction in investor demand and assistance for lower income buyers.</P>
      <P>As a nation we are unique in our desire to own our own homes.  There is a much higher percentage of private home ownership here than elsewhere in Europe.  Families of all income levels buy houses and apartments rather than rent them, and we must enable today's families to purchase their own homes, as their parents did.  Many of those who invest in their own homes take an onus off the State.  They provide houses for their families out of their own resources.  The number of houses built by local authorities is very much short of demand and this is influenced by the cost factor.  There are massive backlogs on housing lists, but they would be substantially greater if many of our people did not build or purchase their own homes.  This tradition ensures the demands on local authorities are kept within limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows how much it costs to build a house in 1998.  It has become an intolerable financial burden to embark upon home ownership. Most people finance 5 to 10 per cent of the cost of a new house from their savings.  They borrow 90 to 95 per cent and some take out a separate loan to pay the deposit.  Current housing costs result in astronomical repayments for the duration of the working lives of those who have the courage to take out a mortgage.  The burden is much greater in this decade than in previous decades.  This climate of massive financial commitment must inevitably influence the thinking of <Col N="26" /> those who wish to buy their own homes.  It will bring about major change in our collective thinking on home ownership, which now accounts for 80 per cent of all private residences.  We are pricing ourselves out of the era of the residential home owner.  There is no room in the Celtic tiger economy for the stay at home parent.  In the light of today's price structures both partners must be gainfully employed if they wish to keep their mortgage payments up to date and their heads above water.  A large slice of their combined income is committed to home repayments.  The result is severe financial pressure and related stress and tension in marriages and partnerships. This is a major social problem and any deferral of positive action could have catastrophic consequences.</P>
    <P>With regard to the unrestricted availability of money from institutions for home buyers, far more strict procedures should be in place to ensure that borrowers have the capacity to repay their loans in the coming years, particularly in the event of a slow down in the economy.  Otherwise I forecast repossessions on a large scale.  I agree with the recommendations of Members that financial institutions must offer 35 year mortgages with longer fixed interest rates at affordable levels.</P>
    <P>I note the views aired by Members of the Opposition.  They were vocal on the Government's delay in taking remedial action when they spoke on the stamp duty debate two weeks ago. I remind them that the Government took office last June and commissioned the Bacon report last November.  It has acted quickly and correctly. Many Members on the Opposition benches were in Government up to last June and they had ample opportunity to take action on this issue. House prices did not spiral out of control after 26 June last year, they have been out of control for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The Opposition also expressed strong doubts whether the moves will make houses cheaper.  I cannot gauge the final impact of the package of measures in the Bill on the affordability of homes.  However, we must give credit to the Fianna Fáil led Government for taking the first step to tackle the problems.  I hope the measures being introduced will tackle the problem and lead to a reduction in house prices.  We may have to take more action to help reduce the price of homes if these measures do not work.  If that proves necessary I am sure the Government will act. This medicine may be hard to swallow for the vested interests.</P>
    <P>House prices are fuelled by the high demand from people who wish to own their own homes and this causes a supply problem.  The cost of sites and construction, the easy availability of money and the builder's profit element are all factors. The builders and investors are not happy with the proposals to reduce radically the tax breaks for property investors who choose areas not in the integrated area plan areas which will be determined by the end of July.  People may decide to <Col N="27" /> leave their investments in building societies, banks, the post office or insurance policies.  They may not bother with property investment in the future.  Some investors are investing in properties in the UK.</P>
    <P>People will find alternative ways to ensure a return on their capital and this could have a negative impact on building and the availability of rented accommodation.  At present there is a high demand for rented residential properties for people leaving home at an earlier age, people moving to work in the main urban areas, students and people returning to work in Ireland.  Rental prices may increase if less accommodation is available due to a lack of investment in residential property.  I have been advised that 780 new residential units are needed each year in the Cork area to keep new entrants to the market supplied with rental accommodation.  The proposed abolition of interest relief would not only prevent these units coming on the market each year, it could also cause a depletion of the existing stock. We may see the loss of 1,000 rental units in Cork as a result of these measures.</P>
    <P>I made proposals to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, but I did not realise he was as tough as he is.  I suggested that he allow investors to continue to invest in apartments outside the IAP areas and to offset interest on borrowings allowable on a specific property against the rental income from that property.  I suggested as an alternative that he consider the introduction of a phased interest deductibility scheme over a five year sliding scale period.  I do not know whether I will be able to crack the Minister but I will not fall on my sword on this issue.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the measures the Minister is introducing and I am sure the Members opposite also appreciate his efforts.  I hope they will be successful and that investors will not be driven out of the market.  We may need to revisit this matter in a couple of years' time and examine new measures. However, I appreciate what the Minister seeks to achieve in taking the heat out of the market.</P>
    <P>There are some who maintain that builders and speculators are making massive profits and the legislation is being introduced because of the greed of some speculators.  They have looked for too much and have caused the market to go out of control.  I have been contacted by some builders and I know that this is the case in Dublin, which is the cause of the problem.  It does not exist to the same extent in other parts of the country.  The greed is in Dublin.  I wish we could introduce legislation for Dublin alone but that would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Builders have told me that their pricing levels have been strongly influenced by the cost of land. They may have bought land at a reasonable price some years ago but if they are developing it they must consider their next purchase of land which will be at a higher price.  I am informed that the cost of labour has increased by 25 per cent because it is difficult to find labour.  Builders must <Col N="28" /> compete in the labour market.  Materials have increased in price by 10 per cent and more for materials sourced in the UK given the strength of sterling.  The builders must pay their employees more to prevent them going elsewhere.  Some builders have told me that they have increased pay levels to all operatives in the trade by 25 per cent over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>In Cork a house measuring 1,200 square feet costs about £67,000.  An apartment in Cork costs about £120 per square foot whereas in Dublin it costs about £300 per square foot.  The prices in the capital are ludicrous.  Developers in Dublin are making huge profits.</P>
    <P>Many builders consider that the rezoning of agricultural land on the peripheries of urban areas should be undertaken immediately.  I agree strongly.  The availability of banks of cheaper land will inevitably decrease the price of building land and homes.  The local authorities are not blameless.  They must bear a burden of responsibility for contributing to the problem that exists.  Land must be rezoned on the peripheries of urban areas where there is high demand.  This is essential to reduce house prices.  I am in favour of the preservation of the countryside but this must not be done at the expense of citizens.  That is happening in the functional areas of Cork County Council.  The Cork Corporation area is surrounded by the county council area and it will not let the corporation expand.  All of the services are at the edge of the city but the county council has imposed a green belt right around the city and will not allow expansion or development of the functional area of Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>Much employment is in the major urban areas, and people want to live near their employment. However, Cork County Council planners prohibit the building of a home if the applicant for planning does not live within a radius of a mile and a half of the proposed site, that is in an A3 zone, and will grant building permission only to those who are direct descendants of the person who owns the land.  This is most restrictive and possibly unconstitutional.  I hope somebody will test it in the courts.  Such planning laws must be changed and changed quickly.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council has also said that if one lives in the county area, in a housing estate adjoining the city, one cannot move to an A3 zone, one and a half miles out, because one is not considered to be living in the county area.  This is ludicrous.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government should urgently review the county development plans with a view to allowing for city extensions and the freeing up of land banks.  Local authorities have an important role to play.  It is all very well to throw £30 million at the local authorities to service land, but if the planning policies are wrong and do not free up large tracts of land around cities, money will not solve the problem.  The focus should be on the local authorities and the role they must play.</P>
    <P>I repeat my support for this timely legislation. <Col N="29" /> These measures are important.  I hope even at this late hour, the Minister will take on board some of the points I made.  Will he look carefully at the planning and development plans of local authorities throughout the country, particularly those whose functional areas are outside large centres of population, and ensure that their plans include large tracts of rezoned land, even purchased by the local authorities and sold on to people so that they can build their own houses on it, so that more development can take place?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not entirely sure whether Deputy O'Flynn is arguing for a reversal of engines by the Minister in respect of Cork alone or whether he would apply the setting off of interest against borrowings in the rental sector to the rest of the jurisdiction.  It seems to be a plea for Cork and I have no doubt it will go down very well there.  However, I support the Minister.  The measures relating to the rental sector are essential and I am not persuaded by predictions from either side of the House of a nightmare in that sector a little way up the road.  I cannot see what would prevent the Minister returning to this issue should such a crisis emerge.  If there is one thing we have established over the past 15 years, it is that whenever money is tax sheltered there is a response from people who have money to provide accommodation of the kind we are talking about here.  The Minister has control in relation to reverting to that in due course.</P>
      <P>In the short-term this measure is absolutely necessary.  My regret is that it has taken the Minister and the Government so long to appreciate the extent and nature of the housing crisis.  It is a remarkable thing about Governments that it takes them so long to respond on major issues of public policy.  Deputy O'Flynn is not being fair.  It is true and accurate to say that this problem has escalated since 26 June.  There was price escalation before 26 June, but what we have seen in the past six or seven months is unprecedented even in the neighbouring island when there was a similar boom under Mrs. Thatcher with tragic consequences for very many people.  It is a recent phenomenon, and it really is remarkable that the measures proposed in relation to stamp duty and in respect of section 23 relief were not introduced in the budget.  That was the place and the time to do it.  I am quite sure the Minister's advisers did not need Peter Bacon's proposals to make them aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely regrettable that the Minister is now trying to catch up with the runaway horse. Deputy O'Flynn said that developers in this city, meaning Dublin, are making huge profits. Nobody can gainsay that.  The extent of profiteering is something we have never before experienced.  We have the tangible example of yesterday's High Court case involving a young couple in my constituency who bought a house &mdash; thought they had bought a house &mdash; off the plans for £129,000, to be built in a part of my constituency in Tallaght.  Some three and a half months <Col N="30" /> later they were advised by the builder that the cost of that house would now be £165,000.  That is an increase of £36,000 or 28 per cent.  Nobody could seriously try to justify such an increase in less than four months.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Flynn is wrong about labour costs and about the effect of the fluctuating pound.  The whole merit of the building industry is that materials for it are substantially sourced in the domestic economy.  The extent to which the strength of sterling affects that is minimal enough. To suggest that in a climate of pay restraint and Partnership 2000 there are labour cost increases of 20 per cent is nonsense.  The house price building index to end of December l997 shows a figure of 3.8 per cent.  How that can be set against the kind of profiteering we are seeing, I do not know. There is no explanation for it other than profit taking of an order we have never seen before. One of the Sunday newspapers &mdash; I cannot remember which &mdash; had an article about a recent auction where the builder went down along the queue, and by the time he had got halfway down the queue the price of the house had gone up by £10,000.  That is unconscionable activity, and it is going on.</P>
    <P>In my constituency experience, yesterday's decision in the High Court was not in respect of one house or one builder.  That practice is more widespread and Mr. Justice McCracken and the Director of Consumer Affairs have since acknowledged this to be the case.  Nothing in the package of measures brought in by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, or the Minister for Finance in this Bill will deal with that phenomenon.  The Government is avoiding its responsibility in not addressing it.  It is straightforward opportunist profit taking to such an excessive extent it ought to be outlawed.</P>
    <P>A number of auctioneers have been in touch with me since the decision in the High Court and they said some auctioneers deliberately set out to circumvent the normal provisions of contract law in terms of the manner in which they construct the paperwork for taking deposits or booking fees.  If the Minister offers to sell me his house at a certain consideration and I accept that, there is normally a contract if I pay a deposit, which is usually capable of being enforced in the courts. However, in this case the auctioneers set out in writing to expressly exclude the existence of a contract by indicating the booking fee was no more than an indication of interest.  The Minister cannot permit that situation to continue as it is intolerable.  Auctioneers who engage in that practice for excessive profit taking ought to be the subject of whatever measures the Government thinks most appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bacon report hints at widening the scope of the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and, perhaps, that is the way to go.  At the rate we are going in terms of supervising banks and auctioneers the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be the largest regulatory office <Col N="31" /> in the State very shortly.  Whenever the Cabinet gets into trouble over a bank helping itself to one's few bob and the Director of Consumer Affairs is seen on television, he constitutes the main part of the Government response in subsequent press statements.  Mr. William Fagan is the main hope between us and such profiteering.</P>
    <P>However, in this regard using the director is the correct approach.  Will the Minister put himself in the position of a young couple who genuinely believed they purchased a house, entered into a valid contract and that the booking deposit was part of that contract?  Will he further imagine their disappointment when four months later they find out no contract existed and that in the interim the price spiralled by 28 per cent?  That is an unconscionable position and is not addressed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I refer to the supply and demand analysis.  It does not allow for the consideration that the distortion of demand is very significant as a result of the extent of the proportion of purchase for investment purposes.  Not even the Bacon report can tell us the huge proportion involved, which is estimated to be between 25 per cent and 40 per cent.  It is not a supply phenomenon and the other factor not taken into account by the analysis is the extent to which these purchases are made with cash.  Any individual with his or her ears open around town can tell the Minister stories about that.  That was fuelled significantly by the Minister through his decision to cut capital gains tax in the budget from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>That freed up money and people to realise their assets paying half the tax for which they normally would have been liable and as a result they entered the market in such a fashion that they now provide serious competition for genuine home seekers who, in many cases, are first time buyers.  It is a huge proportion of the market and distorts demand.  It is not taken into account by simply saying it is a demand and supply problem and more land and houses must be made available.  It is not that simple and the CGT decision has driven this investor phenomenon.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that at budget time the Minister explained the merits of his unprecedented reduction in capital gains tax.  It is an area where he will get full credit because it will emerge in time that his officials and the Department never advocated such a measure.  Incidentally, no other body advocated it in public either.  It will be seen as a &ldquo;McCreevyism&rdquo; and there is no doubt the Minister will get paternity of it.  Of course, he has supporters for that very reason but it was a mistake.  He set out the rationale for it in the House in response to speeches by Deputy Higgins <i>(Dublin West)</i> and others by stating development was not included under this provision because huge profits were already being made on such land.  He is on the record several times inside and outside the House making that point.</P>
    <P>A few months later development is included and we are aware of the lobby that sprung up <Col N="32" /> among developers as to why they were not included when this measure was announced. Now, it transpires they are included.</P>

      <P>Correct, but the Deputy is entering the area of developers also.  It is of no benefit to a developer because it is a tradable activity and, thereby, subject to corporation tax at the appropriate rate, which is more than 20 per cent.  It is of benefit to those to whom the Deputy now refers if they comply with this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's intervention and stand corrected for my too loose use of the term &ldquo;developer&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan raised an interesting point about the number of cases where the owner is the developer.  I am not persuaded by his argument that tying the concession to the planning process is wrong.  We must have some yardstick.  Tying it to the planning process will not prove as awkward as Deputy Noonan suggested.  I was chairman of the largest local authority in the country at one stage, Dublin County Council, where we would rezone more land in one day than Deputy <Col N="33" /> O'Flynn would rezone in the whole of Cork in a year.  Of course some people on the council believed we should not rezone any land, but that is impractical in an expanding city with demographic changes and increased employment. Enormous profits are made at the rezoning stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why people who have been the beneficiaries of enormous windfall profits at the rezoning stage should also qualify for a halving of their capital gains tax liability.  I presume Deputy Noonan will elaborate on his point on Committee Stage, but the farmers with whom I dealt when I was chairman of Dublin County Council are not as backward as one might infer from Deputy Noonan's contribution.  They are as aware as most developers of the prospect of a hotel on a field and will have no difficulty finding a partner.  There is plenty of expertise around the city and in this House to guide them down that road.  While the Minister is probably correct to link this concession to the planning process, he should not revisit capital gains tax to do nothing more than confer yet another windfall of profit on landowners.  I will not get involved in another semantic dispute about developers and owners; it will become a blurred area when this Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he introduced this measure because Dr. Bacon recommended it.  He also recommended the abolition of stamp duty on second-hand houses for first time buyers, but the Minister failed to do that.  I do not know what kind of a bothán he thinks one could buy for £60,000.  It is not possible to buy a house for that price in this city.</P>
      <P>There is a deliberate conspiracy between certain large auctioneers and property developers to skew the market away from home ownership to the rental sector, and the Minister's intervention in that regard is welcome.  I would let this measure run until the shoe pinches, but I do not know if that will happen.  There is a move towards the continental style of a greater proportion of rental accommodation than home ownership, but it is not necessarily good for society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill which will have the effect of providing cheaper housing and more land for development. We have one of the highest levels of home ownership in the world.  The Minister stated that the goal of home ownership might be pushed beyond the reach of a significant portion of people who aspire to own their own houses and the Government is not prepared to countenance this.  I agree with that aspiration and if the Bill has that effect, it must be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to allow first time buyers easier access to the market and to free up second-hand homes for sale.  In other words, it will increase housing affordability.  According to the April-May edition of <i>Housing Times</i>, housing <Col N="34" /> affordability is approaching 1992 levels.  In other words, it is becoming more difficult to afford a house, as was the case in 1992.  However, the factors underlying the current low levels of affordability are different from those that prevailed in 1992 when there were high interest rates during the currency crisis.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons for the current low levels of affordability.  The significant increase in the demand for housing has not been met by a sufficient increase in supply.  This is placing an upward pressure on prices.  Increasing employment opportunities, particularly in Dublin, competition for skilled labour and the tendency of large multinationals to headhunt technical experts have resulted in increased incomes and opportunities for people.  If people have more disposable income they can afford to pay higher prices.  The recent tax cuts, targeted mainly at middle and upper income earners, will also enable people to buy more expensive houses and thus push up prices.  As referred to in the Bacon report and by Deputy Noonan, there has been an increase in the number of people in the 25 to 45 age category where the demand for housing is highest.  The baby boom of the 1960s and 1970s is affecting the housing market, education and so on.  Also, many of our emigrants who went to America and England in the 1980s, when there was large-scale emigration, are returning to buy licensed premises, shops and houses.  They are investing the money they earned abroad for their security when they return.  That is another factor pushing up prices.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the effect of interest rates.  In 1992 a large number of people could not afford to buy houses because interest rates soared after the currency crisis.  Matters are now different and by the time the euro in introduced in January 1999 our interest rates will have to reach the lower levels prevailing in continental Europe. This has given rise to an overall expectation of lower interest rates and, therefore, lower borrowing costs, which is fuelling the high prices being paid for houses.  The euro has been sold to us on the basis that there would be lower interest rates, which is one reason the nation and all sides of the House have accepted it so positively. People are confident this will happen and they are factoring it into their budgeting for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister highlighted the shortage of serviced land, which means the housing supply is not keeping pace with the growth in demand, which in turn leads to rises in house prices.  Some economic commentators suggest that 46,000 new houses per annum will be needed to cope with the increase in demand but in 1997 there were only 38,384 house completions, which was the highest ever figure.  If we do not have enough serviced land to meet this demand, which we do not, the problem will get worse.  I welcome the measures contained in the overall package to provide incentives for people to service sites, etc., and the partnership approach adopted by local authorities and private investors.  However, there <Col N="35" /> may not be enough serviced land, as opposed to rezoned land, available.  It is one thing to rezone land but another to service it, and that is a problem throughout the country.  Today's debate has concentrated on Dublin and the larger urban areas but there are many villages which could provide cheaper housing and sites if they had sewerage services, for instance.  It should be national policy to provide sewage treatment works throughout the country because it is important for rural development.  Such development may be inhibited by the absence of proper sewage treatment facilities, as the land may not be suitable for large tanks or septic tanks may not be allowed.</P>
    <P>As I said, housing affordability this year and next will be largely influenced by the lower interest rates which will result from the introduction of the euro.  I have some reservations about the Bill but its provisions, coupled with lower interest rates, will make housing more affordable and one hopes they will reverse the current trend whereby prices are getting out of reach.</P>
    <P>Reputable sources feel the proposal to abolish interest relief on mortgages taken out for the purpose of residential investment will have consequences for the national economy, the building industry and the rental market.  It could undermine the potential benefits of the measures I have welcomed.  It has been stated Government policy for many years to improve the standard and supply of private rented accommodation.  The private sector has responded positively to this policy, in both the designated and the non-designated areas.  Much of the development in our larger urban areas has been driven by private investors, but for whom accommodation would not be available to many young people, students, nurses, etc. The new proposal will set the sector back by diminishing the incentives &mdash; it will act as a discouragement.  When the rental spiral commences as a result of the inevitable supply shortage it will be difficult to retrieve the position.  The Minister's party and some of his supporters in the building industry are spinning the line that we can revisit this in a year's time and that after house price rises have been dampened and the market has stabilised, we can reverse some of these proposals.  However, when provisions are put in place it is hard to reverse them and unless they are modified on Committee Stage we will have to live with them for some time.</P>
    <P>There is an established requirement of a minimum of 11,000 new residential units on the letting market each year.  Over 3,000 of these are in Dublin.  They meet the demands of such groups as emigrants returning to take up employment, people from Ireland and abroad working on short-term contracts, students, young people setting up home and retired people selling family homes.  Many of these people rent by choice, others out of necessity.  Almost everyone enters the rental market at some point and it is particularly prevalent at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> I am in general agreement with the Bill but it is not right to kill off investors.  The proposed abolition of interest reliefs will make it uneconomic for them to become involved in residential property in future.  Perhaps the Minister could do something to allay their fears when replying to Second Stage.  The statistics are discouraging because when borrowings are considered this will become a loss making activity &mdash; a loss of £32,000 will be incurred on a £100,000 property over a 15 year period if this provision is enacted.  Even the Bacon report admits that, given changing patterns of demand for private rented accommodation, it is desirable that investors should enter the market and provide greater range and depth to this segment of the housing market than was previously available.</P>
    <P>The emergence of broadly based investment interest in the housing market has had very beneficial results in terms of broadening the range and quality of rented accommodation.  There is a conflict in what the Minister is trying to do and the effect it could have on the people who have been providing necessary accommodation in the past.  If the investors do not provide the 11,000 new residential units needed this year and each subsequent year, who will?  From where will this investment come?  Because of these provisions, will people provide this accommodation for themselves without the influence of any investor?</P>
    <P>As has been mentioned by a number of speakers, immediate pressure will be put on local authority housing lists and on State funding and involvement.  Deputies who are members of local authorities will know &mdash; I am no longer a member of a local authority &mdash; that the housing budget for this year has been decreased in most local authorities.  Fewer houses have been provided this year than in the past three years.  That is certainly the case in Kerry and I am sure it is uniform for the rest of the country.  There is no framework in place to deal with this problem if it has the effect to which I referred on investors in new residential units.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Noonan pointed out this morning, the shortage in rental accommodation will commence within a few months and could rise rapidly.  It is not an exaggeration to say it could double in 18 months.  This need not happen if a balanced approach is taken now to the problems in the housing sector.  Generally, the Irish investor market is made up of small investors, 95 per cent of whom are ordinary people seeking a type of pension for the future and some security for their families.  The vast majority of them are in the market for long-term investment and not short-term gain.  I know people have made enormous amounts of money in recent times through speculation but generally the majority of people in this market have not made large sums of money but merely guaranteed their security for the future.  It must be recognised that the small investor is playing a vital and unrecognised role in funding the modernisation of our national housing stock. <Col N="37" /> Considerable efforts have been made over the past 17 years in bringing our rental accommodation up to European standards.  It is recognised that the job is only 60 per cent completed and that at least 40,000 substandard units need to be replaced with high quality modern accommodation.  This provision may dampen that enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>To avoid stamp duty first-time buyers must be the owner-occupier of the house for five years.  If they decide to rent the house, they will have to pay stamp duty.  Also, the current trend is to buy a house and allow a relative or a family friend rent a room to help pay the mortgage.  In that event, I understand the first time buyer will have to pay stamp duty.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position on that.</P>
    <P>Work patterns are changing.  People move around a great deal in their work be they public servants, nurses, gardaí, teachers and even those working for multinational companies in Dublin, who may move back to the parent company for a period.  This provision will present difficulties for that category of people and I would like the Minister to clarify it.  I may be wrong in my interpretation but clarification is needed in relation to stamp duty as it applies to the first-time buyer.</P>
    <P>Generally I welcome the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope they will dampen the market and allow a large number of the population, especially young people, to have the opportunity to own their own houses, which is very much part of our culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people will welcome achievement of the objectives of the Finance (No. 2) Bill to ensure Ireland continues to enjoy a high level of home ownership.  A genuine concern has been expressed about the cost of purchasing a house.  I will focus on the constituency I represent, Dublin North Central.  House prices have spiralled out of control in recent years and I would welcome any measures that will help slow that escalation and thereby give young people an opportunity to purchase their first home.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the measures in the Bill are necessary to ensure a balance is restored to this market and that, more importantly, the sharp increase in house prices is addressed.  Most of us will be aware of the debate that has taken place since these measures were announced on 23 April.  Some economic consultants have indicated that balance needs to be restored in other markets also.  If the Government can address the problems in the housing market, I would like to think it will focus on the other markets also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues have been brought to my attention by the Irish Home Builders' Association, and other authorities, with regard to certain aspects of the proposals and their likely impact on the marketplace.  When I became involved in public representation in the Dublin area, Dublin was facing a crisis and there was little or no development in the city.  The skyline we now enjoy in the city and, more importantly, the confidence of investors to invest is the result <Col N="38" /> of a great deal of hard work, dedication and encouragement.  I am concerned that some of the proposals in the Bill may impact on that confidence.  If that happens, it will not be easily restored.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the line being used that the proposals will be reversed in the near future, but some clarity is needed.  Are these merely short-term measures to be introduced for a certain period?  I would welcome the Minister clarifying that aspect.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the rapid escalation in house prices in recent years has had adverse implications for first time buyers.  All of us in this House are familiar with young couples who want to be home owners and who meet the various criteria that heretofore would give them that opportunity but who, because of rising house prices and other criteria imposed by financial institutions, are unable to meet that criteria and purchase their homes.  The case has been highlighted of the couple who paid a booking deposit on a house costing £129,000.  When they tried to conclude the deal they found the builder sought an increased price for the property.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to this coin.  If a person enters a contract, a binding agreement, whereby the person cannot walk away from it and the builder was aware the property was sold and that nobody would renege on the deal, the price should not be increased.  If, on the other hand, there was a loose arrangement, the individual could walk away and get a return of his or her deposit.  Some speakers referred to the need for proper arrangements to be put in place.  This could be easily addressed by means of a simple regulation which either the Department of Finance or the Department of the Environment and Local Government might put in place.  This would be a standardised agreement whereby people would be aware the booking deposit was non-refundable, in the event of the deal not going ahead, and the agreed purchase price would remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to my attention that developers, as in any normal practice, have to maintain a balance between the moneys coming in and those going out to ensure the continued development of their business.  I refer to a builder selling a property and buying other property for development purposes.  The cost of the green field sites, whether rezoned for residential purposes, has to be tied in to his overall business practices.  This is the reason for the increase in house prices.  I hope some of the measures regarding supply can address the escalation in site prices which, in turn, had the domino effect of the increase in house prices.</P>
    <P>I welcome the two priorities for addressing the housing issue, one of which is the question of affordability of housing, especially for lower income groups.  In this instance I refer to the shared ownership scheme which has huge potential.  There is a need for more flexibility in respect of the criteria in place.  While I appreciate the <Col N="39" /> proposals in the Bill regarding income levels other matters need to be considered.</P>
    <P>Last Monday night, as a member of Dublin City Council, I had the opportunity to discuss the matter with the assistant city manager with responsibility for this scheme in Dublin Corporation.  The reason I posed the question was that a constituent brought to my attention his application for shared ownership and the rejection of his application by the clerical officer dealing with it at the counter who indicated he was wasting his time in making an application since he had been a previous house owner.  In society today we are all too familiar with a number of people, married, single or with a partner, who have had the joyful experience of owning a property and where for one reason or another &mdash; a breakdown in a relationship, a change in financial circumstances and so on &mdash; the house has to be sold.  A number of years later that individual, or one of the partners of a joint venture, has the opportunity to again purchase but because of financial restrictions may be restricted as to the level of mortgage they can repay and thus a shared ownership option would be ideal.</P>
    <P>Following my contact with the assistant city manager I was advised to bring the case to his attention and that it would receive favourable consideration.  I am concerned that a number of people who go directly to the public offices of local authorities are being advised that because they owned a previous house they cannot be entertained under the shared ownership scheme. That needs to be changed.  It may require a direction from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to all local authorities asking them to show maximum flexibility in relation to the shared ownership option to ensure the optimum potential from the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the publication of the Bacon report, with the Government's speedy response, will help take much of the heat out of the market. Furthermore, it is hoped that this package will restore a degree of clarity between the various market participants, i.e. the owner-occupier and the investor.  I have concerns regarding investors in the marketplace and the role they played in the development of Dublin City in recent times and about section 23s.  This step will shape the market. It is a mechanism that is blatantly distorting the market, particularly in regard to an investor.  The investor has to be recognised as providing accommodation, where currently accommodation is not provided by the statutory authorities, the local authorities, who are charged with the responsibility of providing housing, and the many other categories who avail of housing through the rent supplement scheme.  This includes the large number of students who would not be in a position to purchase a property, nor would they wish to because they may need rented accommodation only for job experience, training, college or other short-term requirements.  That would not warrant owner-occupier first time buyer house purchase <Col N="40" /> by the individual and they would not be in a financial position to do so.  Most of us are aware of people in this category who are in training, temporary employment, attending college etc., and who would join other like-minded individuals in renting a property.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to areas identified as causing overheating and to bottlenecks and distortions in the housing market. However, while some of these provisions are welcome, they will distort the market.  Measures to increase the potential supply of housing, dampen excessive investor demand and help restore a balance between supply and demand are welcome, but I am not sure how the balance between supply and demand can be restored when there is a demand for rental accommodation and where the investor has played an important role in supplying it.  The measures taken to improve the position of prospective first time buyers are also welcome, provided they work.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the question of deductibility of interest on investment property with the Minister and officials from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is regrettable that there has been a move from full to zero deductibility.  There was room for manoeuvre here.</P>
    <P>The transitional arrangements, originally set for 30 September this year, have now been put back to December.  While I welcome this, the changes to these arrangements only relate to the purchase of the property.  Most people who purchase a property on the basis of investment have to undertake repairs and alterations.  It makes common sense to provide for transitional arrangements.  Allowing for the usual legal transactions, which can take four to six weeks, a property purchased in March could be liable for the transitional arrangements, which take effect from 23 April.  However, after the person becomes legal owner he is required to undertake repairs and alterations to ensure the property is fit for the rental market.  Revenue must recognise that there is a need for appropriate transitional arrangements.</P>
    <P>On the question of repair, the explanatory memorandum states the restriction regarding premises purchased for the purpose of rental income does not apply in the case of:</P>
    <P>(1) borrowed money employed on or after 23 April, 1998, but before 31 December, 1998, in the purchase of property under a contract evidenced in writing entered into before 23 April, 1998.</P>
    <P>(2) borrowed money employed on or after 23 April, 1998 in the improvement or repair of a residential premises which in the 12 months to 23 April, 1998 was a rented premises and which was owned on 23 April, 1998 by the person in receipt of rental income or was purchased by him or her before 31 December, 1998 under a contract evidenced in writing entered into before 23 April, 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> Appropriate transitional arrangements, however restricted, must be made which recognise the need for that kind of investment.  In addition, I will closely monitor developments in the commercial market, where escalating prices may occur following the distortion in the private home market.</P>
    <P>I welcome the alteration in stamp duty rates. The previous Government took a retrograde step when it increased them.  I ask the Minister for Finance or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to join me on a tour of my constituency of Dublin North-Central and show me which of my constituents will benefit from the zero exemption on properties valued up to £60,000.  There are none.  Given this, and the somewhat unique position of the Dublin area, there should be some recognition of the fact that my constituents cannot avail of that exemption.  I hope the provisions on density do not include infill development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no difficulty with the Government's objectives, I am not sanguine about its approach.  The question of affordability of housing, especially for lower income families and young people must be an essential political objective of all Members of this House.  The spiralling prices for residential accommodation, be it houses or apartments, in the past 18 months, especially in the city and county of Dublin defies any rational logistical explanation in the context of the building of new houses.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the strategy adopted by the Government is seriously flawed.  This legislation is riddled with anomalies which will have to be dramatically amended in next year's Finance Bill.  The Bill is being rushed through the House to meet a crisis that could have been addressed in a more considered way by the Minister in the budget and in the Finance Act, 1998. The proposal to take Committee Stage tomorrow is unfortunate because it means there will be no time to reflect on the anomalies, which will create difficulties.  They need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>While the Bacon report is useful, it is not set in tablets of stone.  I do not fully accept all of the analysis set out in the report, nor do I accept that the provisions in this Bill will in any substantial way ease the pressure on house prices or make it easier for young married couples to purchase, especially in the Dublin area with which I am most familiar, although similarly burgeoning problems are arising in Galway, Cork and Limerick and in some of the other growing urban areas, such as Drogheda and Dundalk, which are becoming satellite towns of Dublin.  The Bill will not solve these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the Government has not come to terms with the problems in the marketplace was starkly and sadly shown by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, last night in response to the issue raised on the Adjournment by Deputy Rabbitte.  It is astonishing that the Minister did not mention this issue in his brief contribution.  If the question is <Col N="42" /> the affordability of housing, it must be an objective of this House to ensure developers do not charge prices for the houses they are constructing that are outrageously out of synch with their achieving a reasonable as opposed to exorbitant level of profit.</P>
    <P>The case reported in the newspapers yesterday involving the Durkan building group is a stark example of the unacceptable face of the construction industry as we approach the end of the century.  The self-serving and insensitive remarks made in justification by the representative of the housing construction industry about the issue in the past 24 hours are an indicator that the industry has no insight into its responsibilities and obligation to behave in a decent way towards its customers.  I get the impression it is its view that it should make as much profit and get as much benefit as possible from the current housing market without a reasonable assessment with regard to profit.  This is particularly nauseating bearing in mind where we stood five or six years ago when the industry had difficulties and looked to this House to put in place specific special legislative measures to stimulate the market.  Deputies were told &mdash; this was acknowledged &mdash; that they had a responsibility in this area.  In boom times the industry has its duties and obligations which extend to behaving in a decent and reasonable way towards its customers and, in particular, not gazumping young people seeking to buy houses. It is clear from all the comments made in the past 24 hours that there is an urgent need for legislation in this area, a need which the Government has yet to accept or acknowledge.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, appeared to suggest last night and the Minister implied in his contribution that the proposed measures will in some way place the customer, the potential purchaser of a new house, in a position of greater equality than builders.  That is nonsense.  In the construction industry there is a capacity to build and make available on existing zoned residential land far more residential houses than are currently being put on the market.  Builders are deliberately staggering developments, putting small numbers of houses on the market to create and stimulate hysteria about a housing shortage and up prices to levels for which there is no justification.  Why are they doing this?  The Bacon report has not identified all the reasons.  It does not derive from the fact that housing investors are in the market.  While I have no doubt that the availability of section 23 relief has resulted in too many properties in section 23 developments going to investors, there was huge resistance on the part of young people to buy accommodation for occupation in city centre areas.  Much of the regeneration which has taken place along the quays, Temple Bar and elsewhere would not have come about without investors.</P>
    <P>The housing market is being fuelled by a combination of historically low interest rates which are set to fall even lower, a population bulge of a nature we have not experienced for many years <Col N="43" /> and an economy in which the vast majority of young people are staying at home to obtain jobs. A substantial number of emigrants are returning, a considerable number from the United Kingdom for whom housing in Ireland is much cheaper because of the punt-sterling differential.  In the past 12 months the cost has been between 15 per cent and 20 per cent lower.  This social demographic and financial environment will continue to fuel the housing market.</P>
    <P>The price of new houses, particularly in Dublin, will not fall as a result of the proposed measures. I would be happy to be proved wrong in that prediction.  It may be the case that in what are perceived to be the less desirable parts of the city no new apartments will be built &mdash; some of these developments were aimed at investors only, not owner-occupiers &mdash; but when it comes to young people gaining access to new houses there will not be a dramatic or steady reduction in the cost which will continue to rise throughout the year and the proposed measures will not have an impact.</P>
    <P>I have always been very much in favour of a free market but people are now being exploited to an unacceptable degree.  We should consider measures that would allow reasonable profits to be made by those constructing new houses but which would prevent them exploiting their dominant position by artificially controlling the number of new houses coming on the market thereby adding to the continuing upsurge in prices.</P>
    <P>Legislation must be introduced to deal with the scandal spotlighted by the case involving the Durkan building group.  Young people are asked on building sites to pay booking deposits which are sought by developers in the knowledge that the persons putting down the deposits are not bound to purchase until contracts are signed.  The booking deposit was a sign of comfort to a developer putting houses on the market.  It gave him an immediate insight into the numbers of people genuinely interested in purchasing houses.  A substantially high number of those who put down booking deposits ultimately sign contracts. Within a couple of weeks of booking deposits being handed over &mdash; I say this as a solicitor whose firm practices in this area &mdash; developers had the facility to have their lawyers send out contracts to be signed.  The booking deposit was regarded by young people as a commitment that the developer would furnish the contract within a couple of weeks to purchase the house.  They also knew the purchase price.</P>
    <P>Booking deposits have played an important role.  It is only in recent months that developers have started to a great degree gazumping those who have put down booking deposits.  This has not been happening for years.  It is a new development over the past 12 months.  Up to now developers received booking deposits and their solicitors sent out contracts for purchase.  Obviously, if the person who paid the booking deposit did not sign the contract to purchase within a reasonable <Col N="44" /> time, the developer was free to sign contracts with other people and did so.  If the prospective purchaser did not sign the contract within a reasonable period after it was sent out, such as a week or a fortnight, a solicitor's letter would be sent to the purchaser's solicitor stating that the contract would be withdrawn if it was not signed within seven days.  Everybody had notice of the position.  However, this is a new and unacceptable development.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that people put down booking deposits for a house with a price of £120,000 or £130,000 only to be told two or three months later that if they wanted to buy the house, it would cost them £170,000.  The reasons advanced by the Durkan brothers in the recent case in the courts were entirely spurious.  There is no question of the cost of building materials or the construction of the house increasing by £34,000 in three months.  The company gazumped people who put down booking deposits for no other reason than it saw the market marching on and it wanted to make an even greater profit.  I assume a substantial profit was built into the original price of the house for which the booking deposit was paid.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to introduce legislation to ensure that when a sum of money is paid as a booking deposit, the developer who takes it is obliged to furnish contracts for the purchase of the house to the people who paid the deposit within two weeks of receipt of the deposit.  The people who paid the deposit and received the contracts for sale should be entitled as a matter of law to purchase the house for the price stated at the time the booking deposit was paid provided they sign the contracts for purchase within three weeks of receiving them.  This is a reasonable proposal which will ensure that people who put down booking deposits have the possibility of entering binding legal arrangements within a reasonable time of paying the deposit.  It will prevent by statutory provision developers gazumping people as in the recent case.  It is outrageous that the Government has not recognised the need for such legislation.  It is scandalous that it is so sanguine about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance appears to believe this problem will go away.  However, it will not go away and I predict the measures in this Bill will not resolve the difficulties.  I disagree with the decrease in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent on the sale of development land.  This will not make houses cheaper, only allow people to make more profits.  No research in the Bacon report indicates that the change in capital gains tax will have any impact on house prices.  It is a wish; the Government hopes it will happen. However, it will not happen and the move is not justified when one considers the huge windfall profits made by people when land is rezoned by local authorities.  They perform a function in rezoning which is frequently and deliberately misunderstood and about which misleading remarks are made.  However, the social justice involved <Col N="45" /> was that ultimately a reasonable sum was paid in capital gains tax.  This tax on development land should not be reduced from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  It will not help remotely young house purchasers but it may help supporters of Fianna Fáil in the construction industry.  I have no illusions that it may also help supporters of Fine Gael in that industry, but a Fianna Fáil led Government is bringing in this measure under the guise that it will help young house purchasers.  That will not be the case.</P>
    <P>The legislation is poorly drafted in relation to dealing with people who live in residential accommodation and subsequently decide to rent their houses.  There appears to be a perception that if a person has lived in residential accommodation for a number of years and then rents out the property, he or she should be deprived of mortgage interest relief previously received.  The Government's rationale for this move is that it wants to help young people to purchase houses. However, there is no connection between the two.</P>
    <P>For example, a man working for a multinational company has been living in the family home for six years but the multinational company requires him to go to Oklahoma to work for the next two years and he must take his wife and family with him.  He wants to keep his house in Dublin because he intends to return to the city.  He does not want to sell the property but he also does not want to leave it unoccupied.  What should he do?  Thousands of people in this situation rent out their houses while they are abroad.  The rental income helps to discharge the mortgage and interest while they are away.  In addition, when people go abroad they are usually involved in renting further accommodation.</P>
    <P>These people will be deprived of their mortgage interest relief.  There is no basis for such a move and it will create an inflexibility in employment.  What about civil servants who work for Departments and are posted to Brussels or elsewhere to represent the State on temporary assignments? They rent out their houses because they want to return to Dublin eventually.  What about a deserted wife who has a family home for which she is paying a mortgage?  She may decide she wants to stay in the house with her young family but she will convert it into two apartments.  She and her family will live in one and she will rent out the other.  She will be deprived of mortgage interest relief.</P>
    <P>The measure is a blunt instrument which has not been thought through.  It will create many difficulties for many people.  There is no social benefit and it will not remotely help a single young person or married couple to purchase a new house.  I urge the Minister to reconsider the provisions between now and Committee Stage because he has not thought them through.  Other anomalies and problems arise but I do not have time to deal with them all.</P>
    <P>For once I agree with the previous speaker on <Col N="46" /> the Fianna Fáil benches that if we want to help young married couples, particularly in cities, the stamp duty rates should be changed more dramatically.  Nobody in Dublin can buy any type of property for £60,000.  If we want to help young married couples, the stamp duty rate in Dublin should cover houses up to £120,000 which is now the going rate.  Less than three years ago extraordinarily modest houses could have been purchased for between £65,000 and £75,000.  I welcome the changes in stamp duty but they do not go far enough.  They do not take realistic account of the true price of housing in the cities and main urban centres throughout the country.  I have no doubt that it will be necessary to return to this issue in the Finance Bill next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 1 to 7 together.  Since taking office, I have met with two parliamentary delegations &mdash; the US parliamentary delegation in November and the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in March.</P>
      <P>Over the next two months, I plan to visit Spain on 25 May, Austria on 3 and 4 June, the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on Drugs on 8 June and Portugal on 9 June.  I will also attend the European Council meeting in Cardiff on 15 and 16 June.</P>
      <P>I had a brief meeting with Mr. Yevgeni Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, on Thursday, 7 May.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs also attended the meeting.  We discussed bilateral economic trade and Russian-EU relations.  I took the opportunity of the meeting to press for an early lifting of the current restrictions on the export into Russia of beef from certain counties.</P>
      <P>I also discussed my proposed visit to Russia this year with Mr. Primakov.  While no dates have yet been confirmed for this visit, I hope to travel to Russia in the autumn, possibly during September. In addition to meeting political leaders, I would hope to meet a number of business leaders.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Council Meeting of 2 May on Economic and Monetary Union, Deputies will be aware that I made a comprehensive statement on this issue in the House on Wednesday last, 6 May.</P>
      <P>I have endorsed the Amsterdam Treaty in the course of a variety of engagements, most recently in addressing the Institute of European Affairs and the April meeting of the EU Heads of Mission.  As part of my extensive political campaign, I will join other party leaders on 14 May to campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  I will take every opportunity that arises to encourage a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote for both referenda.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given many interviews on this issue and I reiterate that the drafters of this agreement succeeded in putting people's issues on its agenda.  They did so with a range of issues such as employment and disability.  Crime and drug trafficking have also been successfully addressed.  Research shows that these are meaningful issues that affect people's lives and by dealing with them the Amsterdam Treaty focused on everyday life.  That is an important reason which shows those who are not over committed to the European agenda that the treaty is a positive measure.  I cannot claim credit for negotiating the agreement.  Deputy Bruton negotiated it and he succeeded in bringing people's issues to the agenda.  That is why I am confirmed in my view that it is a very constructive agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's remarks about the previous Government's negotiation of the treaty, and I agree with everything he has said.  Does he not agree that probably the most important argument in favour of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote is the fact that the Amsterdam Treaty provides for the expansion of the European Union in order to bring in eastern countries, thus ensuring that the zone of peace in western Europe can be extended?  That peace has given us 50 years without war in comparison with the first 50 years of the century, which were marred by war.  This treaty and the development of European integration guarantees the possibility of peace in Europe for the next generation and for generations to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy on stability and enlargement.  I recently read papers on EU enlargement from 1989 while preparing for a meeting.  When considering the limited nature of what was envisioned the success of what has been achieved is clearer.  Many of the countries which seek to join the EU are so anxious to do so that they are implementing drastic structural reforms to qualify for membership.</P>
      <P>Ireland has benefited enormously from membership, but I resent those who reduce our membership benefits to money.  We have benefited from market access as well as employment and investment opportunities.  This is why farmers, trade unionists and community bodies strongly support the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that many Unionists in Northern Ireland are very apprehensive about the 22 May referendum? They feel, rightly or wrongly, that the tide is going against them with the agreement.  If the Taoiseach accepts this, does he intend to address their fears over the next nine days?  It seems obvious that Sinn Féin does not intend to do so.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach address the fears of the Unionist community and inform them that this is a &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; agreement?  Will he inform them that their fears of territorial annexation, which were frequently represented as the true intent of Articles 2 and 3, have been replaced with a much better statement in the new Articles? Does the Taoiseach see the need to address those fears which he has the stature and authority to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to address those fears through a series of articles and interviews in Northern Ireland newspapers.  In trying to convince and allay the concerns of Unionists and explain to them what is agreed, one of the difficulties is people's interpretation of issues.  That relates to something that is not new about issues related to Northern Ireland, people's fears and perceptions.  Those people are happier when it is explained to them what the institutional changes <Col N="49" /> will be and what is said about issues like decommissioning.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that people understand the advantages of economics, an enlarged Europe and better East-West relationships.  Deputies Quinn, Bruton and others will be aware from research done that the major fear is how we and they will share power and administration in the years ahead and we need to address that issue further.  I say here &mdash; and I will continue to say for the next week &mdash; that we are talking about a fair, balanced and comprehensive settlement.  It is balanced in a way that people from different communities can, in a peaceful and democratic way, work on a democratic agenda into the future.  There have been terrible murders and atrocities on all sides by so many and everyone is to blame.  There is no point in attributing blame to one sector or the other.  We must try to convince people that those who may have been associated with violence in the past want to play a constructive role in the future.  I hope that is what people want to do.  People who signed up to the Mitchell principles and this Agreement signed up to wanting to work on that basis.  As well as me speaking on this, perhaps all organisations concerned would do well to make their positions clear over the next week and to say we are at the end of the war, the violence and all the things that have happened.  Apart from what I will say over the next nine days, I will continue to urge people to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Taoiseach's reply, will he agree that the Unionists' supporters of a yes vote need at this stage a clear statement from the IRA that the war is over for good?  Will he also agree the IRA statement issued recently did not state that unequivocally, that it was deficient in that it did not acknowledge the referenda that are taking place here as a genuine and valid act of national self-determination and by failing to do so left an ideological platform upon which the IRA would have the option, if it suited it, to resume violence?  Will the Taoiseach agree the Unionist community is concerned at the possibility of Sinn Féin being able to take an each way bet in the sense of retaining an IRA position, which is not one of full acceptance that the war is over, while seeking at the same time all the privileges of normal democratic participation? Will he further agree there is a need for the removal of ambiguity on this subject by the republican movement and by the Governments here and in the United Kingdom in regard to the requirements for participation in executive responsibility in the new arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I spelt out the position here yesterday in reply to supplementary questions on the requirements for participation in an executive.  Those requirements are clear.  I refer people to what is in the document and what was given as clarification on what it means on the first day, the press conference on Good Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> Regarding people who are still not satisfied or overly impressed by various statements, I said here the morning after the last statement by the IRA &mdash; I will not comment directly on IRA statements &mdash; that it needs to be stated that the war is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The more that can be clarified the better.  Statements have been made in the last number of days by leading members of Sinn Féin and if they were firmed up it could be very useful. In reply to Deputy Quinn's point, that is what I am urging people should do.</P>
      <P>As we enter the last week of this campaign, there are other central issues.  One is that in a new relationship in the North under the institutional arrangements under strand one, what is being negotiated is that people will work together, people who have left violence behind and people who are not engaged in violence or those associated with it.  That includes punishment beatings and the other trappings of parliamentary activity. I want to be clear about that.  That was what was negotiated and what still stands.  Everybody should understand we are asking all the people to take a leap of faith to work the strand one arrangement and its administration.  I know from phone-in and answer programmes and analysis that people's main fear is not decommissioning or the prisoners issue, but dealing with those in an administration who they believe are, might still be or were associated with violence.  That is the central issue.</P>

      <P>Everything I can do to urge those to make their position clearer and that we, in this House, can collectively do, given that there is no division on this issue, we should do.  When those statements are made, the parties concerned must have a belief that there is a better day and a better way forward.  Everything that can be done to make that clearer, the better.  Over the next number of days I will do my part to try to urge people to make that clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of questions tabled on this issue and when the Taoiseach will be answering questions the next Question Time, these decisions will have been taken because the House will not be sitting next week.  The Taoiseach addressed the fears of the Unionist community in respect of what they would probably find most distasteful, but the view of the DUP and the UK Unionists, who are advocating a no campaign in Northern Ireland, is that the Union has been weakened from their perspective.  I appreciate it might be difficult for the leader of Fianna Fáil, as distinct from the Taoiseach, of what has been a bipartisan-tripartisan approach to the Northern issue to do this, but I ask the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Taoiseach to formally take the opportunity between now and 22 May to say unequivocally to the Unionist community in Northern Ireland that the Union with the United Kingdom is secure for such time as it wishes it to be secure and that it will only change with its consent.  That message is written into all the various agreements and the Taoiseach has said it on numerous other occasions.  I am not asking him to do or say anything he has not already signed up to and said. Will the Taoiseach agree that if that message were to come from his lips, as leader of the Fianna Fáil party and Taoiseach, it could perhaps redress some of the undoubted damage that was done by the displays of triumphalism we saw last Sunday and by the manner in which it was reported, particularly on the ITN news?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make three points.  We have talked about what was said last Sunday, but people should not forget the historic decision made then.  I know Members have not forgotten it.  It concerned people who had been engaged in violence for 30 years and those close to them politically, whatever about the arrangements.  We will not have a debate about them being two sides of the same coin because that would run on and on.  The reality is that historic decisions were made, decisions which people in this House and elsewhere did not believe would be made.  We have moved on in a major way from the path of violence.  Sinn Féin voted to accept by massive numbers, of which any of us in our organisations would have been proud, to accept an assembly, institutional change, the Northern Ireland State as it is and to participate in it in government. These were extraordinary decisions.  I regret the triumphalism and I do not want it to take from that historic day.  If all goes well, the history books will record the decisions and not the camera shots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The next decision is on Friday, 22 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  I have no difficulty saying that in the reformulation of Articles 2 and 3, there is a clear recognition &mdash; accepted by all the parties, and by the UUP after considerable debate &mdash; that we have moved as far as the parties wanted in terms of recognising that any decisions which would alter the configuration of the arrangements could be taken only with consent, the majority being of Unionist and loyalist persuasion.  I wanted to make that point unambiguous.  Some people have held the same view for 30 years, Mr. Bob McCartney during his period in office and Mr. Ian Paisley who is on record as saying this is the major problem and by voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; if he won, he would ensure we would not make these changes.  I am not sure of the logic behind this, but he would not understand the logic behind my arguments.  He is putting forward an illogical argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> We will not speak here on this issue again before the referenda.  As regards this Agreement, the strands and the issues of equality, prisoners and so on, the primary purpose of the efforts by successive Governments and the huge commitment by parties, North and South, British Governments and the Americans has been to try to get a somewhat complex arrangement to bring peace to this island.  Surely, people should ask whether voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for this Agreement will do more to bring peace, harmony and life without violence.  The answer to that question after any fair assessment must be &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with the Taoiseach that the great merit of this Agreement is that it writes the principle of consent into the Constitution, which has been accepted by Sinn Féin in its vote for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum here.  That is the historic change which gives great security to Unionists who are worried about whether to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  They should take note of what the Taoiseach said and of what we are united in saying on that.  Does the Taoiseach agree that if people in Northern Ireland vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the Agreement, they are also voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; to writing into our Constitution the principle of consent and, from a Unionist perspective, undermining their position?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the major difficulty with the republican movement is that for some purposes Sinn Féin says it can speak authoritatively for the movement as a whole while at other times, it says it has nothing to do with the IRA?  It has a capacity to speak in different capacities at different times when it suits it.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the united republican movement, Sinn Féin and the IRA, must both agree the war is over for good and must say so? Does he agree that historically, the decommissioning issue only became a problem because the republican movement refused to say its ceasefire was permanent and that it was the lack of such a statement that led to this totally unproductive debate about decommissioning?  Does he also agree that if the republican movement said in a united way that the war was over that in itself would defuse the decommissioning issue and move it from the plain of being a political question to being a simple technical issue.</P>

      <P>I have made my views clear on the statement saying the war is over because it is extremely important.  Perhaps it does not matter too much which groups says it, if the war is over. The leadership of the republican movement, whoever or wherever they are, should say it because it would be of great benefit.  It would be nice if each group said it but it would be a help if it could be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decommissioning is not as great an argument with people in the North as people would argue.  People want to hear a clear statement that people will take this process seriously, that they will follow through on what is in the <Col N="53" /> Agreement on decommissioning, that they will co-operate with the structures in place for the decommissioning body and that when they debate and organise how to deal with matters, they will not work against the decommissioning committee which has a clear mandate on what it wants to achieve.  It is important people make it clear they will follow this process.  By signing the Agreement, I believe they have done so. There are people in the Unionist community who would like it spelled out and if it would be helpful, it should be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have spoken to people outside the House on this matter.  Because it is written in this form, nobody can argue that it means anything other than what it states.  I clarified what it said last Friday week and nobody at the talks disagreed with that assessment.  If people agree to that assessment, we will not have to engage in endless debate about an issue with which it is possible to deal and move forward.</P>
      <P>As Deputy John Bruton, Deputy Quinn and others have said, we have moved constitutionally in this debate, which is difficult for some people in this State.  People have fears and reservations about it and have asked me at question and answer sessions in recent weeks about the events which occurred in the early weeks of this year when paramilitaries of loyalist persuasion seemed to break away from their political parties.  People in the Republic will go to the polls and I hope they will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in overwhelming numbers on the basis of their contribution, which is a major one to this Agreement.  People want to see others opting for a similar fate.  It will put matters back years if people vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the belief that it in some way protects something.  I have not heard a good argument put forward by campaigners for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the North on how the framework devised, which dates back to 1991, and the three strand approach do not address concerns about the Assembly, institutional arrangements, and North-South bodies, which will have a relationship with the Assembly that will develop in time along with executive powers and the implementation bodies and which will be based on trust and co-operation, the East-West relationship, which will grow and prosper in the future and the intergovernmental relationships.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, it was ironic to hear the leader of the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign, the Rev. Ian Paisley, say that people from the United Kingdom should not interfere in the campaign in Northern Ireland.  This seems to be a change from what he has said all his life.  We tried to address the issues which concerned Unionists, Nationalists, loyalists and republicans in this arrangement.  I join others in the Oireachtas in commending the Agreement in the strongest possible terms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>There were no additional costs, above routine administrative costs to my Department, in preparing the report of the interdepartmental committee on the protection of classified information. The interdepartmental committee with a mandate to develop detailed work practices and procedures for the protection of classified information is in the process of being established.  A principal officer in my Department has been nominated to chair the committee and the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence are being asked to nominate representatives.  This committee will draw up a model of best practice for the handling, circulation and storage of highly sensitive or top secret material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection of sensitive information is a matter of the highest priority within my Department.  The new classification of &ldquo;top secret&rdquo; was recommended by the interdepartmental committee on the protection of classified official information.  I understand that the Minister for Finance will issue a circular to Departments in the <Col N="55" /> near future outlining the material to which, and the procedures under which, it should be applied.</P>

      <P>The Government has not yet finalised its position on that.  There will have to be amendments to and reconsideration of that Act.

Will the Taoiseach agree there should be a clear guideline on release to the public of correspondence between Heads of Government? Is he aware correspondence between Deputy Albert Reynolds as Taoiseach and Mr. John Major as Prime Minister appeared <i>in extenso</i> in a book published recently?  Will the Taoiseach inquire how the correspondence between Deputy Reynolds and Mr. Major came into the hands of the authors of the book, O'Malley and McKittrick?</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that one of the recommendations of the review group is that information should be classified as top secret if it puts at risk the international relations of the State?  Will the Taoiseach agree confidential correspondence, including replies in this case, between the Taoiseach of the day, whoever he or she is, and the Prime Minister of another country should not be put into the public domain?  Bearing in mind that a serious investigation was <Col N="56" /> launched during the presidential election into other leaks, will the Taoiseach ensure a similar attitude is adopted in this matter?</P>

      <P>Discussions are continuing with interested parties on the question of obtaining contributions from the corporate sector towards the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.  I previously indicated that these discussions would be brought to conclusion as soon as detailed arrangements for the operation of the fund had been finalised.  The guidelines for the operation of the fund in the task force areas were published yesterday.  They set out in general terms the objectives of the fund in the task force areas; the process by which integrated plans for each area will be developed and assessed; and the broad criteria that will be applied in assessing the plans.</P>
      <P>The guidelines provide for funding under five broad headings: the enhancement and integration of existing facilities and services for young people in the target areas; the development of new viable facilities and amenities, including sport and recreational facilities, in these areas where a gap has been identified; the development of strategies to attract &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; young people into the facilities; the development of additional youth services for the target group; and the provision of support to voluntary and community groups and organisations working with &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; young people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An assessment committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, with representatives drawn from relevant Government Departments and agencies and the National Drugs Strategy Team, whose representation will include a voluntary-community representative, will assess all plans on the basis of the criteria established.  It will make recommendations on funding to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.  The final decision to fund projects submitted will be taken by the Government on the recommendation of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs.</P>

    <P>In broad terms, the plans will be assessed on the viability and sustainability of the individual <Col N="58" /> projects within the plan; the level to which they are integrated with other services and facilities; the extent to which they are additional and complementary with regard to existing facilities and services; and the extent to which they maximise the use of resources.</P>
    <P>I have written to the task force chairpersons asking them to convene the first meeting of the development groups, comprising representatives from the local drug task forces, the relevant local authority and VEC, which will be responsible for developing integrated plans for their areas.  Now that the guidelines for the operation of the fund in the task force areas have been agreed, I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on securing corporate involvement in the fund in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the independent management board for product development and is being conducted in full compliance with the EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC concerning the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997 and in the Irish media on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within the deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997 invitation to tender documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline of 14 November.  The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was 5 p.m. on Monday, 2 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full tender submissions were received from five consortia and the Bord Fáilte led evaluation teams immediately commenced their assessment of these submissions.  I understand that at the <Col N="59" /> management board's meeting of 14 April 1998, the board considered these assessments and concluded that the tenders submitted were not such as to enable it to make a recommendation at that time.</P>
    <P>The process has now proceeded to the negotiated procedure stage provided for in Article 7 of the directive, to be conducted by an independent team of technical experts.  The intention was that these experts will report to the board and provide it with the necessary technical advice to make a recommendation.  As the House will be aware, one of the tenderers has sought a judicial review of the decision to go to negotiated procedure and as this is now <i>sub judice</i> I cannot comment further on this aspect.</P>
    <P>As to procedures, the tender process is being organised by Bord Fáilte and the independent management board.  Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will be required in respect of any final selection.  The final date for taking account of expenditure for projects assisted under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 is 31 December 2000, as defined by Article 5 of Commission Decision C(94) 1972 of 29 July 1994, subject to paragraph 4.6.7 of the Community Support Framework 1994-1999 which states:</P>
    <P>.at the request of the Member State, duly made before expiry of time limits and supported by information establishing the justification for such a change, the Commission services may extend the time limits by not more than one year.  If the extension requested is for more than one year a formal Commission decision is required.  No expenditure incurred after the end date, as extended where appropriate, may be taken into consideration for the grant of assistance from the Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>This venture has the potential to become an expensive farce for the taxpayers.  The term &ldquo;judicial review&rdquo; sets alarm bells ringing. The Bord Fáilte management board for product development rejected the recommendation of the 14 member evaluation team and the matter was sent to a third body for consideration.  Did the Minister meet any of these groups or take any initiative to overcome this problem?  Different groups are threatening legal action.  The Minister instigated this by scrapping his predecessor's initiative which had almost come to a positive conclusion with the Commission.  Does the Minister feel he has a responsibility to show some leadership in attempting to avoid what could become an expensive legal farce with the potential loss of £25 million of EU funds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that I scrapped the last competition.  However, the competition was off the rails.  The EU would have upheld the <Col N="60" /> objection and the matter would have been finished.  I did not meet any of the groups concerned because it is an independent assessment process and I cannot meet any of them.</P>
      <P>I agree that it is becoming a legal farce.  This was never going to be a case in which the opponents shook hands, swapped jerseys and wished each other well after the match, so to speak.  There is always the potential for litigation in such processes.  There appear to be many interests with plenty of money who can hire barristers as we might buy toys for our children.  If there is enough ability to buy legal advice one can get the advice one desires.  I have not interfered in this process in any way.  I understand from the grapevine that there are six different legal opinions on this process.  It goes to show that one can get the legal advice one requires.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right that there is a serious danger of losing the conference centre.  There are fundamental questions that must be answered and which the report of the project management board has indicated to me.  They must have answers.  All those involved must meet the criteria.  That will not be done through PR or media hype.  The EU is the banker and has the final say. All the contenders must meet the objective criteria.</P>
      <P>However, at this point we are in the courts.  A conference centre could be a major asset to the economy.  We are the only major city in Europe which does not have a conference centre, yet we are in the courts.  I can do nothing about that.  If the conference centre is lost because we are unable to meet the objective criteria then so be it, but let us not lose it in the courts.</P>

      <P>I remind the Minister that it is not the Taj Mahal that is in question, just a conference centre.  The Minister set up the procedure and he is responsible politically for seeing it through.  He has been in Government for almost 12 months and he admits it is a legal farce.  He is responsible and it is incomprehensible that he has not met the management board for product development or the evaluation team.  He tells us he hears what is happening on the grapevine.  Will he meet the groups to try to reach an acceptable conclusion?  He must take the initiative and not let the matter descend into a legal wrangle in the courts whereby the EU funds will be lost.</P>

      <P>If I had met any of the groups concerned the conference centre would have been lost long since.  The Deputy is aware that the criteria state that an independent board, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, is responsible for the project.  The Minister is outside that. Although the Deputy is aware of those matters he is making political points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a report from the product management board which indicates that there are fundamental questions to be answered because they are matters which will have to be accounted for to the EU.  We have set up a negotiated procedure, <Col N="61" /> for which Bord Fáilte is responsible, and I do not understand why any of the interests are afraid to avail of it to allow the matter to proceed. It is in line with the directive.  Why are they afraid to meet and negotiate so that the conference centre will not be lost?  Instead the matter has been taken to court.  I understand the courts are closing on 29 May until 16 June, and I have to make a decision by 31 June.  Let the parties come to the negotiating procedure instead of risking losing this, not on the playing field, but in court.</P>

We grasped the nettle in relation to Luas.  There is money available for the conference centre.  We could lose the money relating to Luas, but perhaps we can redirect that.

      <P>I have not yet received the report of the Murphy Inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming.  An interim injunction has been obtained, the effect of which is preventing Dr Murphy temporarily from finalising his report.  Dr. Murphy is seeking to have the injunction set aside as soon as possible and must await the outcome of these proceedings before he can finalise his report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> In relation to the publication of the report, I reiterate what I have already stated in the House that, when I have received Dr. Murphy's final report and given it initial consideration, I intend to make its findings public.  However, a decision on publication of the full contents of his report cannot be made until it is received and all the implications of publication have been considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On 24 March, in response to a Dáil question raised by me, the Minister told us that the report would be available by the end of that month.  It is now 13 May and we still do not have the report.  The Minister has written confirming that he will publish the report but has not decided whether it will be published in full.  If the report of the inquiry is not published in full it will be meaningless to the victims of the alleged abuse. In view of the long delays, will the Minister now lift the sanctions against our top athletes in the Irish Amateur Swimming Association, who are the only people currently penalised?  These athletes are the innocent victims of the Minister's hamfisted sanctions.  They are preparing for world class events and facing an uncertain future going into the summer months.</P>

      <P>The answer to the latter part of the Deputy's question is no. The matter is dealt with in Question No. 17.</P>
      <P>The Murphy report was to have been published at the end of March.  The Deputy will recall that at that time more people wanted to come forward to give evidence.  The Deputy will agree that as many people as possible should be included in the report.  There are now from 1,300 to 1,400 in this report, and Dr. Murphy has been working diligently to get it published.  However, last Friday he was issued with an injunction to prevent him from completing the report and, as I was named as a co-respondent in the case, I cannot publish it either.  When the report comes forward for publication I intend to publish as much of it as possible, taking into account its sensitivity, the sensitivities of the victims and the people involved.  I intend to ensure that the report is seen by the victims, the IASA and the relevant people concerned.  Taking all that into consideration, the report will be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not have made promises he could not keep or given commitments he could not fulfil.  What timescale does the Minister now envisage for dealing with the legal injunction?  Is the legal injunction against the completion of the report or against its publication? Finally I plead with the Minister not to penalise our athletes.  They are the only people penalised by hamfisted sanctions against an association which came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism and Sport and Recreation and set out in detail what action they were taking to deal with the issue.  I ask the Minister to lift those sanctions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The injunction is against the completion of the report.  The report is practically complete but an injunction was issued at a late stage and, therefore, there is nothing I can do to expedite it.  The witnesses coming forward were dealt with long ago and it was a matter of tightening up the report and of Dr. Murphy liaising with the people involved to ensure that the report was complete and had no flaws.  I can do nothing, given the injunction.  I am as anxious as the Deputy to see the report, but the injunction is against completion of the report and against giving it to me to publish.  That in itself signals the type of report Dr. Murphy has undertaken.  We are contesting the injunction.  The case is for hearing next Monday but we might even have it contested before that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered at the outset that the approach being taken by the Minister in relation to this inquiry was fatally flawed because of the terms of reference.

The judge ruled that the organisation had grounds for having the case reviewed.  Therefore, the case is up for review and the date set was the earliest possible date, namely, the following Monday.  That is how the court system works.  Regarding the publication of the report, I have already informed the Deputy that it is my intention to publish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, funding for all sports is channelled through the relevant national governing body to ensure proper focus, strategic planning and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> The Irish Amateur Swimming Association is the recognised national governing body for the sport of swimming and it is the affiliated body to the international federation, FINA, which governs and regulates international competition in swimming.</P>
    <P>The allegations made concerning procedures used in handling cases of child sexual abuse by the IASA are of such a serious nature that I consider any findings relating to them arising from the Murphy inquiry would need to be fully addressed by the association before the Government could have complete confidence in their suitability to act as a vehicle for funding for swimming.  I am sure the Deputy shares my view that any doubts raised by the members of a body about its competence to provide a safe environment for younger members is a serious matter. It would be remiss of me to do anything that could be construed as facilitating the continuation of what is alleged to be a very unsatisfactory situation while such doubts remain.</P>
    <P>As I stated before, the question of funding for the IASA will be considered by me on receipt of Dr. Murphy's report and after the association has presented its proposals for confronting any issues arising from the report, including, in particular, matters relating to a safe environment for its members.  However, I indicated to the association my commitment that as soon as I had a chance to give initial consideration to Dr. Murphy's findings, I would meet it to discuss the immediate steps that might be taken to facilitate early consideration of restoring Government funding.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree, bearing in mind what he described as a political quagmire, months will pass before the report is presented to the Government, then to the swimming body and a response is produced?  At the end of the day athletes are suffering and the future of the association is at issue.  It had five employees at the end of January and has only two now who are overworked.  There is also a grave doubt over participation in international competition.  Will the Minister produce a formula whereby interim funding can be provided to allow our many swimmers to take part in international competition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go back on the decision I made as I am determined to withhold funding from the IASA.  If I funded the IASA, and its elite swimmers, the victims would say the situation persists that persisted previously but just because a certain amount of time has elapsed the Minister continues to fund them.  I am determined not to provide any funding until I receive the Murphy report and I am satisfied all young people involved with the association are in a safe environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy refers to those involved.  Any association is made up of its members and it is up to them to ensure they put their house in order. The Deputy argued in the House a few months ago and agreed that until I received the report I <Col N="65" /> would not have a governing body for swimming in which I could have confidence.  I am not prepared to reintroduce funding for the reasons I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is serious in his commitment to swimmers, a formula can be found and sufficient safeguards put in place to facilitate them.  He is penalising the athletes.  If he is so disposed, it is not beyond his ability or that of his officials to come up with a framework through which funding can be provided.  This year's international athletes, who are totally innocent, should not be penalised, irrespective of others who may have to face guilt in this regard.</P>

      <P>Last week I announced a carding system for high performance athletes and it is probably the best in Europe.  It provides for up to £24,000 in grants depending on one's rank in the world.  That amount is only surpassed in the UK where £25,000 may be provided, but it is practically impossible to meet all the criteria to get that money.  Germany has provision for £22,000 while New Zealand and Australia provide up to £10,000 and £15,000 respectively.  Grants in Ireland are issued through the national governing body, the IASA.  It currently does not meet the degree of confidence necessary as a result of what happened in the past and I am not prepared to go back.  However, once the Murphy report is presented to me and I am satisfied it meets the criteria&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Shea that it could take months; it will probably take a few weeks if the injunction goes ahead.  However, upon publication of the report I hope to be in a position to provide funding to the IASA.  As an alternative in the interim, given that there will be no Exchequer funding, the association should seek funding through sponsorship or private support.  I am determined to continue with the line I have pursued in the interest of swimming as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed by the Minister's remarks.  On 24 March I raised this issue and the Minister used the same line.  It appears from his earlier comments that the report could be delayed for a considerable time.  As Hardy said to Laurel &ldquo;That's another fine mess you got us into.&rdquo; The Minister has swimmers in a fine mess. I recently heard a top swimmer on a radio programme lamenting that she had an uncertain future because of the lack of funding.  The innocent victims, our top swimmers, could be funded directly by the Irish sports council under the system to be implemented by the Minister, which I announced during my term in office.  Under that system the Irish Sports Council could identify the athletes who need support and fund them directly.  With goodwill, imagination and flexibility <Col N="66" /> on the part of the Minister this could be easily done.</P>
      <P>Everyone agrees there should be standards in organisations but we should not penalise innocent victims who are the athletes representing the country abroad and preparing for international competition.  Will the Minister consider allowing the Irish sports council, which will soon be established as a statutory body, to fund athletes until such time as he and the IASA sort themselves out?</P>

How does the Minister square this with the fact that their parent body is not in receipt of funding?  The Minister is disingenuous when he suggests that sponsorship could be forthcoming from the private sector against the background of the State not providing funding for the association.

In this regard, like my predecessors, I do not restrict myself to the concept of formal meetings as I believe, with the board, it is what we do together, rather than the format of how we meet, that is important.</P>

      <P>It is astounding that in 12 months the Minister has formally met the board on only two occasions at a time when morale in Bord Fáilte is at an absolute low and there have been three resignations from the board.  Does he consider there is a crisis in Bord Fáilte as we approach this year's tourism season and they are holding workshops in preparation for next year? Even though morale is low and the chief executive and two senior management personnel have resigned, the Minister has met the board only <Col N="68" /> twice since taking office.

A total of 950 million people, 1,000 journalists and 500 radio stations will focus on Ireland on 12 July this year.  Let us show them something different.  I hope the GRA will immediately withdraw its threat of action on that day because it is not in the national interest.

As he brought up the Tour de France, what discussions did he have with the board about the GRA's threat to disrupt the tour?  What discussions did he have with the Minister for Defence on the plans to be put in place in the event of a Garda strike going ahead?</P>
      <P>Is it correct that the director general of Bord Fáilte resigned, got his due entitlements but is on a three year consultancy earning £40,000 per annum?  Did the Minister meet the board to discuss the report on this matter in a Sunday newspaper?</P>

      <P>I have not met the Ministers for Defence or Justice, Equality, and Law Reform in regard to the GRA action plan for the Tour de France.  The matter has been discussed and we are extremely concerned about it.  I appeal to the GRA, in the national interest, to note the date involved and refrain from action so that the world can see this country in a different light on 12 July this year.  I appeal to it to say the Tour de France will not be affected.</P>
      <P>I met members of Bord Fáilte on many occasions in the context of the various committees with which they are involved.  The issue concerning the director general of Bord Fáilte is an internal matter for board.  It does not involve me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>At future meetings with Board Fáilte will the Minister consider the question of upgrading approved self-catering accommodation in Border counties?  There has been a fall-off in business in this area because of the troubles in</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland.  As a Minister from Donegal, will he consider providing a grant for self-catering accommodation in Border counties, in particular, because of the potentially large number of tourists who will visit those counties this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with the Deputy on that matter.  In terms of tourism, Border counties in the South have suffered equally, if not more, than those in the North.  I have always maintained that the British Government responded to Northern businesses and re-established them right away, sometimes on an even better basis, so that they tended to flourish, whereas along the Border in the South we had ghost towns, not alone in the hotel and bed and breakfast sector but in other industries.</P>
      <P>I am looking at this matter but it is difficult to arrange positive discrimination for a particular area.  Perhaps we should examine how we could use INTERREG and the peace and reconciliation fund along the Border for this purpose.  I agree there is a need to upgrade those facilities. We have marvellous people, scenery, lakes and fishing but when CNN and other channels showed burning buses on their screens no one wanted to come near us.  The need to help tourism and bed and breakfast providers along the Border is one reason we should try to ensure an overwhelming &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote because no one will benefit more from peace and reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy Allen I have already prepared the plans for the years 2000 to 2006 in my Department.  I am in discussions with industry representatives and have asked them to bring forward their plans.  We will then try to ensure common ground because the success of the tourism industry has been built on the co-operation of the Department, Bord Fáilte, the unions and the private sector.  It is a partnership between those <Col N="70" /> four areas and we intend to keep it that way, working together on each other's ideas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to Bord Fáilte my plans in different areas.  The Deputy mentioned people resigning from Bord Fáilte but those who did were moving on to better jobs. They were well trained in Bord Fáilte and were offered lucrative positions elsewhere.  We will have to address this issue in the semi-State sector because we will not be able to keep these people. We are losing to the private sector the people I call the Celtic tiger's most vivacious cubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister's remarks on the Border counties.  In light of the British Government's announcement this week that £350 million would be provided for Northern Ireland, I am relieved that money is to be put into INTERREG because that fund is depleted at present.  Can the Minister assure this House that funding will be made available for bed and breakfast accommodation, which is crucially important?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 28, 33, 35 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>As this is a matter which will impact mainly on access transport operators and Aer Rianta it is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Government is using every opportunity to raise this issue at political level in appropriate EU fora and to suggest the need for further study by the European Commission of the implications of the abolition of intra-EU duty free.  Given concerns about the possible impact of the proposed measure on the development of the tourism industry generally the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, raised the issue at the EU Tourism Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on 26 November last year.  On numerous occasions the Taoiseach and a number of my ministerial colleagues have also been active in highlighting the importance of this matter.  I understand the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will raise the matter at the next ECOFIN meeting on 19 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The abolition of duty free sales will mean higher air and ferry fares into Ireland and will result in losses of £30 million to the Irish airlines, £9 million to Irish ferry operators, and £25 million to Aer Rianta.  Costs will increase also.  I am amazed the Minister has not made a personal initiative.  The Minister of State raised the matter at a Council meeting last year but in view of the crisis now upon us, with its severe negative potential for tourism, I would have thought the Minister would have been more active with his European colleagues on this issue.  I accept that the Minister for Finance will raise it on 19 May at an ECOFIN meeting but since it impacts directly on this Minister's area surely he should take a more vibrant involvement at European level.  Has he any plans to take a personal initiative?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The only meeting of Tourism Council of Ministers was attended by the Minister of State due to my inability to be there.  We have tried to raise it on every single occasion.  As I said, it is not directly a matter for myself but it is vitally important to the tourism industry.  I remind the Deputy that while his Government was in power it was not raised at a single Council meeting, nor at any summit.  It is ironic that the Deputy continues to bring up this question and to use it as a stick to beat us with, when his Government paid no attention to this while it was in power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that if duty free sales are abolished it will have a serious <Col N="72" /> impact on tourism infrastructure, in that the regional airports and sea carriers depend heavily on duty free income for their running costs?  Has his Department carried out a study of the effects on tourism in Ireland if duty free sales are abolished? At the forthcoming ECOFIN meeting will his colleague, the Minister for Finance, ask the Council and the Commission to carry out a study into the impact of this abolition throughout the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are serious implications for the tourism industry, including issues relating to access, the regional airports and employment.  One of the first studies was carried out by the EU and a more recent one was done by KPMG, which was presented at the end of March.  The Deputy may wish to examine that study, which lists numerous implications of the abolition of duty free and analyses the arguments for and against the move.  We have continued to raise this matter in Europe and have said we feel further studies are required.  The move was first agreed on the basis that there would be harmonisation of tax by this time but that has not happened.  On the basis of a lack of information, due to insufficient study, and the fact that there has not been a harmonisation of taxes, we believe this matter deserves further consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Duty free is essential, but if our worst fears are realised will the Minister consider the possibility of asking Aer Rianta to modify the structure of retail stores in airports because duty does not apply to much of the stock that is retailed, yet in terms of advertising it would appear that duty applies to all stock?  That is a misunderstanding on the part of the customer and Aer Rianta has been somewhat compliant in that regard.  From a tourism point of view, it would help matters if the Minister clearly identified the items to which duty applies in the retail stores.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As we are the only EU country without a land boundary with Europe, surely the Government could argue that an exception should be made in the case of Ireland.  In response to the cheap shot from the Minister, it was the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, who got us into this mess in 1991 so the Minister should not try to shift the responsibility to the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992, rather than banning duty free sales from January 1993, as part of the harmonisation of taxes and the Single Market, the campaign which was led by several countries, including the Taoiseach on behalf of this country, managed to get an extension until 1 January 2000, which was a considerable improvement on what was then being proposed.  That decision was taken as part of our joining the Single Market and on the basis that there would be harmonisation of taxes, which has not occurred.  Studies require to be carried out on those issues and that is the reason we are continuing the fight.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's point about Aer Rianta is a good one, but I am not the person to whom it should be directed.  I could raise the matter with the Minister for Public Enterprise but perhaps the Deputy would put down a question to her because it is relevant and deserves a better answer than I might give today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 112 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year I announced that I was initiating a comprehensive review by my Department of the operation of the sports capital programme. Before work began on the review, I arranged for an examination of all applications on hands at 11 February 1998 in the context of the 1998 round of grant allocations.  I also announced that no <Col N="74" /> further applications would be accepted by my Department under the existing sports capital programme after 11 February 1998.  Following this examination, the 1998 round of grant allocations, under the sports capital programme, was announced on 8 April 1998 when approximately £5 million was allocated to new projects.  All applicants, successful and unsuccessful, have now been notified of the outcome.</P>
    <P>All outstanding funding allocated under the programme, including funding allocated in the 1998 round, will be paid subject to the terms and conditions already attaching to the schemes being met.</P>
    <P>The review of the programme will be carried out over the next few months.  When the review is completed, which I expect to be towards the end of 1998, details of the new schemes will be widely publicised and it will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new schemes.  New applications will have to be made in all cases.</P>
    <P>The review of the sports capital programme is one of a number of measures I have asked my Department to take, in the context of delivering on the priorities set out in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, in relation to all the areas for which I have responsibility.  While I cannot pre-empt the outcome of the review, I assure the Deputy that one of the issues it will examine will be the way lottery funding can best be targeted at the needs of disadvantaged areas and voluntary groups in line with Government policy on recognising the value of sport and leisure in fostering a sense of community in even the most deprived areas.  The new criteria for qualification for funding under the revised sports capital schemes are likely, therefore, to have a strong focus on such needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the difficulties facing the Minister in view of the overwhelming demand for grants.  This time last year there were approximately 1,300 projects worth about £500 million, and grants applied for amounted to approximately £48 million.  The Minister announced in February that he would launch a new scheme later in the year.  Will the Minister fulfil commitments made by him and his party before the election that he would use a little imagination, as set out in the national plan for sport?  Will he attempt to supplement Exchequer funding with private investment by way of tax covenants, tax breaks or rates remission as we have seen in the urban renewal and rural schemes?  Does the Minister intend to offer incentives to the private sector to get involved in the development of facilities at national, regional and local level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, will deal with that specific issue.  We are pursuing that line with regard to offering incentives and bringing the private sector into line in co-operation with the public sector. For the Deputy's information, 1,423 applications <Col N="75" /> were made and we gave out 235 grants totalling £4.95 million.  The incentive in that document, with which I agree, is a good one which is being pursued by my colleague, Deputy Flood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will these incentives be incorporated in the next budget or Finance Bill?  Will it happen that quickly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been discussed by the Cabinet subcommittee on social inclusion which meets on a monthly basis to deal with that area.  I am prepared to listen to any suggestions the Deputy cares to bring forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider ringfencing a portion of lottery funding in the area in which sales are generated?  In the north west, approximately £50 million worth of sales is being generated by the lottery.  Of the £212 million allocated, not one pound went to Sligo despite the fact that four to five major applications were submitted.  The original concept of the lottery was to fund sport, and while we all welcome the opening of large centres throughout the country, even the smallest fund generates considerable wealth in remote areas.  If that were matched with community initiatives, it would quadruple any grant that is allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to clarify a point.  If an organisation was granted funding for a specific part of a development, which was completed by the time the funding was allocated, can money allocated before the closing date in February now be allocated to a further part of the same development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I forwarded to all Deputies a telephone number through which they can make inquiries.  My understanding is that if funding was received for one stage of a particular development one would be entitled to continued funding. Perhaps the Deputy would get in touch with my Department, or I can get in touch with him regarding that matter, rather than take up the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bringing forward a Sports Bill the objective of which will be to put sporting on a statutory basis.  I would remind Deputy Allen that, at my behest, the Taoiseach said yesterday the Bill would be published in approximately four weeks. That would be our aim but I think it may take about eight weeks.  When the Sports Bill is published those are issues I would be amenable to change.  I have listened to reports on work already done by Deputy Allen in the whole area <Col N="76" /> of sport.  There should be a broad interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>On the ring-fencing of national lottery funds to various counties, this is a matter which could be discussed but it is outside my remit.  When I looked at the allocations on a <i>per capita</i> basis I found that County Sligo, thanks to the Deputy's predecessors, was in the top six of all grant allocations since l988.  I was trying to level out the playing field a little better.</P>

      <P>The mid-term review of the URBAN Operational Programme is due to be completed by 3 June 1998.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental policy committee on local development was reconstituted under my chairmanship in October 1997.  It has a mandate in relation to the overall co-ordination of Government policy on local development.  All Departments, with the exceptions of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence, are represented on the committee as well as three agencies &mdash; Area Development Management Limited, Combat Poverty Agency and FÁS.  There have been five committee meetings to date.  The main themes of the committee's discussions to date have related to reviewing interdepartmental and agency co-ordination in relation to local development initiatives, developing a co-ordinated approach to meeting the needs of the most deprived urban areas, and considering the future of local development programmes post-1999.</P>
      <P>The committee has been mandated to oversee an integrated services project.  The project, which will operate in four pilot areas, seeks to develop new procedures to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities to the needs of committees with the greatest levels of disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee is also considering the future of local development programmes post-1999, especially in the context of proposals for the closer integration of local development and local government systems.  The committee has recently received presentations in this regard from area partnerships, Leader groups, county enterprise boards, local development liaison teams, the General Council of County Councils, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the <Col N="77" /> Donegal County Manager and the Dublin City Manager.  These presentations have primarily focused on three related issues: co-ordinated delivery of State services to disadvantaged areas, the shape and content of local development programmes post-1999 and the administrative context of these programmes post-1999.</P>
    <P>I report to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, Drugs and Local Development in relation to the work of the committee.</P>

      <P>What is causing the delay in distributing the funds under the URBAN programme? Will the Minister confirm figures I got at the Committee of Public Accounts last week to the effect that, although the decision was made in April l996 &mdash; £5 million to Ballymun-Finglas, £5 million to Tallaght-Clondalkin and £10 million to Cork northside &mdash; more than two years later only £0.7 million in Ballymun-Finglas, £0.5 million in Tallaght-Clondalkin and £0.2 million in Cork northside has been drawn down?  What is the reason for this bureaucracy and interminable consultations in areas of greatest need?  Is it not the case that the URBAN programme is supposed to target areas of greatest need?  The Minister is aware, as I am, of very meritorious projects in our constituency, yet these moneys are waiting to be dispensed.  Irrespective of the cause of the blockage the money cannot be distributed despite the existence of many meritorious projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying the drawdown of funds to these programmes has been slow.  Obviously we are concerned about that matter.  Progress in the early stage of the programme was slow.  This was caused to some extent by the need for considerable local consultation and many of the major projects involved going through the whole planning process and lodging planning applications, all of which causes delays.</P>
      <P>The report of the external evaluator on 3 June will help us identify areas that can be targeted in a more focused way to deal with the hold ups and may make recommendations as to how we can speed up the process on the drawdown of funds, which all of us are anxious should take place.  We can make progress.  I accept there has been a slowness in drawing down the funds.  The report on 3 June will be of considerable help in this regard.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister politically drive this programme?  I am aware that the bodies to which he has referred are participating in the decisions.  These interminable consultations must end sometime.  I ask him to personally drive this programme and to publish the mid-term review so that the evaluation can be debated.  Will he comment on, for example, the Cosán project in west Tallaght, with which he is familiar, and whether it might be eligible for funding under this programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be my intention to have the evaluation report published and made available to Members who have a keen interest in this programme.</P>
      <P>As I explained at a public meeting recently, the Cosán project, which the promoters propose to locate in the Jobstown area, fits in nicely with the Government's efforts to target social exclusion and disadvantage.  Therefore it would have my personal support.  I have indicated to the promoters that I am anxious to be of assistance and will seek to ensure, wherever possible, they will get resources, either through this programme or one or two other programmes with which the Deputy will be familiar, including the local drugs taskforce and the youth amenities and facilities fund.  The particular project could be assisted through any of those three programmes.  We will work together as a team in the area to ensure that happens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the hope and aspiration of most young people to own a home.  However, the hopes of many families, couples and individual have evaporated in recent months because of the trend in house prices arising from the combination of low interest rates and increased demand.  People are buying houses at inflated prices, which is imposing major pressures on them.  Every day one hears of young couples, married or unmarried, who have to work to afford the repayments.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report was commissioned approximately six or seven months ago.  When it was being compiled house prices in some areas increased by 20 per cent.  The imminence of the report provided the Government with an excuse to do nothing.  For example, a number of months ago my party made proposals regarding stamp duty which where ridiculed, yet the Government has now introduced similar proposals.</P>
      <P>Much attention has been focused on the private sector.  The pressure on individuals who are finding the cost of houses beyond their reach is becoming apparent in the local authority housing lists.  For example, the Cork Corporation housing list for the quarter ending 31 March showed an unacceptable increase in the number of people waiting for housing.  In a very short time the figure has increased from just under 2,000 to 2,800. Despite this, only 76 houses &mdash; ten new and 66 old &mdash; were allocated in three months.  At the same time, only 38 tenants got a transfer from one corporation property to another.</P>
      <P>If the position is similar in other local authorities we face a crisis.  Increased house prices has resulted in young people finding it impossible to buy their own homes.  They are now applying for local authority housing.  The Government's response will not address the pressures on the local authority housing lists.  For example, despite the waiting list of 2,800 in my city, the Government allocated £8.8 million this year of which £7.1 million will finance houses already under construction.  This leaves a balance of only £1.7 million for new starts this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This crisis is driving young people, often with young children, into either substandard accommodation or very expensive rented accommodation subsidised by the health boards.  This week and last I put questions on rent supplements and mortgage subsidies to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  In 1997 the health boards paid rent supplements of £75 million, an increase of approximately 18 per cent over 1996 when the figure was £64 million.  Doubtless the figure for this year has escalated even further. In addition, they paid mortgage interest supplements of £10.08 million in 1997.  This means the taxpayer is supplementing private rented accommodation by approximately £85 million per <Col N="80" /> annum.  The Southern Health Board paid £14.2 million in 1997 to subsidise accommodation for people who had to go into private rented accommodation.  At the same time, its only funding for house starts this year amounted to £1.7 million. These figures illustrate the need for a radical new approach by the Government to the provision of public housing.</P>
    <P>These initiatives by the Minster fall far short of what was expected.  In addition, he has used them to take care of a powerful lobby group.  The reduction in the capital gains tax to 20 per cent is disgraceful.  We must not entertain the possibility that the goal of home ownership is put beyond the reach of young people.  Everything possible must be done to deal with these issues through taxation and the provision of public housing at local authority level.</P>
    <P>The decision by the courts regarding the return of a deposit to a couple after a lengthy period is alarming.  There is an onus on the Law Society to tighten up the contracts offered to people when purchasing a house, including the standard contract approved by the society, with a view to safeguarding the rights of the purchaser.  We should not be reacting to court judgments but should legislate to protect people before recourse to the courts arises.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West):</i> What has gone on in recent years in the housing market throughout the country, particularly in the Dublin area, in terms of the massive increase in house prices, is nothing short of legalised racketeering.  I ask Members on the Government side why the Bacon study did not go into this aspect of the house pricing scam in more detail.  A large amount of money has been paid out on the study but we did not get any picture of the extent of racketeering in the housing market.  It should have been laid out, at a minimum giving examples in the main urban areas and a breakdown of the cost of the average semi-detached and detached home in terms of materials and labour, both administrative and physical, highlighting the extent of profiteering and exploitation.  I am at a loss to know why this was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It beggars belief that Deputies have put the problem down to supply and demand as if this explains the crisis.  It is not a question of supply and demand but of the decision of builders and developers to go for mass exploitation and profiteering, pricing young people out of the market. Unfortunately, we are carrying on a tradition as far as Dáil Éireann is concerned.  Traditionally, builders and developers have been protected by certain political parties and the politicians belonging to those parties.  That sector lavishly contributes to some of the right wing political parties in the State and, undoubtedly, individual politicians.  It is nauseating to see members of Fianna Fáil in particular shuffling in their places, defending out of the side of their mouths and putting in a word for some of the speculators and profiteers.  The register of interests of Members <Col N="81" /> of the Dáil and Seanad shows that a large component are property owners, including rented property.  This, undoubtedly, colours their view and their interest should be declared.</P>
    <P>For almost 12 months the Government has sat on its hands &mdash; its predecessor did likewise &mdash; while prices have gone out of the reach of ordinary people.  It is a crisis for first time buyers.  A worker on the average industrial wage &mdash; approximately £15,000 per annum &mdash; has no hope of qualifying for a loan for the average priced new house and the vast majority of second-hand houses that will come on the market.  The schemes which were designed to make homes available to the lower paid such as the shared ownership scheme are paralysed because there is no way that those who qualify can make the repayments in accordance with the standards laid down as administered by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Fingal County Council, of which I am a member, is in a position to purchase only one home under the shared ownership scheme.  It will be reduced to bringing 20 anxious applicants into a room and organising a lottery.  This is shameful. Unfortunately, the Government's proposals will do nothing to rectify the position.  They do not address the stark fact that prices are way out of reach.  We have a hapless Minister for Finance who is attempting to close the stable door after the horse called House Prices has bolted through the roof.  He has no proposals to repair the gaping hole.  Measures are required to make homes affordable for ordinary working people and to allow the schemes which were designed to help low to middle income earners to purchase their own homes to be effective once again.  I ask the Government to address these points specifically. I hope we will have more time to tease them out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to propose some measures which are influenced by the policies of democratic socialism and which would have the support of the vast majority of ordinary people, particularly those in need of homes.  The problem begins with the outrageous speculation in land.  This should be outlawed.  The rezoning of land from agricultural to residential sees its price rise by perhaps 1,000 per cent overnight to the benefit of the landowner and the speculator.  The idea that the huge increase in house prices is due to the shortage of zoned land is a cover for speculation.  In many councils there is adequate serviced land available for years ahead.  Therefore, that argument does not stand up.</P>
    <P>All land needed for building, particularly in urban areas, should be taken in charge by a public agency at use value and released to builders as needed on the basis that the price of the end product would be strictly controlled.  Speculation in building land, therefore, would not be a factor in massively putting up house prices, which should be strictly controlled.  The price is made up of the cost of the land, building materials and labour, both physical and administrative.  Profiteering <Col N="82" /> which puts tens of thousands of pounds on the cost of these inputs should be outlawed.</P>
    <P>There is major exploitation in the private rental sector.  This is not addressed in the Bill.  Rack-renting has returned.  We thought we had got rid of the landlords but, unfortunately, they are back with a vengeance.  In modest suburbs such as the one in which I live a modest house commands £500 or £600 per month from the unfortunate person who is obliged to rent.  Extortionate rents are being demanded for the most shabby bedsits.  It is scandalous that successive Governments have encouraged this position through section 23 developments.  The tax on what are essentially rack rents could have been waived by various Governments.  Instead of justice for tenants and controlled rents and standards there is flouting of whatever modest controls exist.  I understand that the legislation relating to registration is complied with by only 25 per cent of landlords.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing is in crisis.  The situation would be assisted if an emergency programme of funding and house construction was established.  This would provide within two or three years homes for every family and individual suffering on the housing list.  It would be a considerable improvement.  This measure is required and the Government must state whether it has any proposals in that regard.  The measures in the Bill may slow the rate of increase but they will not give ordinary people the possibility of owning their homes or renting accommodation at reasonable rents with security of tenure.</P>

      <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Government in commissioning and implementing the Bacon report.  In recent years house prices have escalated beyond affordable rates for people on average industrial wages.  This has been coupled with a shortage of development land, low interest rates and a booming economy. It has put huge pressure on people who wish to purchase their first house.  This is why the Government's initiative is timely and welcome.  It was necessary to commission a report to establish the best way to control escalating house prices. The Bill will enact the proposals of the Bacon report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is part of an overall package.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has taken an initiative regarding the funding of infrastructure.  Extra allocations will be made to local authorities for sewerage and water schemes to allow more land to be serviced and rezoned for development.  Unfortunately, in recent years planners, county managers and those with executive powers in local authorities have not played their part in ensuring that enough land was rezoned for reasonable density housing to <Col N="83" /> keep prices down.  This happened in many parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelleher</NameTxt>
      <P>On the periphery of the city where there are services, land has not yet been rezoned for high density housing.  This is putting huge pressure on the market in Cork.  In Dublin, irrespective of Deputy Higgins's comments, if private individuals own land, they have a right, which is enshrined in the Constitution, to sell it whenever and for as much as they wish.  Incentives must be introduced to encourage them to sell the land to developers and builders to ensure affordable housing is available.  I am confident the proposals in the Bill, in addition to the announcements of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will stabilise the escalating price of houses and ensure that people on low and middle incomes have an opportunity to purchase their first houses.</P>
      <P>County development plans are always contentious but planners and county managers have a moral obligation to ensure that young people and first time buyers can get into the housing market and purchase a decent house.  This is the stumbling block at present.  Regardless of the price of a house, unless one is trading up, it is impossible for people to get into the market.  Another factor is the current high cost of rent.  People cannot afford to save money for a deposit or take out an 80 per cent mortgage.</P>
      <P>The banks also have a role to play.  I am concerned because they appear to be dishing out money.  Up to 95 per cent of the value of a house is readily available from banks if one shops around.  This is also forcing up the price of housing.  The banks have a duty and moral obligation to put in place a mechanism to ensure money is not so freely handed out because that adds momentum to house prices.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been broadly welcomed and I support the provisions announced by the Government regarding the implementation of the Bacon report.  If action had not been taken there would have been problems in the near future regarding the national pay agreement.  Inflationary pressures could have crept into the economy which would also have created difficulties in terms of reaching a new pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these measures had not been introduced huge pressure would have been placed on public <Col N="84" /> housing.  This area must be examined because as house prices have increased, people have fallen back on public housing lists.  Irrespective of how much money was allocated to local authorities, ultimately it would not have been possible to build the number of houses needed to accommodate everybody.  The Bill is a proactive measure to ensure that house prices stabilise and people will have the opportunity to purchase their first homes.</P>
    <P>Many people lobbied the Government with regard to rental income.  The position has been good for those involved in letting houses for the past number of years.  As other Deputies said, Government policies and various tax incentives in the past encouraged this type of development. However, they were implemented to stimulate the building trade which was at a low ebb in the early 1990s and the economy in general.  It was also considered at the time that they would provide affordable housing and rented accommodation for young people.  However, the speculators again moved in and purchased large areas of designated land.  They are now letting properties and reaping the dividends.  This is the reason for the rental income aspects of the Bill.  I am confident they will have a major impact on the affordability of rent.</P>
    <P>Last year the health boards paid out approximately £90 million in rent and mortgage subsidies.  A better system must be put in place because £90 million would build many houses.  This matter must be examined to ensure the problems encountered by people on low incomes are addressed. Rent and mortgage subsidies benefit people who have five or six houses and the person who is renting the property will never get out of that trap.  The public housing policy must be broadened.  The money currently spent on rent and mortgage subsidies must be diverted towards the building of more public housing.</P>
    <P>In 1845 the population was eight million.  It is now four million and it defies belief that people in certain parts of rural Ireland still cannot get planning permission.  Planners, county managers and county councillors must assess this situation because villages and towns are being denuded of their people.  I urge county managers, county councillors and planning officials to take escalating house prices into account.  It is very difficult for people in rural Ireland to get sites to build on in their own areas, and this is putting pressure on schools, shops and the entire community structure.</P>
    <P>We will be judged on the effectiveness of this measure, which is an attempt by the Government to influence the market.  It is positive and proactive and I hope it works.  It has been welcomed by most people although it will have to be monitored closely.  If it does not have the desired effect, the situation will have to be assessed again, but the problem has been acknowledged.  An attempt has been made to implement the Bacon report proposals, though this Bill is only part of an overall package.  I hope that over coming years <Col N="85" /> those currently debarred from the housing market will be able to enter the market&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Every Irish person wants to own his own home; we have the highest rate of home ownership in the EU and we have always nurtured home ownership.  It has always been Fianna Fáil policy to assist first time buyers in purchasing their homes.  We will continue to do so and I am confident that these measures, along with the proposals of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will assist people in making their first house purchase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kelleher.  There was a need to take action because house prices were spiralling out of control.  My daughter is getting married and is trying to buy a house.  House prices in my town range from approximately £75,000 to £120,000.  It struck me that young people are in a straitjacket. Accordingly I welcome this Bill and the adoption, in principle, of the recommendations of the Bacon report.</P>
      <P>If one compares house prices today with those of five to ten years ago, the effect of our economic growth is clear.  There was a time when tax incentives were introduced to generate house purchases and to ensure there were enough apartments and houses available to rent.  However, time moves on and one must be concerned about inflationary pressures that are part of high house prices.  The Government is addressing this.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to people in the property business, including one man who owns 35 houses.</P>
      <P>His attitude is that he had a great time and the gala is over, but that he is no longer interested in purchasing houses for rental purposes.  This measure should stop the exceptional demand from investors, who should now get out of the market, albeit after a good innings.  Large groups of investors buying blocks of apartments and houses meant there would be inflationary pressure on rents.  Deputy Kelleher is right.  The cost of rent supplement was £6 million in 1989; it is £96 million in 1998.  How long can we pay such sums in rent supplement? Rents must be reduced.</P>
      <P>This Bill gives the lie to the idea of overzoning. What a field day the press and the Left had in opposing rezoning.  We were told there was no need for rezoning, but now everybody accepts that not enough land has been zoned.  We heard about brown paper bags, but the people now seen to have had foresight were councillors who read a demand for land and answered it, often against the wishes of their managers and planners.  They saw a need for extra land and rezoned extra land. Now there is not enough land and we will have to examine the situation again.</P>

      <P>This initiative means that every local authority will have to look at land that has not been zoned.  The Government has moved on the tax concessions, which means that £1 million has been released to fund schemes to ensure that proper sewerage and water facilities will be available to unserviced sites.</P>
      <P>It follows that if one makes the market less attractive to the large scale investor and opens up more land, there will be more houses available to the first time house purchaser.  That is the kernel of what we are trying to achieve.  I told the Minister for Finance that it was unfair to ask people who had land in their family for generations to sell that land for housing and to pay 40 per cent tax on a family holding.  I thought that quite unfair, and many of those landowners told me that under no circumstances were they prepared to sell the land and to pay that tax.  However, the 20 per cent tax rate and four year clause means that reality has struck them.  That tax is not a major contribution given the increased value of their land and many will now make land available.</P>
      <P>I welcome much of the package.  However, we speak of decentralisation and rural areas being depopulated.  There are villages in my constituency such as Ovens, Ballinora, Waterfall, Bally-garvan, Ballinhassing, Riverstick and Passage West that are within ten miles of Cork city.  A new house has not been built in some of these areas in ten years.  A rural resettlement programme was announced for the Shannon region. The Minister should carefully examine peripheral towns in regard to the provision of clusters of housing as that would be very worthwhile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the indication by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government today that under the shared ownership scheme he will increase up to £50,000 the amount that can be lent and he will decrease the percentage of rent that must be paid.  If we want to greatly reduce the numbers on the housing list, the shared ownership scheme is an option that is affordable for many families. If we accept the majority of our people want to <Col N="87" /> own their homes, that mechanism would be very attractive to them.  The ideal of family-owned houses is one we should pursue.  There are social disadvantages to the fact that when young couples marry both partners have to work.</P>
    <P>Anything we can do to reduce the price of houses should be done.  This Bill will provide a fair measure of success and that is to be welcomed.  Our young people will be gratified by what the Government is proposing to do under this Bill and I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing today probably the most topical political issue of our time, housing needs and house prices.  I have come from a meeting of the Select Committee on the Environment and Local Government at which we had an excellent presentation from Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and the Focus Ireland group.  That organisation and other people in the voluntary sector are dealing at first hand with the outcome of a failed housing policy.  They are picking up on the streets of this city and throughout the country people who are homeless, in inadequate housing and people whose housing concerns and needs have never been met.  I do not expect that tinkering with tax rates, be it stamp duty, capital gains tax, section 23 or whatever, will change our approach to housing.</P>
      <P>The salient point I took from Sr. Stan's presentation this afternoon was that we need a realistic plan for housing, which will provide affordable housing for our people.  Measures dealing with rates of tax or stamp duty will not provide affordable opportunities for people to enter the housing market.  A much greater variety of housing options needs to be made available through the voluntary sector.  The voluntary housing schemes have grown substantially in recent years, but they have grown from a very small base.  We need to examine other examples in the European Union where there is a much greater preponderance of rented accommodation, where there are flexible schemes in existence which allow young people to buy into shares of housing, which allow people to move into rented accommodation for a period and then move into more permanent accommodation.  We have never had that approach to housing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last White Paper on housing was in 1969, the year I was born, 28 years ago.  The Department of Health and Children, the Department of the Environment and Local Government and other Departments are involved with the issue of homelessness or supplementary welfare allowance.  Unlike other EU countries, we do not have a co-ordinated approach to this issue.  Therefore, it is understandable we are in this dilemma.  The contents of the legislation before us or the series <Col N="88" /> of measures announced by the Government will not have any dramatic effect on house prices in terms of making houses more affordable.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Government's dilemma.  I have examined this issue in depth for some time and there is no quick and easy solution.  This problem is complicated.  Attempting to solve it in one area will create a difficulty in another area. One of major difficulties that will arise in the next six to seven months is a rocketing of rents.  People will withdraw from the investment side of the market and that will affect those who need short-term accommodation, people in receipt of social welfare rent allowance, those who have returned to this country and require accommodation for a short period and students who are on the move. The series of proposals in the legislation will not do anything positive for that group.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to respond to two aspects of the legislation in his summation.  Prior to this legislation a 27 year old who decided to purchase a £90,000 house in Dublin &mdash; the average house price is now £100,000 &mdash; could say to the manager of the building society or bank that he or she wished to keep two or three lodgers, friends who might require accommodation for a short period, to get over a difficult financial stage. As a consequence of this legislation that home owner would have to pay stamp duty on such a property because he or she would be keeping one or two lodgers.  If that is the case, we are consigning a section of under 30 year olds to a position where they will never be able to purchase a new home.</P>
    <P>Having studied the legislation in depth, I believe individuals who purchase a home in Dublin and then have to go to work in Cork or Galway for four or five months and rent accommodation there would not be able to rent their homes.  They would have to pay their mortgage on the property they own and would also have to pay rent for such temporary accommodation. Those are two negative impacts of this legislation. I suspect there are ten or 20 other negative aspects to it.  It has not been well thought out.  I made most of my remarks on the general housing area during the debate on the stamp duty resolution in the House some weeks ago.  The Government has not thought out those two specific aspects I outlined.  It will rue the day when it faces some of the implications of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The housing crisis in Dublin poses a serious danger socially.  It has being building up for some time and is a major problem facing the Government and this nation.  The sooner the Government realises we are in the middle of a major housing crisis the better.  I congratulate the Government on the small steps it has taken, with some of which I agree.  At least it has taken some initiatives.  The housing problems are not confined to Dublin.  I represent the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly and there is a problem in almost every town in Ireland.  There is a housing shortage which extends to urban areas.  Given that sites <Col N="89" /> in urban areas sell for in the region of £35,000 to £50,000, alarm bells must be ringing in the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In the 1970s when Fine Gael was in Government we introduced home improvement grants, or reconstruction grants as they were called.  On Fianna Fáil's return to power it abolished those grants.  Later in the 1980s we reintroduced home improvement grants, but again in 1988 Fianna Fáil abolished them.  Under the reconstruction grants about £8,500 was available to people on low and middle incomes who were prepared to buy a property and develop it.  If financial assistance in the form of reconstruction grants was available today it would be an incentive for people to do up their homes or to buy houses that could be renovated or on to which they could build granny flats and so on.  The introduction of such a grant would not cost much money.  It would probably have a greater impact than all the measures in this Bill.  The Government should seriously consider restoring reconstruction grants.</P>
      <P>There is a limited number of serviced sites available to local authorities to sell to suitably qualified applicants.  Local authorities must urgently address the question of land purchase.  If local authorities purchased lands in counties surrounding Dublin and sold sites to applicants it would help to ease the position in Dublin.  Some movement should be made in that respect and I ask the Minister to take that on board.</P>
      <P>Many local authorities have become too restrictive in granting planning permission for domestic dwellings.  I come from a part of Offaly where the population has declined considerably and that is partially because planning authorities are too restrictive.  It is essential that matter is considered.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the measures in this Bill will lead to a shortage of residential accommodation in the form of flats and rented accommodation.  That issue should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address Dr. Bacon's report.  The proposed measures are designed to be of benefit to house buyers, giving them an increased opportunity to secure a home of their own.  The proposals are deficient and inadequate to address the issues that are driving up house prices.  Some of the proposals will cause greater hardship and will result in increased cost to ordinary people.</P>
      <P>The provision of £30 million, targeted at water and sewerage facilities, is far short of what is needed.  The suggestion that £5 million will address the infrastructural deficits is nonsense. Apparently the scope of the problem is not understood by Government.  That money would not even meet the sewage treatment requirements in areas of Fingal such as north Blanchardstown or Swords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Government's handling of the stamp duty issue.  While the reduction in stamp duty is welcome, the effect will be that <Col N="90" /> apartments at the top end of the market will become scarce.  This will have a considerable effect on the quality of living of many people in this sector of the residential community.  In time it will have a negative effect in attracting to Ireland key players from industry and business on medium or short-term contracts.</P>
    <P>The repeal of section 23 is short-sighted.  This incentive is fundamental to the development policy of the Custom House Docks Development Authority as it sets about the improvement of Dublin's docklands.  The scheme has played a major role in ensuring accommodation is available at affordable prices to meet the demands of those who are not prepared to commit to property purchase.  People such as students, those commencing their first job and those on company assignments as well as those thinking of changing houses will suffer because of this decision.  The changes will result in a decrease in the amount of rental accommodation available, while demand for such accommodation will continue to increase.  Because of increased demand and limited supply of accommodation, rental charges will increase.  The increased demand this will place on local authorities will not be met.  Ordinary decent people will suffer unacceptable hardship because of this decision.</P>
    <P>The reduction in capital gains tax by 50 per cent is a folly.  It will not have a positive effect on the generation of housing lands in major urban areas.  The majority of zoned land is already within developers' control.  This measure will not benefit people who are seeking housing.  It will be acceptable to short-term residents, investors and a small niche of the long-term market.  In the main, Irish people like their space and do not wish to be herded into pens.  There is a saying that an Englishman's home is his castle, but an Irishman's house is his home, and no Irishman wants to be stuck in a small box with no room to swing a cat.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe addressed the shared ownership scheme, of which I have been a supporter for a long time.  That scheme operated well, but the escalating price of houses has rendered the scheme useless.  Given that the limit is £60,000, that would not be sufficient to buy any property in the Dublin area.  I spoke to the Fingal county manager today and he welcomes the increase in income eligibility under the scheme from £15,000 to £20,000, but he said that the price limit should be increased to £90,000.  From my inquiries and from meeting people in my advice centres, I believe that it is not possible to buy a home in the Dublin area for £90,000.  This scheme should be considered.  The Fingal county manager has set aside land in the Swords area where the council will build houses and make them available to people who qualify under the shared ownership scheme for about £80,000 to £90,000, which would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>The proposed addition of two members to An Bord Pleanála will have little impact.  Any advantage will be diminished by the shortage of growth <Col N="91" /> in numbers of council planning staff.  Councils around the country are putting off planning applications, especially for housing, by seeking additional information to give them time to catch up with the backlog.  Most managers will admit they have a severe shortage of staff.  They need more staff to ensure that planning applications are properly considered but not held up unduly.</P>
    <P>There would appear to be a view that only zoned land in existing development plans should be developed.  This view ignores the fact that much of the zoned land may not be developed for many years while lands which are immediately serviceable due to their proximity to existing serviced lands shall remain virgin.  People make choices about how and where they live.  If these are ignored due to a shortage of the product they seek, the price will be driven up further.</P>
    <P>The Government has initiated a strategic land use guidelines study for the greater Dublin area, involving the four Dublin local authorities and those in Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.  This study must not be used as a means of slowing down the review of county development plans.  The study will play a major part in ensuring a cohesive and well structured approach is adopted for the region over the next 12 years.  However, it is disappointing that the Department of the Environment and Local Government has reneged on its responsibility to co-fund this report.  It will be left to the local authorities to do so.  The Minister for Finance should raise the matter with that Department to ensure money is made available to get the study under way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest problems of recent years has been the rapid escalation in house prices.  It has had a serious effect in Dublin and in other urban areas.  The effect in Cork has not been as severe as in Dublin, Galway or Waterford.  It has been having a great impact on young people getting married and setting up home.  They are required to take out large loans and their quality of life is affected seriously as a result.  The economy may be booming but if people have to repay large mortgages they have less money available to them for education, recreation and other important pursuits.</P>
      <P>Action must be taken to stem the relentless increase in house prices.  The Bacon report was commissioned and it has put forward proposals. These are not claimed as a panacea for the problems.  It makes some good recommendations and others with which I would not agree fully.  The price of land is a main factor that must be addressed.  Small time builders who might build 15 or 20 houses a year have faced the problem in recent years of buying land at an affordable price. They find it hard to get loans from banks because they cannot provide the security sought.  The larger scale builders are able to pay the prices asked for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A problem facing those seeking to buy land was that people were holding on to land adjacent <Col N="92" /> to urban areas.  They were unwilling to sell land because the capital gains tax was too high.  It was a wise decision to reduce capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  The effect has been immediate because land has come on the market which would not have done so otherwise.  It will take time for the benefit of the change to filter down into house prices.  The benefit derived in the reduction of land prices must be passed to house purchasers.</P>
    <P>One hears of builders increasing the prices of houses at a rapid rate.  However, the increase in the price of land is one of the greatest factors in the increase in house prices and one which it is most important to address.  It will take three or four years for the introduction of serviced land to have its full effect.  However, the action had to be taken at some point.</P>
    <P>I have mixed feelings about the provision on the non-deductability of interest.  It is of no harm in certain conditions to disallow interest, especially when people purchase houses which should be available for first time buyers or families but which are bought by people using their spare funds to generate an asset for themselves. The disallowance of interest against rental income will help put a halt to those who buy up large numbers of houses and use their financial muscle to drive prices out of the reach of ordinary people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 provides that certain premises, including holiday cottages or apartments or other self-catering accommodation will not be allowed the interest deduction.  There is huge demand from tourists in the town of Midleton but a shortage of accommodation.  I know people who were refused planning permission for holiday cottages which are, in effect, a commercial enterprise. Where it is clear that such homes are purely for commercial purposes and will not be used as family <Col N="93" /> homes, relief for interest on borrowed money should be allowed.  I would ask the Minister to consider changing the regulation.</P>
    <P>The measure relating to stamp duty is another attempt to stop prices spiralling.  The measures relating to stamp duty and interest and the reduction in capital gains tax will have a beneficial effect in the medium and long term. However, they are not a complete answer because, in the real world, the market will determine the price.  However, if the market goes out of control we can step in with some controls and guidelines to keep it on an even keel.</P>

      <P>I wish to echo the sentiments expressed earlier by Deputy Kelleher in relation to the difficulty in obtaining planning permission in rural Ireland.  It is becoming an immense problem for young couples who have sites on their own farms and are finding it virtually impossible to get planning permission.  I had one individual crying on the phone this evening who is to get married in the early autumn and has no place to live as of today.</P>
      <P>Recently we had a debate in this House on the rapidly increasing numbers of young people sleeping rough on our streets.  This is a major crisis facing our capital city and many other larger towns.  To date little has been done to alleviate this problem, one which will go on growing during the summer months and leave a bad taste in the mouths of people visiting this country during the tourist season.</P>
      <P>I am delighted, however, to see that the Government is now tackling the current problem in the housing market.  This has come about through the continued pressure the Fine Gael Party has put on the Government over the past number of months.</P>
      <P>There is a sense of desperation among young people in relation to the purchase of houses.  They are being forced out of the housing market by investors and into private rented accommodation provided by these same investors.  In my county town of Roscommon, in a rural constituency, house prices have risen by up to 20 per cent in the past six months.  It is impossible for young people to compete with this rapid rise in house prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major incentive would be to abolish stamp duty on secondhand houses for all first time buyers.  The Minister is proposing only a piecemeal approach to the abolition of stamp duty on this type of house.  At present stamp duty is a massive disincentive to buying a previously owned home and is driving young people further and further away from urban centres and, most probably, also away from their workplace.  Its removal would allow people to purchase secondhand homes in <Col N="94" /> established areas with existing services such as public transport, schools, churches, shops and medical services.  The removal of stamp duty on secondhand houses would stimulate the second-hand market and relieve the current enormous demand for new houses.  It would also help to rejuvenate many of our rural communities that have seen rapid population decline, and thereby ensure the viability of schools and post offices.</P>
    <P>I have one note of warning in relation to the proposal to abolish the offset of mortgage interest against income for tax purposes.  This will lead to a dramatic increase in rents.  As the Minister is aware, the majority of students enter the rented accommodation sector.  The housing shortage for students has already reached crisis point.  Not only is there a lack of quality accommodation but rents have soared over the past few years.  Here in Dublin, young people are paying anything up to £50 or £60 per week for accommodation. Therefore, rent for many students amounts almost to the sum total of their maintenance, if they are lucky enough to get a maintenance grant. Students are a vulnerable group in the housing market and any increase in already exorbitant rents will be catastrophic.  This, coupled with the proposed increase in student intake in many of our third level colleges around the country, will see many students without accommodation as they enter or return to college in the autumn.  It is a badly thought out proposal by the Minister. He should have considered the cost of housing and rented accommodation and the lack of an increase in the maintenance grant for young people.  The lack of an equitable maintenance grant is crippling young people and making it extremely difficult for the vast majority to survive in college today.  The Minister must tackle inequalities in the rented accommodation sector. Otherwise we will see many of our college students waking up under a cardboard box before cycling to college.  That is what will happen if inequalities are not remedied in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Today the Minister for Finance announced amendments to this Bill which will encourage residential investment in the new rural renewal areas.  This announcement must be welcomed, but it is unfair to discriminate against parts of counties, especially in the case of County Roscommon. This division of County Roscommon is blatant discrimination against the mid and southern areas of the county.  The current proposal is that north Roscommon will have special incentives and the towns of Roscommon, Athlone and Ballinasloe are set to be approved for urban renewal.  This will move investment out of the rural area of south Roscommon and destroy the community, the direct opposite of the objective of this scheme.  Already a number of important tourism projects have been frozen in this area because of the unconsidered proposal of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The south Roscommon area has a pressing need for new investment incentives.  In common with other areas which have been included, the <Col N="95" /> rural heartland of south Roscommon has experienced economic decline, depopulation, loss of services and a lack of new investment.  It also has an underdeveloped tourism base, a high dependence on the declining agricultural sector, poor infrastructure, inadequate employment opportunities and an ageing population.  The exclusion of south Roscommon is also inconsistent, given that the whole of County Roscommon is designated as disadvantaged under the local development programme and all of county Roscommon is included in the catchment area of the Western Development Commission which is aiming to counteract population decline in the region.  The fragmentation of the county for the purposes of this scheme by the Department of Finance will create unnecessary inequality and division.  In the light of this, I would urge the Minister to include an additional amendment to this Bill and include south Roscommon, thereby creating a level playing field for the whole of County Roscommon and the whole of the constituency of Longford-Roscommon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright highlighted the problem of reconstruction grants.  This is a very important point.  If we are to encourage young people to live in rural Ireland we need to reintroduce reconstruction grants.  It is vital to the rejuvenation of rural communities.  Developing dilapidated buildings will also improve our local environment. There are many villages and towns throughout rural Ireland with large buildings that have become dilapidated because people cannot afford to maintain them.  I have received numerous requests about the reintroduction of such a grant because people are willing to invest in such buildings and they should be given the opportunity to do so.  I urge the Minister to table an additional amendment regarding reconstruction grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Naughten for sharing time with me.  Earlier, speakers referred to the practice of gazumping and stated it was a new phenomenon which had arisen over the past 12 months.  I suffered from it in 1989 when I went to buy a house and I am sure it existed before then.  Deputy O'Flynn claimed this practice was based around Dublin but I assure him it affects builders and developers nationwide and is not just confined to the capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the capital gains tax of 60 per cent on land disposed of after 5 April 2002.  I do not know how effective this will be because many investors, such as business people, farmers and PAYE workers, will have to put their money elsewhere following the removal of tax relief on non-residential property.  I fear people will sell their land in panic between now and 2002 and having money they do not wish to invest in property, they might invest it in land.  We will then find ourselves in a difficult situation again in four years' time when many wealthy people will have sold off potential development land which would have <Col N="96" /> been available under normal circumstances.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>I recall in the early 1980s when the building industry went through a rough period various schemes were introduced for the trade, such as urban renewal and grants for pre-1950 houses. Those practices resulted from builders lobbying for the industry.  In ten or 15 years' time my colleague, Deputy Gerry Reynolds, might be the Minister for Finance and if the builders come to him will he recall current conditions?</P>
    <P>There are many stories of builders calling on their solicitors who also happen to be auctioneers and an extra £5,000 being added to the price of houses.  They basically manipulate the market and the fears of individuals.  I will be devil's advocate as we all suffer from greed to a certain degree.  If one put one's house on the market, was offered £100,000 and tentatively made an arrangement, what would one do if another individual offered £110,000 the following day?</P>
    <P>I refer to section 1(e)(iii) which deals with the disallowance of relief on mortgage interest.  The Minister stated &ldquo;neither will it apply to holiday cottages or holiday apartments in other parts of the country registered or listed with Bord Fáilte where the planning permission specifically states that the premises are not to be rented or leased for periods in excess of two successive calendar months at any one time&rdquo;.  I assume the phrase &ldquo;in excess of two successive calendar months at any one time&rdquo; is included because it is a condition applied to planning by some local authorities. However, the condition generally stipulated by Wicklow County Council for such a scheme is that the proposed dwellings shall be used only as holiday houses and not as permanent residences. They shall all remain available for short-term holiday letting.  Will the Minister clarify if short-term holiday lettings come under that category?</P>

      <P>If Deputy Timmins runs for leader of my party, I will vote for him if I become Minister for Finance.  I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  This legislation is being introduced because of the difficulties in the housing market and it is an extremely difficult issue to legislate for because the open market drives up the price of property.</P>
      <P>My only complaint concerns the reduction in stamp duty.  It was a good idea but will be totally ineffective.  I hail from County Leitrim which is the least populated area in Ireland and has the lowest house prices.  One would not buy a house for under £60,000.  The Minister should consider the abolition of stamp duty on second hand houses for first time buyers if he wants to help individuals who find it next to impossible to get into the property market, particularly in large urban areas.  The incentive provided will probably not be successful and will not solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for having the guts to introduce the rural renewal scheme.  We have been calling for it for a long time and when Fine Gael was in Government it did not happen, <Col N="97" /> unfortunately.  It will be of benefit to certain areas and will provide incentives for various developments.  However, the biggest difficulty concerns lack of population, especially where I come from. Frank Brennan, a tax consultant from Leitrim, told me there was a huge problem with Athens which became overpopulated.  The Greek Government, in its wisdom, provided a tax incentive for people to move from Athens back to their native communities.  For example, if one was a native of Leitrim and lived in Dublin and set up one's residence in Leitrim, one received a large tax incentive to do so.  The population of Athens reduced by one million people which was of huge benefit and helped rural Greece.</P>
    <P>An imaginative scheme such as that needs to be implemented to try to resolve the problem of depopulation.  I welcome the rural renewal scheme because it will go some way towards helping the area I represent economically and socially. We must be more imaginative and should wait for a few years to examine the benefits of this scheme.  My colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, has spoken to me on a number of occasions regarding the concept of building a new city.  Milton Keynes in England is an example where educational and medical facilities were concentrated in one area. We must try to do that because everybody wants to move into an urban centre as evidenced by changes in the agricultural community.  If the continuation of growth in urban centres is allowed, it will be organised chaos.  We must come up with a system where consideration would be given to building new towns.  There is plenty of development land in my area, but we do not have the people.  If the Government implemented this policy over a number of years, it would benefit many rural areas.  The Minister has witnessed the urbanisation of County Kildare by people from the west, north-west and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I compliment him on introducing the rural renewal scheme, but other measures would make it more worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to add to what my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party have said about the many shortcomings in the Bill.  I merely want to bring a few points to the Minister's attention, but I do not know if that is realistic before Committee Stage because he appears to be hell bent on getting the Bill through at a fairly rapid lick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has imposed a restriction on tax relief against rental income and a number of people, who are not to blame for the rise in residential property prices, will be victims of this measure.  It will pose problems for people on his own doorstep.  For example, it is fairly common practice for many of the multinational firms located here to rent accommodation for their staff.  Some of their employees are involved in the Irish operation for a relatively short period of time to get a particular job done or as part of a training programme and the firm provides accommodation for them.  As the number of such staff <Col N="98" /> fluctuates, the purchase of property is not an option.</P>
    <P>The firm must, therefore, look to the rental market for accommodation and go to the people characterised in this debate as the investors who are driving up the price of residential accommodation.  Those investors provide accommodation on a flexible basis for firms like Intel and Hewlett Packard, which are on the Minister's doorstep.  If, as a result of this Bill, firms find it difficult to find accommodation for their staff, some of their key employees will be less inclined to come here.</P>
    <P>The Minister may believe this is not a major problem in the overall scheme of things, but it will constitute an unnecessary complication in life for those firms.  While they are likely to face such a problem when they locate in a country with a high preference for owner-occupation housing, we should not deliberately set out to make life more difficult for them.  As the Minister is aware, these firms are located all over the country.  There are people living in this type of accommodation within a short distance of where I live.  This problem stems from the haste with which the Bill was prepared.  I am surprised the Minister would lend his name to this type of approach to legislation. When he was on this side of the House he pointed out &mdash; I occasionally agreed with him &mdash; that if one legislates in haste to get in front of public opinion, one usually makes a mess of it.  That is what is happening with this Bill.  As an economist, it is not surprising that I would not accept all Dr. Bacon's conclusions, but the Minister has a greater obligation because he introduced the legislation.  It bears the marks of a hastily put together Bill to conform more to pandering to a public prejudice rather than dealing with the problem, but the results will be evident in the difficulties to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Some people still live in accommodation provided by their employers which they must vacate when they retire or their contracts end.  This includes a diverse group of people.  It includes, for example, some clergy persons from the Church of Ireland who are obliged to live in the accommodation provided with the parish, but who know they will have to move out when they retire to make room for the incoming incumbent.  Some of them have the foresight to purchase a house or an apartment during their working careers and rent it out to pay the mortgage.  They do so legitimately using the relief currently available to finance the provision of living accommodation for their retirement.  The Minister knows some people fail to make that provision for themselves and when they reach their sixties do not have enough savings to buy a house and have gone past the age at which they can get a mortgage on reasonable terms.  This Bill will make it impossible for such people to provide accommodation for when they retire, except at a much higher cost. The Minister is closing off that avenue for those people.  The Bill includes what the Minister called a provision for pipeline cases, but that will not solve the problem for those who are currently in <Col N="99" /> that position, for those who move into that position at the end of this year or for those who are not in a position to purchase a property before the end of the year.  The Minister is creating a new problem for these people.</P>
    <P>He believes the restriction on tax relief will directly address the difficulty identified in the Bacon report that investors are to some extent replacing first time buyers in the market, a development which the Minister stated &ldquo;goes totally against the thrust of housing policy objectives accepted over recent decades&rdquo;.  Even if that is the case, it is not a good enough reason for adopting this measure.  The investor-private rental sector responds to a need in the market.  If this goes against the thrust of housing policy objectives accepted in recent decades, perhaps it simply means housing policy objectives have not moved with the times.  The market has identified and responded to a need.  If that differs from housing policy objectives over recent decades, it is at least possible that the way to deal with the problem is to examine those objectives.  In Ireland, as in many European countries, there are people who do not want to buy but prefer to rent accommodation because it does not suit them to take on a mortgage at their point in life.  I will not enter into sociological speculation but a substantial and increasing number of people do not want to take on the obligations associated with a mortgage and they have perfectly good reasons for doing so.</P>
    <P>It is not a good basis for policy to accept the cant of which we hear so much, that there is something wrong with investors who make property available.  Other countries take a different view.  I lived for a period in Belgium where, in the normal course of events, most people do not buy accommodation until they are in their fifties &mdash; until then they save money and rent somewhere to live.  If they are reasonably well off, they buy not one dwelling unit but several and become &ldquo;investors&rdquo;&mdash; a word after one is supposed to spit these days.  They let out the property units in which they are not living, which provides them with a nice supplement to their pension when they retire.  They are not doing anything evil and in Belgium neither the public, the Minister for Finance nor commentators demonise them as people who are driving up the price of property. It is accepted as normal there that the accommodation market is made up of different segments which go up and down at various times.  The Minister should have thought a good deal more carefully before giving this justification for a measure which will undoubtedly cause problems.</P>
    <P>The capital gains tax provisions of the Bill will also be disruptive.  An example of this was outlined to me recently by a gentleman who is well-known to the Minister.  He is in the auctioneering business and last week brokered a sale on a parcel of land.  The planning authority for the area where the land is located will in all probability zone that land for development in the near <Col N="100" /> future.  However, no development can take place until that authority and the adjoining one build a sewage treatment plant to deal with the needs of the area, which will take some time.  Even if the development of this land takes place before 5 April 2002, capital gains tax on the transfer will be at the 40 per cent rate rather than at the lower rate provided for in this Bill to encourage the rapid mobilisation of land.  The only way out of this is to rescind the sales agreement, if the parties assent to do so, and for the original owner to apply for planning permission before 5 April 2002.  I do not know whether that would be an onerous requirement in this case but it is not something which the parties to the transaction considered as a possibility.</P>
    <P>Similar cases, possibly with shorter planning horizons, will arise all over the country and we will hear more about them as the days go by. Vendors who are not themselves developers and have no involvement in planning will have to apply for planning permission in order to reduce their capital gains tax liability from 40 per cent or even 60 per cent to 20 per cent.  A great many will conclude they should do this because the difference between the two rates could involve a substantial amount of money, and that will put serious pressure on planning authorities.  In any case, between 23 April 1998 and 5 April 2002 it is inevitable, under the provisions of this Bill, that many more people who sell land for development but are not themselves developers will be applying for planning permission.  I do not know how the planning authorities will deal with this but it will cause problems and may also affect the quality of developments put forward for planning permission or the number of those which are completed.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not explain, when introducing the Bill, why he chose to follow this path.  Perhaps he could take the opportunity to clarify the following remark:</P>
    <P>The consultants were not specific in their definition of what should constitute serviced land and, consequently, I have decided to link the 20 per cent rate to the planning process. This is a transparent way of implementing the Government decision.</P>
    <P>Unlike me the Minister does not need glasses but if he thinks that is transparent he must have great eyesight.  I do not know what he regards as transparent but that way of explaining the measure is as clear as mud.  Deciding to link the 20 per cent rate to the planning process because the consultants were not specific in their definition of serviced land is a slipshod way to draft a Bill.  If the Minister had a problem about defining serviced land he should have thought longer than he evidently did before concluding that he should link the 20 per cent rate to the planning process. There is no earthly way that it is obvious to link the two; the tax rate could be linked to many other considerations but the planning process would not immediately suggest itself to me, and <Col N="101" /> if I am wrong about that I want to hear why.  It is not desirable that, between now and 5 April 2002, many people who would not otherwise seek planning permission or design developments will have to do so in order to pay capital gains tax at 20 per cent rather than 60 per cent.  In his rush to do the popular thing and appear to solve one set of problems, the Minister will leave us with a completely different set.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has a place where he can speak privately without other people hearing him, there must have been moments since the report was published and the Government announced its acceptance of it when he asked himself why he became involved in this.  As the debate has progressed he must have realised that the Government has created more problems than it has tried to solve.  We all shared the concern that the housing market was overheated and it was becoming more difficult for young people to buy affordable property.  It seemed necessary to ensure an adequate supply but it was purely a question of supply and demand &mdash; if there was sufficient supply to meet demand prices would find their level.  Both the Government and the Bacon report have made the mistake of assuming the housing market is a homogeneous entity.  It may have been a fairly homogeneous entity 20, 25 or 30 years ago when those who had reasonably good jobs bought houses and lived in them as happily married couples, while those who were unable to buy houses or who were not married went into the rental market.</P>
      <P>The current housing market is not made up of the traditional young couple who saved to buy a house, bought it and moved into it when they married.  Those couples did not move into the house together before they married.  Such traditional type buyers are now almost in the minority. Young couples now buy a house and rent it out until they get married, because that helps them with the mortgage repayments, but under this legislation they will be unable to do that.</P>
      <P>Some young couples buy a house, move into it before they get married and sublet part of the property.  Single people buy houses and share the accommodation with two or three others as a means of helping with mortgage repayments or simply making provision for the future.  Those people will now be put out of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to be trying to prevent the investor getting his hands on accommodation and putting up prices for people who want to buy houses.  I agree there is a problem with the type of investor who buys ten apartments off the plans of a particular scheme for the purposes of renting them out.  That practice has damaged the market, but the type of people I know who would come under the heading of &ldquo;investor&rdquo; are Mr. and Mrs. Murphy who live down the road.  He may have received a gratuity in his job or perhaps they have come into some money from an elderly relative who has died.  They have children in the 13,14 and 15 years age bracket for whom they have <Col N="102" /> ambitions that they will work in Dublin or go to university.  These people decide, with the little money they have and perhaps through remortgaging their own home, to invest money in a property which will be available for their children when they go to work in the city or go to university.</P>
    <P>The Minister should talk to some of the people selling apartments, particularly in the county area.  They are the investors who are buying property, apart from the few who have money to buy four or five properties at a time.  The others are being bought by single unit investors who want to provide for the future of their children.  Those people will now be taken out of that market.</P>
    <P>What happens to the property they have invested in heretofore but which their children are not ready to avail of?  They may decide that they will not need their four bedroomed house when the children leave home, but they do not want to leave the area in which they live.  Those people buy property when it is fortuitous to do so and they let the property to somebody who may have got a job in the area.  That person may not know whether the job will be permanent or perhaps they are in the middle of a training period and do not want to buy locally.  They may be able to afford to buy a house but instead choose to rent.  The couples who buy these houses and rent them are fulfilling a need for rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>One of my fears about the Minister's plans is that he has been unable to estimate, nor has the Bacon report, the enormous effect these proposals will have on the rented sector.  I invite the Minister to go to Parnell Square on any Friday at 2.30 p.m. and see the number of brown bread buses, as they are known, taking young men and women back to their home villages and towns. Those young people are crucial to those villages and towns because they bring with them the income they have earned.  They keep these areas alive and help businesses continue to operate. Many of these villages and towns are very quiet during the week but they know all the young people return home at the weekend.  These young people are not in the market for buying property, they are in the rented sector.  People who have spoken to me about the Minister's proposals say that supply in that sector will be reduced, the demand will remain and prices will increase.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister that the Eastern Health Board is paying out £38.4 million per annum &mdash; 59 per cent of its expenditure &mdash; to assist the rented sector.  The board is the largest company involved in the rented sector in this country.  Seventeen thousand units per month get assistance from the Eastern Health Board &mdash; £33.3 million in the Dublin area and £5.1 million in the Wicklow-Kildare area.  A total of 39,000 people get assistance from the health board. Approximately 10,500 of those are eligible to be on a council housing list, and may be on a list, but they will be dead before they ever get to the top of that list.  If those people are not in a position <Col N="103" /> to rent properties we will see an increase in homelessness and in demand for bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation.</P>
    <P>Approximately 28,000 of the 39,000 single people getting assistance will never get on to a council housing list.  People in the health board have expressed the fear that with this reduction in the number of people going into the rented sector and the number of properties that will be available, the health board bill will continue to increase.  The board will have to increase its expenditure to pay the rent.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1995, the health board paid out rents of up to £400 per month.  In January of this year that was increased to £550 per month.  The board is doing a mid-term review and may have to do another at the end of this year.  The result of that review undoubtedly will be that by the end of this year the health board bill will increase enormously because higher rents will be charged.</P>
    <P>Consideration has not been given to the effect of the Minister's proposals.  At the very least I hope the Minister will seriously consider removing the restriction on the tax benefit where houses are divided into flats approximately one year before this proposal.  If those houses come on the market and are bought as going concerns and used as rented property, people must be allowed to buy them on the same basis they would have bought them prior to 23 April.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in the south inner city approximately six such houses in one small area are on the market which between them have 100 to 200 separate units of accommodation.  If those houses cannot be sold as going concerns with their rented accommodation, and if the tax benefits cannot be availed of, they will probably go on the market to single owner buyers who have £500,000, £600,000 or £700,000 to spend and they will be turned back into single family units.  That is not good in the city of Dublin.  Since the Minister's acceptance of the Bacon report, which he has tried to interpret, he has made changes to the legislation.  I do not see any reason he cannot take these changes on board.  He will have an opportunity to take amendments tomorrow on Committee Stage and in the Seanad.  While I accept he wants to rush the legislation through, for the sake of another week or two it is crucial that the changes be made.</P>
    <P>On the issue of the removal of stamp duty for houses under £60,000, I defy the Minister to find a property for £60,000.  He has not a hope of finding such a property in Dublin and even outside it, in the remotest area houses are fetching prices of more than £60,000.  If they are not they are so dilapidated and in need of so much repair they are not worth buying except for the site, to knock them down and rebuild.  I urge the Minister to reconsider that proposal and to accept the Fine Gael proposal that the figure should be £100,000 free of stamp duty for first time buyers.</P>
    <P>What is happening since the Minister's announcement &mdash; I accept he cannot do anything <Col N="104" /> about it &mdash; where young couples thought they had fixed a price for buying houses, is that estate agents and owners are now informing them that the house on which they had paid a deposit has increased in price by £2,000.  I know of one specific case in my constituency.  The house price had been fixed and a deposit had been paid.  The good news was that the buyers would save £2,000 on the stamp duty but then they received a telephone call from the estate agents to inform them the seller was asking for an extra £2,000.  It means that the saving for the young couple trying to buy a house and make a home for themselves and their children has been lost because of the greed of people who realise they will save £2,000.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything to prevent that kind of gazumping or ensure that when a deposit is paid and there is an agreed price, it cannot be increased on the basis of this extra benefit.</P>
    <P>I turn to capital gains tax and what the Minister is trying to do in respect of land.  In the auctioneering and estate agency world there used to be three important words in regard to buying property, &ldquo;location, location, location&rdquo;.  In regard to development land there are three important words, &ldquo;services, services, services&rdquo;.  As councillors, in the 1980s, we suffered the slings and arrows of our peers, the media and all types of criticism when we recognised that County Dublin was the only area with land and that we might have to look beyond the five year development plans but we were not allowed do so.  Every time we said there was a need for forward planning we were told it could not be done in the absence of the services and that money would be put into the hands of owners, developers, farmers and so on.  I am sorry to say that, like many councillors, I took those criticisms to heart and we did not plan for the future.  If adequate land had been zoned and even if it had taken ten years to provide the services we would now have a decent land bank with services coming on board.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to follow all the tables in Mr. Bacon's report.  Fingal County Council conducted a survey of the available lands for housing in its area.  This is the one prime area where there is a great deal of land within six to ten miles of Dublin.  If one goes south from O'Connell Street one would have to travel 15 to 20 miles before reaching the country whereas if one goes north from O'Connell Street to Fairview and the Malahide Road one would reach it after about six or seven miles.  It is all very well for Bacon to conduct his survey and say there is X number of hectares of serviced land but he forgets to take into account that some of that serviced land is in one area.  It means that everyone looking for a house will have to go to Blanchardstown.  He also fails to recognise that where there may be some serviced land, for example, in Balbriggan, the sewage treatment plant is way beyond its capacity.  In the absence of building new services we cannot put more sewage into those plants given that another directive, which has to be implemented by 2000, <Col N="105" /> provides that raw sewage cannot be put into the sea.  That is right and proper.  It may technically be called serviced land but the plants servicing those lands are not in a position to take any more capacity.  It is nonsense to say we have enough serviced land for X number of units although it may appear that way on paper.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept of strengthening villages on the outer perimeters of Dublin rather than allowing big sprawls to develop.  A nice village in some cases has the capacity for 500 or 1,000 houses.  If planning permission is sought for one bungalow in Lusk it will be refused by Fingal County Council due to insufficient capacity.  If one were to attempt to install one of these new systems, the rules and regulations which apply means it is not worth while.  Months later that person is almost demented in an effort to get planning permission.</P>
    <P>Dr. Bacon did not speak to me or to anybody dealing with people who are trying to get hold of some of the serviced lands on which to build, particularly in the Fingal area.  The Minister is bent on reducing capital gains tax.  He said that to qualify for the temporary reduction in the capital gains tax rate on a disposal of development land, planning permission must have been acquired prior to the disposal.  Is the Minister talking about development land already zoned or land which is good for development purposes?  If it is the latter before anyone can obtain planning permission it has to be rezoned or go through a material contravention.  It is difficult to get through the material contravention procedure because three quarters of councillors must be present and vote in favour.  Given people's commitment and even if they were all in favour, getting a vote for a material contravention is a lengthy process.  If one is trying to dispose of development land, planning permission has to be obtained.  Will the Minister clarify whether he is talking about small areas which have actually been zoned but have not yet obtained planning permission?  The reason they have not got the planning permission is because of the lack of services and council planners have to obey a particular regulation.  If one wanted planning permission, and there was not sufficient capacity to drain the land, it would be refused. There will be a difficulty for people who might have land contiguous to the development area which is not zoned.  If they want to avail of the 20 per cent and are willing to sell they have to seek planning permission which puts an onus on councillors to rezone land which attracts criticism from journalists and so on who think rezoning is forbidden.</P>
    <P>With no disrespect to those who wrote that section of the report, obviously they are in the Department of Finance, I do not believe they ever sat at a council meeting and listened to the difficulties in regard to turning muck into development land, turning that development land into zoned land and obtaining planning permission for it.  If so they would not have written this section because it will not do anything to <Col N="106" /> increase the quantity of housing to reduce the price for first time buyers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the contribution made by Deputies. The range and extent of comments underlines the importance and relevance of this issue.  I know that Deputies have been lobbied by the house building sector to reverse an important element of the Bill on interest deductibility and this was reflected in a number of contributions.</P>
      <P>In my opening remarks I emphasised the question of balance.  The proposals in the Bill are designed to restore a balance to the housing sector &mdash; a balance between supply and demand, between investors and owner occupiers and between tax concessions and removal of reliefs. In any such situation there must be winners and losers.  The important question is not the extent of the win or the loss but the overall policy goals being pursued.  These are to increase the supply of serviced land, to reduce excess investor demand and to assist ordinary house purchasers, thus defusing the house price spiral and increasing the affordability of housing.</P>
      <P>In recent days we have witnessed the unacceptable facets of house price inflation &mdash; profit margins increasing and substantial increases on previously advertised prices.  Inadequate supply and excess demand are what drive this phenomenon.  In this Bill the Government is not seeking to undo the property market or to harm market participants.  Even with the removal of interest deductibility, there will be still be a basic and strong demand for residential accommodation.  The house building sector appears to accept this in its recently circulated submission.</P>
      <P>To suggest that demand for accommodation is entirely tax driven is not sustainable.  Tax reliefs played their part in stimulating demand and reviving the property market when it was flat. However, the case for continued favourable tax reliefs at a time of a property boom is far less convincing.</P>
      <P>It is worth quoting from the Bacon report on the reasoning behind the removal of interest deductibility and the imposition of stamp duty on new houses purchased by non-owner occupiers.  It states:</P>
      <P>.there are certain measures which, if taken, would result in a better balance between demand and supply in the short term.  In essence, rebalancing of existing fiscal incentives, which currently support investment demand in a number of respects, towards the promotion of housing supply to the end of the market where affordability pressures are greatest, is considered both desirable and feasible.</P>
      <P>The report goes on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>.there is evidence that changing patterns of housing demand are sufficient to support a <Col N="107" /> growing and more diversified rented sector, for example, rental values appear to be well underpinned.  What is in doubt is the need to encourage this demand by means of fiscal incentives, especially when the revenue foregone in this direction could be focused better towards increasing supply and choice to first time buyers who are facing affordability strain.</P>
    <P>As pointed out in the report, the main effect of the proposed measures would be to remove fiscal supports to residential demands at a time when underlying demand is extremely strong.  The benefits from moving in this direction would be, among other things, to provide a more level playing field between investors and home owners and to allow investment in residential property to be determined by underlying market forces for additional rented accommodation at a time when economic and social changes are leading to an increase in the depth and breadth of demand for such accommodation.</P>
    <P>Clearly there are arguments and concerns on both sides.  Deputy Noonan is right to voice these in respect of the rental market, but I agree with Deputies McDowell and Rabbitte that the dire prognostications for the rental sector are overstated.  There is a demand for rented accommodation, not just notional demand, to borrow Deputy Noonan's analogy, but effective demand. There will not be supernormal profits.  That some of those currently renting can now afford to buy as a result of this package will free up a certain amount of the existing stock of rental property. We are changing the balance in the market but are also pursuing measures to increase supply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the 1998 budget as the cause of the current excess demand.  The problem with house prices started well before then but was not tackled until now.  In my budget, the cut in the marginal rates of income tax reduced the value of mortgage interest relief. Further, I also applied restrictions on capital allowances for property, which helped to dampen investor demand in that area.  This measure, and the restriction of interest relief in this Bill, will also remove the significant tax shelters which, as the survey I published last February pointed out, can result in some persons on high incomes reducing their tax bill to practically nil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said that the requirement to have planning permission for residential development to qualify for the lower rate capital gains tax will delay the release of land to the market. This point was made in subsequent contributions. I will deal with this matter on Committee Stage when there will be more time to reply to some of the detailed comments made by a wide range of Deputies.  However, it will be sufficient to obtain outline permission.  The section refers to planning permission for residential development granted under section 26 of the Local Government <Col N="108" /> (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  This covers full and outline planning permission.</P>
    <P>The requirements for documentation to accompany an application for outline permission are not onerous.  Only such particulars as are necessary for the planning authority to make a decision in relation to siting and layout are required.  A full designed scheme is, therefore, not necessary.  The only exception to this is that outline planning permission cannot be availed of for large projects which are subject to an environmental impact assessment.  In this case full planning permission must be sought.  For residential-type developments, an environmental impact assessment would only arise in relation to urban development projects which would involve an area greater than 125 acres in new or extended urban areas and greater than five acres within existing urban areas.  These would be a small minority of cases.</P>
    <P>While there will be some delay in bringing to the market land which does not already have residential planning permission, the land could not be brought into residential development without valid planning permission.  Planning permission would, therefore, have to be obtained in any event.</P>
    <P>Where land is zoned for residential development and the necessary services are available, there should be no difficulty in acquiring outline permission.  The existence of outline permission should make it easier for the purchaser to obtain approval for development as the issues of principle will have been decided at outline stage. Given that planning permissions only have a life of five years, linking the relief to planning permission will help to ensure that serviced residentially zoned land is developed, which is our objective.</P>
    <P>Considerable thought was given to the phrasing of this section.  The Bacon report referred to serviced and development land.  I considered the matter with my officials and it was decided, rather than become involved in the complexities of defining serviced and zoned land, to take the simplest way out and make a provision regarding the granting of planning permission.  Deputy Dukes made a number of points on this.  It is best to simplify matters.</P>

      <P>The farmer or whoever owns the land must get planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I am sure considerable expertise would be made available to a farmer to help him get permission if he considered selling his land.  The restriction on capital gains tax is of benefit to the farmer selling the land.  Companies purchasing such land &mdash; most developers are companies &mdash; which build houses and trade in development land are subject to corporation tax, which is currently at 32 per cent. <Col N="109" /> The 20 per cent rate of capital gains tax is only of benefit to the farmer who sells it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister do something to clarify the date?  A developer could take an option with a farmer and engage in the planning process.  Unless it is fixed on the date of the contract when the option was taken out as against the date of disposal the applicant will run into difficulty in claiming the relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>He must have the land disposed of by 5 April 2002 and a planning application granted in respect of that land.  There are various contracts which people will enter into but the land will have to be disposed of by 5 April 2002.</P>
      <P>The purpose in reducing the rate of capital gains tax to 20 per cent is to release development land on to the market and to have houses built on it.  That was the perspective from which Dr. Bacon approached the issue.  The philosophical arguments about capital gains tax rates which Deputy McDowell and I might discuss and which Deputy Noonan and I discussed forcefully on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill did not enter his thinking.</P>
      <P>Linking the reduced rate of capital gains tax to planning permission is transparent and easy for the landowner and tax inspector.  It uses a system which is well understood and involves public participation and an independent appeals process. Over 70 per cent of planning applications are decided by planning authorities within two months.  In the event of an appeal there will be a delay.  The average time taken by An Bord Pleanála to decide appeals is now running at 18 weeks. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is taking action to ensure that in 1999, 90 per cent of appeals will be decided within four months.</P>
      <P>I will move an amendment on Committee Stage to allow the 20 per cent rate of capital gains tax to apply to land sold to local authorities without planning permission which can be used for housing.  This should ease supply problems in particular cases and may go some way to meet Deputy Noonan's concern.  The need for this amendment was brought to our attention by the local authority in Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Rabbitte, referred to certain market practices which are unacceptable and contrary to the interests of consumers.  These include the practice of the phased release of new developments which is used to ratchet up prices, the return of booking deposits and subsequent gazumping of prices and instances of excessive stage payments.  The Bacon report referred to these practices and stressed that they were not widespread but that where <Col N="110" /> they occurred it was to the detriment of consumers.  We have become aware that this sharp practice is growing.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, indicated on the Adjournment last night, the most effective way to prevent such problems is to remove the conditions that allow them to happen.  Bacon considered that if the market was not in excess demand in the first instance, it would be difficult for builders to engage in such practices.  The package of measures announced by the Government is designed to counter the market conditions which allow these practices to grow.  Even if Deputy Shatter is not entirely satisfied with this line, it is better to tackle the causes of the problem rather than the symptoms.</P>
    <P>The consultants recommended a code of best practice but if it is found that such a code cannot be implemented effectively on a voluntary basis by the professional representative body of home builders, we should widen the statutory powers of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs. As the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said, he will be raising these issues with the Irish Home Builders Association at the earliest opportunity with a view to pursuing the voluntary approach.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Rabbitte's point about certain intermediaries changing contractual or negotiating practices to facilitate price increases.  I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who is responsible for consumer and contract law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte welcomed the provisions in the Bill dealing with interest deductibility and said we should have acted in the budget.  I will not say that it did not cross my mind but it was best to await the authoritative and comprehensive report produced by the consultants to see what recommendations it contained.  The Bacon report stands on its own analysis.  It is not the view of the Minister for Finance or the Department by proxy.  There were consultations with the Department which would be normal.  The cost of the report, give or take a few hundred pounds, was £85,000, including VAT.</P>
    <P>Deputies Noonan and McDowell raised the issue of stamp duty relief for first time buyers of secondhand houses.  I accept the motivation for their proposals in this regard.  I will deal with the other points raised on Committee Stage tomorrow, including some of the philosophical arguments advanced by Deputy Dukes.  Economists and accountants differ.  Dr. Bacon produced his report and the Government is acting on it.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Light Rail Project: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Yates on 12 May 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government's failure to approve the Luas proposal as designed involving the loss of £114 million in Structural Funds to this project and thereby prolonging the very severe traffic congestion problems of Dublin indefinitely and further deplores the manner in which the Government has announced a plan which is uncosted, has no technical design or specification and for which there is no timeframe.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. a1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>(a) welcomes the Government decision to proceed with a light rail network comprising:</P>
    <P>a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station based on the CIE preferred alignment from Tallaght to O'Connell Street, and a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport, using the Harcourt Street and Broadstone disused railway alignments and with an underground section in the city centre;</P>
    <P>(b) supports the Government's objective of proceeding without delay with the construction of the Tallaght to city centre and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections and notes that this is subject to the relevant statutory procedures and detailed technical confirmation;</P>
    <P>(c) endorses the Government's reaffirmation of its commitment to the implementation of the current transportation strategy recommended by the Dublin Transportation Office and notes that the office will shortly publish an Action Plan recommending short-term measures to address Dublin's traffic problems;</P>
    <P>(d) welcomes the Government decision to proceed with the implementation of a number of road schemes required for traffic management in Dublin City.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Labour Party amendment will be accepted.  Having come through a successful by-election campaign, I can confirm that one of the major concerns for the constituents of Dublin North is the way traffic congestion is damaging the economic, social and environmental aspects of their lives.  This is also true of the greater Dublin area.  The traffic situation is untenable and getting worse by the day.  Action is demanded now, not in the timeframe outlined by the Minister for Public Enterprise in the Dáil last night.  Some of her proposals will not be in place by 2010.</P>
      <P>As an ardent believer in public transport, I was appalled when the Minister jettisoned the comprehensive on-street Luas proposals drawn up and approved by the previous Government.  Because of this decision, the light rail project has lost £114 million in Structural Funds.  Such a loss is galling when Ireland, and its eastern region in particular, needs huge transport investment.  The eastern region will lose out on the next <i>tranche</i> of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The LRT project was a Labour Party proposal and I was particularly pleased that I and my Labour Party colleagues, including then MEP Barry Desmond, made a detailed submission to Mr. Bruce Millan, the Commissioner for Regional Policies, on 1 October 1991.  Following detailed negotiations, we secured funding for this project. Is it any wonder then that I am furious at the possible loss of £114 million in funding for Dublin transport?</P>
      <P>Given that contracts must be signed by the end of 1999 to enable the drawing down of existing funding, it is imperative that proposals be drawn up with a view to going to contract for that date. Serious consideration must be given to doubling the railway track from Clonsilla to Maynooth, which would be of huge benefit to that catchment area, and the provision of additional diesel cars. New DART carriages are also required.  I have witnessed intolerable and potentially dangerous situations where commuters must stand on trains from Balbriggan to Dublin.  People are cramped like sardines on trains leaving Skerries, Donabate and Malahide.  The extension of the DART to Portmarnock and Malahide, which has been hugely successful in attracting people off the roads along the existing DART corridor, is promised for next year.  New buses and bus corridors are also necessary.  I blame the local authorities to some degree for not implementing the bus corridors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin is the only EU capital without a direct air link from its airport to the city, and it is predicted that 11.3 million passengers will use that airport this year.  The congestion for both travellers and workers endeavouring to access the airport <Col N="115" /> is intolerable and not in the interests of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>With up to 90 per cent of commuters using the roads in the city centre, we are left with continual gridlock, which has major economic and health implications.  The Minister is unable to give a timescale for a rail connection to the airport.  I propose a rail connection between the airport and the main Dublin-Belfast line.  That could be implemented in time to draw down the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>As a northside Deputy, I welcome the opportunity to speak.  When announcing her light rail plans last week, the Minister made great play of the fact that her version of light rail was an expanded project, that it included links to Dublin Airport, among other places, and that the northside of Dublin would get a light rail line as part of phase one.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister's claims do not stand up to scrutiny.  The prospect of light rail being extended to Dublin's northside has been further delayed as a result of her grand plan.  A northside light rail plan was an integral part of the original Luas plan, which the Minister scrapped.  There was a clear commitment to the planning and design stage of the northside line and this work was well under way.  In the past year, detailed evaluation and a certain amount of public consultation on the two possible northside routes took place.  This work, undertaken by CIE's project management team, has come to naught because of the Minister's obsession with building a tunnel in the city centre.</P>
      <P>That venture is fraught with technical difficulties and its feasibility remains in doubt.  What is not in doubt is the fact that the Minister's decision has further delayed construction of the northside line.  She admitted as much in the timetable attached to her press statement.  There is no clear route indicated in the Minister's proposals. No dates are given for a public inquiry into the northside route, for the beginning of construction of the route or for the route to become operational.  Behind the colourful maps and the Minister's fine words, the needs of Dublin's northside have again been put on the long finger.</P>
      <P>Given the absence of information on the northside route, the Minister should explain her plans in this regard.  What route is to be taken?  The Minister's plan was heavily influenced by the recent Progressive Democrats policy document on Dublin traffic.  Does she intend following the route outlined in that document, which proposes tunnelling underground from Liffey Junction, under Glasnevin Cemetery and the Botanic Gardens to Ballymun Road?  Does she intend boring tunnels under these highly sensitive areas?  Surely she does not propose the line goes overground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where will the line go?  My constituents deserve answers, and the Minister must outline her intentions.  It is also important for my constituents and for Dublin that the £114 million in EU funding previously earmarked for Luas, and <Col N="116" /> which will now not be spent on that project, should be ringfenced to implement other aspects of the DTI report.  At the Dublin city council meeting last Monday night I proposed a motion calling on the Government to ringfence that money for the Dublin area to improve public transport and relieve traffic congestion.  That motion was unanimously adopted by the council, including the 20 Fianna Fáil members and one PD member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister's preoccupation with tunnelling under the centre of Dublin was responsible for the loss of EU funding for the Luas project, there is a duty on her to ensure this money will be invested to address the urgent traffic problems facing our capital city.</P>
      <P>The public transport system in Dublin requires significant investment.  An expanded bus fleet and enhanced DART rolling stock are crucial to ensure the capacity problems currently turning commuters away from public transport are resolved.  The implementation of the 11 QBCs recommended by the DTI could be rapidly advanced by a substantial injection of capital. Environmental traffic cells in the city centre and enhanced traffic calming measures for our suburbs could also be radically improved if the funding were provided.</P>

      <P>Any member of the public who has to endure those conditions in Dublin would confirm the public transport system is completely inadequate.  All the £114 million should be committed to projects in the Dublin area.  That situation in Dublin which Dublin people and people from the rest of the country must endure on a daily basis can only be relieved in the short term if the Government is prepared to put the money where its mouth is and invest all the £114 million in transport and traffic proposals for the Dublin area.  I call on the Government to support our amendment.</P>

      <P>I support the thrust of Deputy Shortall's proposal that the money should be largely spent in the Dublin region.  That we do not have a rail link to Dublin Airport is a crying shame, but it is important that the Government is committed to providing one and to the regeneration of Ballymun.  That the spur to Finglas is also contemplated and existing, albeit disused, lines will be used is also welcome.  It is foolhardy and infantile for some people to criticise the project by saying it will involve digging under the graves in Glasnevin.  The graves in Glasnevin will not fall into the tunnel any more than the Harp Bar, as was suggested by some speakers last night.</P>
      <P>We need to address the problems of Dublin's traffic.  The QBCs need to be brought on stream. There needs to be proper traffic regulation enforcement and proper clamping.  The traffic warden service should be transferred to the remit of local authorities.  Those measures need to be implemented urgently and there needs to the political will to do that.  It is ridiculous that there is double and treble parking in the city.  A comprehensive plan has been proposed by the Government and I commend it.</P>

      <P>The contribution from Deputy Stagg on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last week could be described as hysterical.  Nobody has a monopoly of wisdom on this.  We should have a rational debate on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Labour Party Deputies is dogmatic and they will not facilitate a debate because they keep interrupting.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Government's decision on Luas.  This involves a surface line from Tallaght to Connolly Station and a line from Sandyford to Ballymun and Dublin Airport.  This decision was a brave one and takes the long-term view into account.  The Government has shown vision and I totally defend its right to take a political decision like this following consultation with a wide variety of interests.  I also welcome the fact that the Sandyford-Ballymun-Dublin Airport line will be underground from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone.  Total traffic chaos in O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, Lower Grafton Street and Dawson Street will be avoided and business in this area will not now be disrupted. That decision has been most welcomed by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very encouraged with the statement by <Col N="119" /> the Minister and the city manager's statement that the Tallaght-city centre and Sandyford-St. Stephen's Green lines will be constructed in the short term.  The city manager at a city council meeting last Monday night said this was a bigger and better scheme and he welcomed the fact that a decision had been made.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged that the technical planning of the northside line by the project team will commence immediately.  Three cheers for the northside of Dublin.  For too long, public policy makers &mdash; I include the Civil Service in this category &mdash; as well as opinion makers generally have been biased against that part of Dublin.  The line to Ballymun and the airport is now an integral part of this project and is no longer confined to never never land.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact we will have an integrated transport system.  I congratulate the Government on its decision to proceed with a number of road schemes.  I ask the Government to support the submission from Dublin Corporation to the effect that £114 million should be given to traffic projects in Dublin involving roads and traffic management, on which we all agree.  I call for a speedy implementation of the Government's action plan on traffic measures in Dublin together with the DTO strategy.</P>
    <P>It is now official Government policy that motorists should leave their cars at home when travelling to Dublin city centre.  Nothing more than a radical change of attitude is needed in this regard.  People talk about the chaotic traffic in</P>
    <P>Dublin but they do not realise they are causing it.  Motorists do not realise that it is public policy that they should not take their cars into the city centre, that cars should be taken off the road and that public transport, quality bus corridors and so on should be encouraged.  I welcome the measures brought forward by the DTO and look forward to the action plan from the Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome this courageous and astute plan.  As Deputy Haughey said, there is considerable traffic congestion in the city.  Sometimes it takes me an hour and a quarter to get here from my home six miles away.  It is time something was done about it and this is a good start.  The Government was anxious to ensure Dublin got a light rail system which met its long-term rather than short-term transport requirements.  It is not something into which we should rush.  If we are to do it properly, we must look at all aspects.</P>

      <P>The underground option for the city centre removes the concerns about the capacity of the on street system to meet the long-term passenger demand, particularly in the light of the recent high economic growth and trends indicating that further growth is likely.</P>
      <P>The underground route was identified and selected in the Atkins report and influenced the Government's decision.  Significant traffic disruption would occur on key routes along Lower O'Connell Street, Westmoreland Street, lower Grafton Street, Nassau Street and Dawson Street. By using an underground section along this line and Broadstone as the site from which most of the tunnelling work will be done, the major disadvantage of the on street proposal will be avoided.</P>
      <P>I welcome the widespread support the Government's plan has received, in particular the call to action by those who may not fully agree with it. The mood among the public is that there has been enough talking, that we should get on with the project and that it should not be opposed for the sake of doing so.  There has been much talk about whether it should go underground or overground.  Let us talk about what it will do for the citizens of Dublin and for future generations. That is what is important, not coming into the House to take cheap shots and joke about it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue as somebody who has fought and campaigned for an integrated public transport system since I was first elected to Dublin City Council.  I congratulate the Minister on this brave decision because she and the Government knew that once they changed the previous decision they would face much opposition.  I have no doubt that in 20 years' time, people will look back and say it was the right decision.  Many members of the Opposition know that.</P>
      <P>It is strange that the Labour Party, which was a junior member in Government, is saying there is something wrong with the Progressive Democrats, the junior members of this Government, having an influence on policy.  What is wrong with that?  It is a good decision and if it had an influence on it, good for it.  There is nothing wrong with the Progressive Democrats or any small party having an input into Government policy. That is the reason they are in Government.</P>
      <P>The Government outlined a definitive programme and has given overall direction to the plan for the development not only of Luas but of public transport in Dublin.  The decision to develop the north-south, Ballymun to Sandyford, and the east-west, Tallaght to Connolly Station, routes acts as a major impetus to public transport in this city by adding four new rail based corridors to the network.  Atkins stated that each of these lines will carry the same number of passengers as the DART.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate implementation of the Tallaght to Connolly Station line means it will be in operation <Col N="121" /> by 2002 which was the original plan for the Tallaght to city centre line, as outlined by CIE. The implementation of the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line will follow shortly afterwards. What is agreed by all is that Luas is one part only of an overall traffic and public transport strategy for the city.  The Government's decision has given the Dublin Transport Initiative strategy a major boost and has set the scene for Dublin Corporation to press ahead with the implementation of the traffic cells and quality bus corridors.  As a party, we have always been committed to the link to the airport.  This plan has put in place the process to provide such an adequate transport connection.</P>
    <P>This visionary transport plan has divided the Opposition.  Deputy Jim Mitchell seems to agree with the Government because he knows it is a good plan.  Deputy Quinn, the Leader of the Labour Party, had to reel in Deputy Stagg as his spokesman on public transport because he knows northside Labour Deputies want this plan.  I do not understand why they seem to be so much against it.</P>
    <P>The Opposition knows it is a better plan than that proposed by the last Government.  Where was the extension to Connolly Station and the commitment to providing a service to the airport? It did much talking about a fully integrated transport system but little was done about it.  The time for talking is over and the time for action and implementation is now.  By clearing the way and extending the original plan, it is possible to advance the public consultation on the Ballymun-airport line to take place early in the autumn.  The light rail system will be a basic part of the regeneration and reconstruction of Ballymun and the northside of Dublin.  Similarly, the decision to extend to Connolly Station and continue into the Dublin docklands area ensures that a new transport infrastructure will be put in place while the major development of the docks occurs.</P>
    <P>The phasing of the overall plan will predict the immediate implementation of the system and afford the opportunity to extend the system to Clondalkin, Swords and Cabinteely.  This is a good plan and I have no doubt that in 20 years' time people will see it as a good decision.</P>

      <P>I was horrified by the Opposition's negative reaction to the Government's announcement last week.  It has tried to turn it into an art form.  The Government has made a decision.  Why all this mindless negative slagging? One wonders if the Opposition is interested in putting what is good for the city first or if it is a case of trying to make political capital.  We are all frustrated by the delays and problems.  I was on the DTA in the 1980s, the DTI in the 1990s and now the DTO.</P>

      <P>I spent ten to 12 years of my life talking about traffic and major schemes to tackle it.  We all hope to see the day when people are out with drills or bulldozers working on Luas or the port tunnel.  We have become almost too democratic and there is almost too much consultation.  We all want action, and action will be taken if all of us do something to bring it about rather than agree with every group that puts forward objections.</P>
      <P>This is not a simple decision.  When we get down to the nitty gritty of putting tracks underground many problems will arise.  I do not know much about tunnelling, but presumably rather than dig straight down one would have to dig at a slope.  In order to dig under city centre buildings one might have to go back 500 or 600 yards. Regardless of what infrastructure is envisaged many problems will arise before the job is complete.  There must be some pain if we are to have good, viable long-term infrastructure that benefits all of us.</P>
      <P>Many crocodile tears are shed about city traffic and blame is put on the Government of the day, the DTO or the city manager.  The people who cause the traffic jams, however, are ourselves and we are not prepared to accept that.  We all want the other person to leave his car at home and use public transport.  Much good work is being done at present, even if it is slow to come to fruition. We all agree in theory with quality bus corridors, but some of the people who support them &mdash; I have witnessed this on the city council &mdash; object when one is planned because they want to protect a local shop.  We must consider the overall picture rather than object to everything that is proposed because somebody is unhappy about it.  If that is the way we proceed we will never get anything done.  Similar problems will arise when the detailed planning of the underground system is put forward.  We cannot all be winners and we must face up to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DTO and local authorities should make the best use of the present road space.  I recall a recent city council meeting at which peak-time traffic problems were discussed.  Many employees operate flexitime which is of benefit in terms of easing traffic jams, but one of the major contributors to city traffic is school transport.  There is a huge difference in the amount of traffic on a school day compared with a non-school day.  If we want to solve some of the traffic problems we should consider changing school starting time to an hour earlier or an hour later.  School should not be considered as a glorified child-minding service, with everybody leaving their children to school at the same time on the way to work.  On school holidays there is much less traffic on the streets.  It is not necessary for 50 per cent of people to leave their cars at home.  If 5 or 6 per cent of people transferred to public transport it would make a huge difference.  There are some issues such as this which we are not prepared to tackle.  Regardless of what party is in power we should face up to those issues.  This matter should <Col N="123" /> be considered in an overall manner and improvements made that benefit the city as a whole.</P>
    <P>I agree with speakers who referred to the £140 million that will be diverted to other projects.  I am sure every politician will have plans for their constituencies, but since this money was earmarked for Dublin much of it should be spent on the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>All of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>All of it if possible, but I am not greedy.  I would be happy if a sizeable portion of it was spent on Dublin.  I heard Deputy Sean Ryan speak earlier about bus coaches and carriages.  It does not matter whether the money is spent on public transport or roads or a combination of both.  I do not know if the Minister for Public Enterprise will keep the money or if it will go back to the Department of Finance, but there are many projects that could be speeded up, either under the Department of Public Enterprise or the Department of the Environment and Local Government, with that money.  There are plans for a new bridge over the Liffey near Macken Street which would probably be of greater benefit to the city than some of the projects that would cost much more.  Most of the money should be spent in Dublin because that is where most problems are experienced.  We must make full use of the road space that is available.</P>
      <P>Some people object to quality bus corridors because motorists are not allowed stop in the morning outside newsagents shops to buy newspapers and cigarettes, yet if we are to spend so much money there will be no choice.  Nobody will be allowed park in those areas.  Why must we spend £200 million or £400 million to get the message through that parking is not allowed outside newsagents in the morning?  It should not be necessary to spend that amount of money.  All parties should work together to get the message across to people that everybody cannot be winners.  Some people will lose, and if some businesses do not fare as well as they did previously that will have to be considered.</P>
      <P>I worked in CIE for 25 years and bus transport does not have the upmarket image that the DART enjoys.  We must change the image of bus transport so that a greater number of people will use buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if necessary.  Much of the criticism of bus transport is not deserved.  Bus transport is as good as any other service.  There is a perception that it is not as good, that drivers are grumpy and so on, but that is not true and we must get rid of that perception.  We discussed a second Finance Bill today and it is unlikely there will be a third one, but some innovative measure should be introduced for employers to give weekly or monthly bus tickets <Col N="124" /> to their staff or sell tickets to them on a tax free basis.  There must be positive intervention to encourage people to leave their cars at home and use public transport.</P>
      <P>The DTI was considered an overall integrated plan, but the proposed new underground system is much better than the previous proposal in that it would link into existing infrastructure.  As well as this measure and the quality bus corridors, we must consider other measures to encourage people to use public transport.  Something must be done about the thousands of private car parking spaces in the city.  Some charge must be levied through benefit-in-kind or otherwise.  Many people who bring their cars into the city do not need them during the day.  They use them only to travel to and from work.  Most public representatives would say that we need our cars to go to constituency meetings and so on and that there should be an exception for us.  There should be an exception for many people who need their cars during the day, but those who do not need them should be given some incentive to leave them at home.  A penalty on them would direct a small percentage of them from their cars into public transport.</P>
      <P>Overall, I welcome the proposals on the underground.  I look forward to the day the work starts. I hope we can all combine to make that day as soon as possible.  In the long-term this proposal will be seen to have been right and, for once, politicians will be congratulated for taking a long-term view.</P>

      <P>The saga of the promised light rail system for Dublin is beginning to appear like that of the draining of the Shannon.  For several decades there were repeated announcements at election times that the Shannon would be drained.  As we know that never happened.  The same will be the case with the light rail plan for Dublin.  It has been talked about for more than a decade.  In 1991 a Fianna Fáil election manifesto promised a feasibility study for a light rail system on the former Harcourt Street line and a possible rail link to Dublin Airport.  The previous three Governments have discussed the proposal and announced various decisions, yet we have not seen a single tram.  The prospect of seeing a Dublin light rail system has faded further into the distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cabinet's decision to reject the advice of the independent consultants to proceed with the proposals agreed by the rainbow Government was a disaster.  Had the Minister's plan been devised and launched ten or 15 years ago it might have been a sensible way to proceed.  However, the traffic in Dublin city and county has deteriorated <Col N="125" /> in the interim to such an extent that the priority must be to get a satisfactory public system up and running without further delay.</P>
    <P>The plans approved by the rainbow Government would have ensured and provided for the extension of the system to Ballymun and the airport.  The Minister has taken a leap in the dark with her proposals.  She is unable to say how much the project will cost, she can only estimate the starting date and can only hazard a guess at possible completion dates.  The necessary preliminary work to justify the decision to go underground has not been done.  We do not know what geological or hydrological problems will arise.  We do not know what problems will be faced with regard to historic buildings or sites of archaeological interest.  We do not know what legal problems will arise, although we should know from previous experiences that the legal challenges will be many and prolonged.</P>
    <P>If the project ever goes ahead the impression given by some that staying overground would create major traffic disruption while going underground will create virtually no disruption will prove to be a myth.  I was interested by a number of points made by former Minister, Deputy Lowry, in his contribution yesterday to which the Minister did not respond and which received little attention.  He said that he was informed by technical staff in the Department that each underground station would cost at least £30 million and in construction terms each station would be the equivalent of putting Liberty Hall on its side underground.  If the underground line goes from Harcourt Street to Broadstone a minimum of six underground stations will be required to give adequate coverage.  That alone would cost about £200 million and the disruption likely to be caused by building six horizontal Liberty Halls under the city centre is frightening.</P>
    <P>What is more, the £30 million cost of each such station would be sufficient to replace the dilapidated vehicles of the Dublin Bus fleet.  Given the doubt and uncertainty surrounding the Luas project the immediate priority must be to improve radically other public transport services in Dublin.  Despite many requests to do so neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister has been willing to give a commitment that the £114 million of EU funds which had been earmarked for the Luas project will be retained to improve public transport in Dublin.  Calls to divert the money to finance the pet projects of particular Ministers from outside Dublin must be resisted.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has been dithering, commissioning consultants' reports which she ignores, changing her mind, fighting internal battles at Cabinet, holding press conferences and publishing grand plans, Dublin has been grinding to a halt gradually.  Week by week the situation worsens.  Traffic conditions which were the norm for an hour at peak times in the morning and evening are now experienced throughout the day.  Relatively short journeys at peak times take on epic proportions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> There are public transport projects on which the £114 million could usefully be spent.  There is a need to upgrade the Dublin to Maynooth line to service the growing population in the areas along it, there is scope for improvement in DART services and the building of quality bus corridors must be accelerated.  There is also a need to increase substantially the public subvention for Dublin Bus.  Bus services will remain the only public transport option for the vast majority of Dubliners for the foreseeable future.  Contrary to public perception the level of subvention for Dublin Bus at 3.8p per passenger journey remains among the lowest for any similar sized city in Europe.</P>
    <P>The combination of poor service, relatively high fares and chronic traffic problems is forcing more people away from public transport and into their cars.  This is worsening the traffic problem, further slowing down the buses and particularly inconveniencing people who have no alternative to public transport.  The pricing and ticketing policy of Dublin Bus must also be examined.  This is an integral part of the solution to Dublin's traffic problems.  The introduction of one person operated buses has significantly slowed down the buses and contributed to the worsening traffic situation.  This has been so because many people pay in cash as they board the buses leading to long delays at bus stops and consequent blockages in the traffic flow.</P>
    <P>When one person buses were first introduced Dublin Bus launched a series of multi-journey tickets which offered commuters a real financial incentive to buy them.  For example, a ten journey ticket for a £1 fare cost £8.  However, instead of promoting these tickets Dublin Bus has departed from their use and there is no economic benefit to buying them.  The ticketing policy needs to be reversed.</P>
    <P>The social and economic costs of crawling traffic and congested streets are well known.  The solution requires an efficient public transport system with economic fares.  This cannot be provided on the level of subvention currently provided to Dublin Bus.  The £114 million earmarked for the Luas project should be allocated to address immediately the public transport problem in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Minister is proving to be the emperor with no clothes.  She should be going underground in shame rather than suggest that the light rail project should be delayed for a further three years so that it can go underground. The Minister took office saying that she was unwilling to go ahead with a project that was in the starting trap.  She wanted to have it carefully examined and get expert opinions.  She was going to ensure that EU funding for the project would not be jeopardised.  She declared this openly and repeatedly.  After a ten month delay the Atkins report was produced and it recommended clearly the best underground option and assessed its merit against the surface option.  In both cases the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> Government has rejected the experts' advice.  It has selected the inferior of the underground options and rejected the advice that a surface system would be best.  It was a con job to say that experts would guide the decision.  It was always going to be a political choice and the Government has made a hash of it.</P>
    <P>No analysis has been given by the Government for its decision.  There have been years' worth of reports examining traffic flows and passenger numbers but the Government has made its decision without any such justification.  What did the best underground option offer in comparison to the surface option?</P>
    <P>It offered higher operating costs, six million fewer passengers, £100 million extra in capital investment, and additional commercial loss, discounted at the present time, of £276 million &mdash; a massive additional cost with fewer passengers. That was the best underground option, but the Government chose one that was worse than that. The only merit in an underground option is that it should reduce congestion overhead, but the key reason the consultants rejected the option we now see the Government adopting was that it would not reduce congestion overground.</P>
    <P>The final ignominy from the Minister's point of view was that she tried to con this House and the public by saying she could implement a plan for the whole city, north and south, for £400 million plus.  Everyone was mystified as to how that could be done.  The consultants said the basic project would cost £263 million, that there would be an extra £100 million for an underground, or £50 million if we give the Government the benefit of the doubt because only half as much was being put underground, and that it would cost £252 million to provide the extensions.  That adds up to a minimum of £550 million, but the Government said it would cost much less.  It would still have to pay for rolling stock.  How was it to be done?  The answer we got last night was that it would not be done.  The Government made no commitment to include the north side.  It remains relegated to the third phase which will be pushed out well into the second decade of the next century.  The Government tried to curry favour with the people of the north side by telling them they were included.  They now see they were had.</P>
    <P>On tunnelling, I have no objection to the Government deciding on some underground options as a way of easing city traffic.  However, a light railway system should not be put underground; cars should be put underground.  A system that has problems with gradients should not be forced underground, where there has to be a long run-in, where stations have to be constructed underground at enormous cost and where there is difficulty coming back out of the tunnel.  For reasons of cost as well as for social reasons, it is inappropriate to put public transport underground.  It is wrong to force traffic and pedestrians to share limited space overground and force public transport underground.  Public transport <Col N="128" /> and pedestrians should have the benefit of the sunshine and the opportunity to look at their city.  We should put cars underground if an underground is required.  It could be done at less cost, and cars are more suited to negotiating underground.</P>
    <P>I am mystified as to why the Government made its decision.  It has jeopardised £114 million towards addressing Dublin's transport problems. By its own admission it has pushed back solutions by a minimum of three years, and it has tried to con the people into thinking that in some way this is a more integrated and inclusive project.  We found out, sadly, that there is no commitment to that.  As far as Dubliners are concerned this will be seen as one of the most serious decisions by the Government, not only because the merits of it were wrong but, more important, because it is becoming clearer every day that no thinking went into the decision and that the Government tried, when it made its announcement, to conceal what it was doing with all sorts of glossy frills which are falling away day by day.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy Yates's initiative in tabling this motion of condemnation of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Traffic growth within the capital is such that immediate solutions must be sought and any prospect of delay in the creation of new light rail services must be rejected.  Infrastructure which will have longevity must be put in place.</P>
      <P>The difficulty that ordinary people are experiencing is set to increase rapidly in the immediate years ahead.  The decision to put the system underground must not be allowed to be the cause of further hardship for the workers and commuters of Dublin, but delays in the provision of this service will occur owing to the decision of this Government.  We need a medium-term improvement in the transportation methods which are used to serve the capital city while we wait for the promised light rail service to become a fact.</P>
      <P>There is no rationale to the Cabinet's decision to put the service underground in the city centre. The impact on the commercial sector has not yet been adequately assessed.  When one considers the financial strain placed on the business community when even short-term projects are in progress it becomes obvious that a real and complex compensation scheme will be required to meet the traders' immediate losses and losses which they may or may not suffer in re-establishing their trade or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No consideration appears to have been given to the loss of revenue from the tourism sector as areas of historic importance are interfered with and, in some cases, damaged.  The impact of any construction work undertaken must be minimised.  Plans must be developed to ameliorate the negative impact on the city and its people.  There must be maximum use of street traffic space.  That means that supports must be put in place.  We have to be radical and immediate in the manner <Col N="129" /> in which we promote the transfer of commuters to public transport.</P>
    <P>While accepting that a light rail scheme, in some form, must be the central plank of the long-term conversion to a freer-running city, we have to take action to encourage people to use public transport now.  Only in this way will we be able to keep some level of control on the city during the long periods of disruption which the Government now proposes to impose on the community. How to maximise the current services is a question which must be asked.  There must be additional facilities along the existing DART and rail routes if people are to use those transport systems.  The provision of a new DART station at Grange Road, Baldoyle, beside the bridge, is a necessity.  In the growing areas of Donaghmede, Claremanor, Grange Abbey and Baldoyle itself, many motorists could be encouraged off the road, helping to ease traffic congestion, if this station were built.  I am equally sure that there would be a considerable increase in usage in other areas if a similar option were provided.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the long-term transportation development will be park and ride facilities.  The structure to support this must be put in place now.  Such a development, if correctly managed and marketed, could reduce private car use considerably.  The argument that insufficient public transport vehicles are available to support the scheme is not good enough.  There are considerable reserves of coaches within the private sector to meet the demands which this move would generate.  Land banks are readily available to be converted into parking areas suitably located on the outer fringes of the city.  The cost of establishing these changes should be borne within the overall cost of the Luas project.  Light rail schemes, whether underground or overground, which will not be delivered for years are not of much use to a city which is daily crawling towards paralysis.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to clearly detail how it intends to fund the project while it runs the risk of losing European funding is also unacceptable not only to Dubliners but to every right thinking Irish person.  The switchback railway approach of the Minister on this issue is regrettable.  She appears to have lost her way along the route.  Reports that the Cabinet is all over the place do not boost confidence.  This Government has many questions to answer.  That same Government has to sort itself out and put in place the means to address the traffic gridlock which daily builds in the city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I speak as one of the Members of Dáil Éireann who does not drive a car.  Therefore, I am an expert on trying to get from A to B on public transport.  I know why people have to use their cars.  Public transport in Dublin is so clogged up and erratic that it is not an alternative, much less something that offers a better choice.  That is why people are disappointed, appalled and cynical about the decision taken after many expensive, time consuming consultants' reports.  There <Col N="130" /> is gridlock on the streets of Dublin and people believed progress and a freeing up of traffic would begin before the end of this year, 2002 was a bright, gleaming vision where we would come through whatever disruption was required and have a clean, direct, well regulated and effective public transport system to compensate for the frustration and loss of time and money.</P>

They will find we are reflecting the disappointment and depression people are feeling with regard to the never never plan that has been offered.  It has not been properly integrated or costed and offers us an underground system, which in theory has a great deal to commend it, but in reality is a nightmare.  Apart from the cost and length of time involved, there will be problems tunnelling in such an ancient city because there are no geological surveys to decide or even indicate what is involved.  Whatever we believe is involved will be much worse and almost impossible as well as time consuming and costly.  Many people do not see that as an option, especially when the sheer logistics of the plan are considered.</P>
      <P>I refer to off peak times in underground stations in other cities around the world.  Women will not use them because the lack of security and danger is such that they do not feel safe.  That should have been considered and there also has been no commitment regarding what we can salvage from this botched plan and selling out the expectations of the people not just of Dublin, but nationwide.  We are not just talking about urban dwellers in Dublin who want traffic alleviated. Hundreds of thousands of people throughout Ireland depend on travelling through Dublin to allow them to continue their work.  This is not a selfish scheme in the hinterland of Dublin; it concerns the lifeblood of the country and the investment and industry in it.  We will pay a high cost with regard to people thinking seriously about investing further in this country if the transport difficulties are not quickly attended to.</P>
      <P>We already know from surveys that traffic has become the number one crisis for people in Dublin and those travelling to the city.  Many people from the country who wish to visit Dublin and have a pleasant time will not come near it at this stage.  The entire population is denied as a result of the messing in Dublin.</P>
      <P>People are disappointed and disillusioned because of the new plan which has been foisted on them, as Deputy Bruton said and even the underground element, which is unfeasible and unrealistic means the best option has not been taken up by the Minister.  There has been no explanation from her or any other member of Government as to whether any of the plans and changes she made are valid.  As elected Members we deserved that because answers should be provided regarding the consultation and cost involved and she has not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> The Minister has not made a commitment regarding the sum of £114 million which is not going into the system and it may not be used exclusively for that which it was intended initially &mdash; the traffic of Dublin &mdash; and this fills everyone with suspicion.  Unless and until the Minister gives a commitment that every penny of that money will go to alternative or support systems to ameliorate public transport immediately there will be an outcry, particularly in Dublin.  The needs for that money are huge and many Deputies referred to them earlier.</P>
    <P>I refer to quality bus corridors.  For example, last Monday I stood outside Dún Laoghaire Community College and waited half an hour for a bus home.  Fortunately, I did not have an appointment but people with business appointments and a heavy work schedule cannot wait that long. When a bus arrived eventually it was so old that, as we chugged up each hill, I expected it to slide back down again.  Deputy Ahern referred to the DART having a certain status.  Until the quality of buses is improved, snobbery or status will not keep people away from them, but sheer survival will.  We must ensure they are attractive and are given priority within the transport system.  As a commuter, I will be glad to use them if they are effective.  This money must be committed immediately to updating the bus system.</P>
    <P>I am privileged to be on the DART line but more seats are being removed on a weekly basis so that people can stand.  However, the difficulty is this increases congestion and people pass out because there are not enough carriages.  A mobile Garda task force is needed to ensure the flow of traffic.  It would be of comfort to people to see a botched plan being replaced by one that had been consulted on, agreed and anticipated by 2002. When during the next millennium can we expect this great plan to finish?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the contributions to the debate.  The widespread agreement on the need to improve traffic congestion in Dublin is obvious.  All Deputies acknowledged that a variety of measures are needed to achieve this and that while light rail is vital, it is only one element in a comprehensive and integrated approach to addressing Dublin's transport problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has addressed this problem by renewing its commitment to the implementation of the current DTO transport strategy.  The Government's decision on the light rail project also gave the go-ahead for three road projects identified as essential for effective traffic management in the city, involving a total expenditure of about £30 million.  It will also give urgent consideration to the action plan being finalised by the Dublin Transportation Office to address the growing transportation deficit arising from the unprecedented level of traffic growth in recent years.  That plan will propose short-term <Col N="132" /> measures which can be taken over the next two years to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>The Government has also approved a comprehensive plan for light rail.  Before making its decision it gave long and serious consideration to the issues set out in the Atkins report.  This plainly spelt out the facts on matters such as disruption during construction, long-term passenger capacity of the system and the impact of light rail operations on the traffic system generally.  Many of the restricting factors of a full on-street system, including capacity problems identified by Atkins, will now be overcome by providing the short tunnel from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone.  The proposed short underground section will also address many of the concerns about disruption during construction.</P>
    <P>What we now need, as the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, stated in the House last night, is to focus all our energies and considerable skills on delivering the light rail network to the citizens of Dublin without delay.  There is widespread support for the Government's plan, which I welcome. The Government's objective, subject to the relevant statutory procedures and the necessary detailed technical confirmation, is to proceed without delay with the construction of the Tallaght to city centre and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections.  This will make use of most of the work done to date by CIE.  Based on discussions which have already taken place with the company, applications for light railway orders can be submitted for the Tallaght to Abbey Street and the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, work was already under way on the selection of possible surface route alignments for the line to Ballymun.  This will be completed without delay and will take account of the continuation of the line to Dublin Airport.  The project team hope to begin public consultation on possible route options this autumn.  Further work, including a detailed technical evaluation, is needed on the underground section. This will proceed in parallel with the work on the Tallaght to Connolly Station and Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green sections.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision will deliver an integrated system which will finally provide a direct link between Heuston and Connolly stations and a direct interchange between light rail, DART and suburban rail systems at Connolly Station. Dublin airport and provincial bus services at Busaras will also be directly served by the new light rail network.  Funding will be provided to deliver on the Government's commitment to the project. It is also the Government's intention to submit the project for the next round of EU funding.</P>
    <P>A sensible and prudent decision has been taken to decommit EU funding from the project in the current round.  The Minister for Public Enterprise will work to ensure a reasonable proportion of the EU funds not used for Luas will be reallocated to address public transport requirements. The Government has taken a realistic and farsighted <Col N="133" /> decision to deal with the major issues of capacity and disruption in the city of Dublin.  It has also set out a clear strategy for making parallel progress on the various elements of the project, with a clear objective of starting construction early in 2000.</P>
    <P>We should now get on with the job of delivering a quality transport system to the citizens of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this debate and congratulate Deputy Yates and his team on being the only Opposition party to produce a comprehensive plan since going into Opposition.  I encourage other Opposition parties to produce similar documents.</P>
      <P>This is a political issue because my constituents in Dublin South-West are frustrated by the Government's actions.  There is a sense of disbelief that the project will ever get off the ground. If the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, had not come into office, we could have started building the Tallaght line into the city centre this year.  There is a complete sense of shock and disbelief in the Tallaght community at the Government's actions. Nobody inside or outside the House believes the Government when it says it is committed to the plan.  It could have been delivered by the year 2002 if the political will was there to make it happen.  The political will to do that does not exist.</P>
      <P>It was decided not to proceed with the tunnel option so that more funds could be provided for the suburbs.  The objective of the transport bible from which we are all quoting, the original DTI, was to ensure the new suburbs and the west and south west of the city would be given a decent public transport system.  However, because the Government has committed more money for an underground route, west Tallaght, where the rate of car ownership is lower than anywhere else in the country, will not get a proper transport system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Minister gave way to the vested interests in the city because some years ago she had the courage to take on the fuel lobby and won the debate for the people of Dublin.  However, in this case, city centre traders won out against the people in the new suburbs in my constituency.  What influence have the vested interests in the city that allowed them win the debate?  The money that was supposed to provide a decent public transport system for people in the suburbs has been lost forever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the next local elections we will ensure Government parties suffer at the hands of the <Col N="134" /> electorate in Dublin.  The Minister will not be allowed to forget this.  Once again in the tradition of Fianna Fáil, as Todd Andrews or Kevin Boland destroyed our city in the l950s and l960s, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has destroyed a public transport opportunity for Dublin in the l990s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The promises made by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in successive elections during the l980s and l990s, and constantly repeated in Dublin South, to reopen the Harcourt Street line are now of equal status in Irish political mythology and folklore, to promises made in earlier decades to drain the River Shannon.  As traffic gridlock extends throughout the Dublin South constituency, the issue is not whether Luas should go underground or overground, but whether the Government has a credible commitment to the provision of a light rail system or whether there is reason to believe the parties in Government will live up to their promises.  The Luas indicative timetable announced by the Minister last night lacks credibility.  There is minimal possibility that it will be remotely adhered to.</P>
      <P>Prior to the last election Deputies Brennan, Kitt and O'Donnell stated their individual parties' commitment to Luas.  As recently as three weeks ago the Government Chief Whip, Deputy Brennan, at a meeting with Dundrum Chamber of Commerce, gave assurances that Luas would proceed without delay and indicated that the Government was likely to implement the overground option.  Those three Deputies grievously misled the electorate in Dublin South as to the nature of their commitment.  It is time they and other Government Ministers admitted the announced extended and enhanced project is nothing more than a smokescreen designed to deflect criticism from the Government's intention to abandon the project.  This Government, and the three Ministers representing my constituency, have betrayed the electorate and abandoned any attempt to resolve the traffic problems experienced on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>In this context it is also worth noting that since taking office the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has had before him the inspector's report into the inquiry into the construction of the Dundrum bypass and the Ballinteer Road-Wyckham Park bypass.  There is no justification for having failed to date to make the orders necessary to allow these essential projects to be undertaken.  This failure, together with the Government decision on Luas, shows a contemptuous disregard for the daily traffic problems experienced by all those who live in south Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days there have been various media reports about what might happen to the public inquiry into Luas which is to reconvene on 4 June.  When making its announcement last week the Government gave no consideration to this issue.  Last night the Minister told the House that, having taken legal advice, the Luas project team was of the view that the existing applications for <Col N="135" /> light railway orders should be withdrawn and new ones submitted.  It is astonishing that prior to last week's announcement the Government did not seek legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on this issue, and apparently it has still not done so.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to come to terms with the fact that pursuant to section 8 of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, Judge O'Leary is obliged in law to hold an inquiry into the original Luas scheme in relation to which CIE applied to the Government one year ago for a light railway order.  It is that proposed scheme which must be central to the inquiry and the report which he is required by statute to prepare and submit to the Minister.  There is no specific provision in the 1996 Act for the withdrawal of an application previously made by CIE for a light railway order after the appointment of a person under the Act to hold the statutorily prescribed inquiry.  Judge O'Leary could quite properly decide to proceed with the inquiry, as he is required by section 8 of the legislation to be &ldquo;independent in the performance of his functions&rdquo; and could be regarded as in breach of this statutory obligation if he unduly delays the hearing over which he has been appointed to preside.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about the new Luas proposal and is not merely playing political games, new legislation is required to determine what should happen to the public inquiry now properly ordered and scheduled to take place.  At this point it appears the Government has abdicated its responsibility to provide for this new legislation and is leaving future developments in the hands of Judge O'Leary.  This is particularly inappropriate because, as the Minister finally acknowledged last night, if the Government intends to proceed with the new proposed light rail system CIE will have to make new applications under the 1996 Act for new light railway orders, a new public inquiry would have to be called and a qualified person under the terms of the Act appointed to preside over it, and a new environmental impact statement would be required.  Under the Act the current inquiry cannot simply be adjourned or put into abeyance while these issues are addressed.  Such an approach is fatally flawed and would inevitably result in any subsequent light rail orders made by Government being struck down as invalid by the courts.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to this issue in recent weeks is unprecedented in the context of a public inquiry already ordered under statute.  It can be regarded as an attack on the independent role of the judge appointed to conduct the inquiry and as intended to undermine his statutory independence.  Interestingly, section 21 of the Act states that a person who obstructs, interferes with or assists someone to obstruct or interfere with anyone in the performance of a function conferred on him or her by this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction <Col N="136" /> to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both. The Minister for Public Enterprise and each member of the Government can be properly regarded as having obstructed, interfered with or having attempted to obstruct or interfere with the performance by Judge O'Leary of his statutory duty with regard to the inquiry, and with the functions of the CIE board as conferred by the Act.  I presume it is too much to ask that the behaviour of the Minister and members of the Government be investigated in this context and papers referred to the DPP with a view to ascertaining whether the appropriate prosecutions should be brought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  The Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Green Party, who did not get an opportunity to speak support the motion and we support the Labour party amendment which provides that the £114 million should be allocated for public transport purposes in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech should be carefully preserved by all Dublin Deputies because it will form the basis of her political epitaph.  I always knew she had the capacity blithely to ignore criticism but her brazen hard neck became apparent last night when she said that all criticism of her decision to scrap the existing blueprint would be deflected by the knowledge that she had opted for a bigger and better plan.  However, she admitted that the formal Government decision did not include the extensions to Swords, the docklands, Cabinteely and Clondalkin, and that the spur to Finglas is the subject of a feasibility study.  This means her great selling point &mdash; that this was a massive new proposal for the northside &mdash; is not even part of the formal Government decision.</P>
      <P>The debate has given us some idea of the tunnel, more properly called a black hole.  In fun park terms, I cannot decide whether this will be a ghost train in the dark or a roller coaster ride. First there will be 130 boreholes, then there is the risk of subsidence.  One geology professor said there was a risk of drilling into a water main. When we reach a certain level professors of archaeology may say there is a need for special preservation along the lines of Wood Quay. Engineering analysts now tell us that, because of the differences in depth combined with the short length, passengers will have to wear seat belts to cope with the sharp ascent and descent of the tunnel through the city's sedimentary rock base while avoiding the seven underground rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is lunacy, a black hole from which there will be no escape in cost terms.  The port tunnel cost three times what was projected and the Channel tunnel, from an initial estimate of £500 million, ended up costing £9 billion.  This is not proper procedure, it is Government without analysis which is ignoring expert reports.  The Minister and the Government neglected to tell the truth and misled the House about the basis of <Col N="137" /> the delay.  Only the Atkins report prevented the Government from having the public inquiry into the Tallaght and Dundrum lines concluded by now.  That report clearly stated that its favoured conclusion, taking all factors into account, was an overground option.  As to the public inquiry, the eminent legal advice of Deputy Shatter and many others is that the original legislation which set up the Luas inquiry never envisaged a piecemeal approach of one route and one public inquiry at a time.  We will need new legislation and must return to the drawing board.</P>
    <P>Government backbench Deputies lamely limped into the House to say there was something in this proposal for the northside.  The Minister's timetable, circulated with her script, did not mention either Ballymun or the Airport, let alone the extensions which she shelved and which were not part of the formal Government decision.  The Ballymun route is further away under this proposal than it was previously and people on the northside have been sold a pup in this spectacular charade.</P>
    <P>In the process we have lost the European funding.  As a former office holder I know the Department of Finance will fight a rearguard action every year through the public capital programme; it will misinterpret and re-interpret the decision into an extremely long-term proposal.  All the while, 60,000 new cars are registered in the greater Dublin area each year.</P>
    <P>We have abandoned ten years of analysis, painstaking scrutiny and detailed design, culminating in a public inquiry to allow the tenders be sent out for the construction of something that will give imminent relief to the people of Tallaght and commuters travelling in from Dundrum.  We have ended up with a pipe dream which will never see the light of day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Chair has given me the opportunity to raise this matter which I hope will not be regarded as too parochial.  I ask the appropriate Minister to introduce a programme to discriminate in favour of inland swimming pools given that many people have no alternative but to use local pools.  I understand that <Col N="143" /> in the midland counties of Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois there are ten voluntary run pools, of which four have received grants over the years, five have grant applications pending and one is being run without the assistance of State funding.  Many of these pools have fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years and the local authorities and voluntary organisations concerned are unable to provide the necessary funding to finance the appropriate refurbishment works.  They are operating on a shoestring budget.  Money has to be raised by flag days, cake sales, church gate collections and so on.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to co-ordinate the operations of inland swimming pools under the aegis of one Department, preferably the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation rather than the Department of the Environment and Local Government, and introduce a five year action programme with priority being given to pools in the midlands.  It is less than acceptable that spanking new pools can be provided at a cost of in excess of £1 million in major centres of population within easy reach of the sea while the run down pools in the midland counties mentioned, located at least one hour's drive from the nearest seaside resort and coastal towns, remain closed for most of the year leaving young people in particular without swimming facilities.  It is only fair that major centres of population in the midlands should be given priority in terms of swimming pool development. It is unjust that hundreds of thousands of pounds from the national lottery and the public purse are expended year after year on facilities for people who live within walking distance of the sea.</P>
      <P>The midlands regions have suffered in more ways than one.  They have never been properly identified as separate regions.  The appropriate Department should consider the swimming pool facilities in Counties Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois and ensure that the people of those areas are not disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Flanagan a d'ardaigh an cheist seo.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this matter.  I understand his interest because he did much competitive swimming when he was younger, some in the sea and more in swimming pools.  I appreciate the importance the Deputy attaches to swimming facilities.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House to respond to this matter.  He asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government currently operates a swimming pool programme which is funded from national lottery moneys.  Under this programme, capital grants of up to 100 per cent are available towards the approved cost of refurbishing an <Col N="144" /> existing swimming pool and grants of up to 80 per cent are available towards the cost of constructing a new pool.  The proposed works must comply with the standards laid down in the Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines. The Department will also consider grant aiding up to 80 per cent of the cost of modest ancillary facilities, for example, saunas and steam rooms, as part of a proposal.  There is no provision under the programme for grants towards the day to day operation and maintenance of swimming pools.</P>
    <P>The current year's provision for the construction and refurbishment of swimming pools is £4 million.  However, this provision is fully committed to projects under construction or to projects which have been fully approved by the Department and on which work will commence later this year.  These projects will also give rise to a commitment of £4 million in 1999.  In addition, a total of nine refurbishment and 15 new pool projects, including five projects related to pools in the midland counties of Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois, are currently before the Department awaiting approval.  These 24 projects, which are at various stages of planning, are estimated to cost more than £44 million.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation provides grants towards the provision of major sports facilities which can incorporate swimming pools.  The current year's provision for major facilities is £6 million.</P>
    <P>As a means of securing improved co-ordination in the planning and financing of swimming pools generally, it is proposed to transfer the swimming pool programme currently operated by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  When the transfer takes place, the prioritising and approval of all new swimming pool projects in the context of the funds then available will be a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  The proposed transfer is likely to go ahead within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>Dé hAoine seo caite fuair 15 de na fostaithe i Telegael fógra go raibh a bpostanna ag imeacht.  Bhain siad go léir leis an rannóg athghuthaithe agus deineadh an cinneadh iad a scaoileadh thar oíche agus ní raibh fógra acu. Chomh maith leis sin bhíodar ag obair taobh istigh den Chomhlacht ar tháirgí nua a chur ar fáil agus margaí nua a aithint.  Bhíodar á dtraenáil i scileanna breise ionas nach mbeadh orthu a bheith ag braith ar ábhair athghuthaithe amháin ag deireadh na bliana.  Tríd an fógra seo beidh deireadh leis an ullmhúchán sin a bhí ar siúl acu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ar bhuail an tAire Stáit leis ha hoibrithe atá i gceist?  An raibh teangbháil aige leis an Údarás nó an bhfuil aon socrú déanta deontais speisialta <Col N="145" /> traenála a chur ar fáil do fho-chomhlacht taobh istigh den chomhlacht chun go mbeidh ar a gcumas an cúrsa atá ar siúl acu a chríochnú?</P>
    <P>Taobh amuigh de sin tá atmasféar uafásach le haireachtáil i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe faoi láthair ó thaobh Teilifís na Gaeilge de.  Bhí sé iontuigthe i gcomhnaí go mbeadh méadú airgid le fáil ag TnaG gach bliain chun cur ar a gcumas leathnú. Ach an rud atá ag tárlú faoi láthair ná go bhfuil píonós á chur orthu mar thoradh ar an miorúilt a rinne siad agus an méid uaireannta a chuir siad ar fáil agus mar sin de.  Ní bhfuair siad áfach an méadú a bheadh ag teastáil ó stáisiún nua chun cláracha a choimisiúniú.</P>
    <P>Ar thug an tAire Stáit freagra do na hoibrithe ar an litir a chuir siad chuige ar an 7 Bealtaine? D'iarr siad ar an Aire idirghabháil a dhéanamh idir an tÚdarás agus TnaG chun seift a chumadh chun go mbeadh siad in ann a bpostanna a choinneáil.  Baineann an 15 leis an nGaeltacht.  Is as an Ghaeltacht iad.</P>
    <P>Tá easpa suime i gcúrsaí clos-amharc agus i gcúrsaí scannáin le haireachtáil ag an pointe seo agus tá sin ag déanamh damáiste mór don Ghaeltacht agus don bhfostaíocht a bhaineann le clos-amharc agus le scannáin.  Dá bhrí sin iarraim go speisialta ar an Aire Stáit a rá cén sórt scéime atá aige anocht dos na hoibrithe atá i gceist.  Cad tá sé chun a dhéanamh?  Nó b'fhéidir, os rud é go bhfuil sé ag seasamh isteach i gcúrsaí craolacháin agus scannánaíochta anocht, go mbeidh sé in ann a rá an bhfuil aon chinneadh déanta ag an Aire sinsearach Síle de Valera chun dul i gcabhair ar na hoibrithe agus na deacrachtaí a shárú.</P>
    <P>An féidir leis a rá an mbeidh airgead breise á lorg sna meastacháin do TnaG chun cur ar a gcumas an coimisiúniú a leanúint nó b'fhéidir seift a chumadh sa ghearr-théarma chun go mbeadh sé ar chumas na n-oibrithe leanúint ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Grúpa cruthaitheach iad as an Ghaeltacht atá ag cailliúint a bpostanna go tobann gan aon sainmhíniú.  Tá sé scannalach.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch den Teachta Ó hUiginn as deis a thabhairt dom cuid de na ceisteanna atá ardaithe aige a shoiléiriú.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh ar an eolas mé ag bainistíocht an chomhlachta breis is seachtain ó shin go raibh fadhbanna acu agus is fíor a rá go ndearna oibrithe teangbháil liom ó shin.  Chomh deireannach le maidin inné bhí mé ag plé leis na hoibrithe.</P>
      <P>Is féidir liom a rá leis an Teachta Ó hUiginn dá mbeadh ar mo chumas go díreach cúnamh a thabhairt go dtabharfainn é go cinnte.  Níl aon fhadhb agam casadh leis na hoibrithe ach ní maith liom scéala a thabhairt do dhaoine gur féidir liom rudaí a dhéanamh nach féidir liom.  Mar is eol don Teachta dhá eagraíocht Stáit atá i gceist agus táid neamhspleách go reachtúil.  Is comhlacht príobháideach é seo ag deireadh an lae a thóg an cinneadh na hoibritheoirí a ligint chun siúl.</P>
      <P>Tá RTÉ i gceist a bhfuil cúram TnaG acu agus Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhunaigh Údarás na Gaeltachta áis léirithe <Col N="146" /> fiseáin Telegael Teo sa Spidéal i 1988 i gcomhpáirtíocht le RTÉ.  Tá an comhlacht féin ag feidhmiú ó 1990.  Cuireann an comhlacht áiseanna cuimsitheacha scannánaíochta agus eagarthóireachta ar fáil do léiriú cláracha físeán.  Tá cuid den trealamh agus teicneolaíocht is nua-aimseartha sa tír, áiseanna athghuthaithe agus fotheidealaithe san áireamh ag Telegael.  Is chomhchuideachta é Telegael Teo de chuid an Údaráis.</P>
    <P>Thug láinseáil Theilifís na Gaeilge treisiú mór do ghníomhaíochtaí Telegael, mar a thug sé do ghníomhaíochtaí léirithe físeán sa Ghaeltacht i gcoitinne.  Rinneadh athchóiriú substaintiúil ar áiseanna Thelegael agus an tseachtain seo caite bhí 38 duine fostaithe sa chomhlacht go lánaimseartha, le 20 duine eile fostaithe ar bhonn páirtaimseartha.</P>
    <P>Tháinig cinneadh Thelegael Dé hAoine seo caite chun fógra scoir a thabhairt do chúigear deag den fhoireann aniar aduaidh ar Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Is cinneadh de chuid an chomhlachta féin a bhí ann.  Thug Telegael le fios don Údarás go raibh laghdú tar éis teacht ar an méid gnó a bhí á fáil ag an gcomhlacht ó TnaG, agus, de bharr an athraithe seo ó thaobh TnaG de, bhí ar an gcomhlacht an chéim seo a ghlacadh agus fógra scoir a thabhairt do na hoibrithe.  Bíonn Telegael ag brath ar mhéid áirithe gnó ó TnaG agus ó RTÉ ó bhliain go bliain.</P>
    <P>Ní léir do Údarás na Gaeltachta ag an bpointe seo go bhfuil aon bhunús ann dó chun teacht i gcabhair ar an gcomhlacht.  Ar aon nós níl iarratas ar chabhair faighte aige ó Thelegael go dtí seo. Bhí cruinniú ag feidhmeannach de chuid an Údaráis leis na hoibrithe inniu agus tá a gcás á mbreithniú ag an Údarás.</P>
    <P>Tá soláthar reatha méadaithe de £10.63 milliún ar fáil do TnaG i mbliana i gcomparáid le soláthar de £10,204 milliún anuraidh.  Faoi mar is eol don Teachta níl ról ag an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltacha agus Oileán i dtaca le cláracha a choimisíniú do TnaG, agus cuirim béim ar seo.  Is gnó é sin do Theilifís na Gaeilge féin.</P>
    <P>Tá fiór spéis agam agus ag an Aire i dTnaG.</P>
    <P>Bhí mé ar cheann de na daoine bá thúisce a bhí ag éileamh soláthar ceart do chláracha teilifíse do dhaoine óga.  Tá mo thacaíocht le fáil do seo.  Mar a tharla nuair a ceapadh mar Aire mé, maraon leis an Aire féin, bhi go leor obair deanta ar sin. Ach is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith deimhneach go ndéanfaimid gach dícheall ní amháin go leanfaidh TnaG ach go bhfásfaidh sé de réir a chéile. Tiocfaimid ar thóir na n-achmhainí chun é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Táim tar éis cruinnithe agus teagmháil go rialta le TnaG ó ceapadh mar Aire Stáit mé agus tá an rud céanna déanta ag an chuig Aire sinsearach. Faoi mar a thuigim an scéal, níor tháinig éinne chugamsa nó an Aire faoi easpa airgid.  Is cinneadh é a thúg TnaG maidir le coimisiúin cláracha. Tá neamhspleáchas sa chinneadh sin agus mar sin is dóigh liom go bhfuil an Teachta ag díríu an cheist ar an dream mícheart.  Tá ceist ann cén fáth ar thóg TnaG an cinneadh sin ach is ceist do TnaG a fhreagairt.  Is cosúil gur cinneadh polasaí <Col N="147" /> de shaghas eicint ag Bord TnaG a bhí anseo agus b'fhéidir go míneoidh siad é sin.  Maidir le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta, tá siad ag plé leis na hoibrithe mar atá ráite agam.  Tá údarás acu a gcinneadh féin a dhéanamh, mar is eol don Teachta.  Ta siad neamhspleách go reachtúil.  Níl aon fhadhb agam casadh leis na hoibrithe am ar bith ach ní féidir liom tagairt a dhéanamh go díreach leo mar ní duirt éinne liomsa gur tháinig easpa airgid go tobann ar TnaG agus de thoradh sin bhí ar Telegael an cinneadh fíor-thobann seo a thógaint.  NÍ raibh ann ach fógra lae tugtha do dhuine ar bith fé mar a thuigim an scéal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue is an important one in the Adare area.  The school is expanding at a time when most schools in west Limerick are contracting.  There is extensive growth in the population in this area and an extra classroom is urgently required as a fourth teacher will be appointed in the next school year.</P>
      <P>Shountrade national school is three miles from Adare and is currently celebrating 60 years of dedicated service to the young people of the area. During that 60 years numbers have grown steadily.  In 1981 there were 33 pupils, in 1990, 60 pupils and there are now 94 pupils in the school.  This unique and exciting development is a success story, and I pay tribute to past and present teachers, principals, members of the boards of management, parents and the students themselves.  The school now has two permanent classrooms and one prefabricated building.  A fourth teacher will be appointed in September 1998 based on the current enrolment, and this will create a need for further accommodation.  The board of management is adamant that a permanent classroom should be built, as the projected enrolment for future years is approximately 100 pupils.  Sanitation in the school is very basic and must be upgraded to meet health and safety standards.  The new classroom and toilets must be in place for next September.</P>
      <P>The success of the school can be seen in the recent school assessment.  It states that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A feature of this school has always been the keen interest taken by the parents in the school and their support for it.  The high esteem in which the school is held by parents is due in large measure to a lifetime of dedicated service to the school and its pupils by the recently retired principal . there is a very pleasant rapport among the staff and between the staff and pupils and in general a very pleasant atmosphere is evident in the school . the principal and staff of this school are highly <Col N="148" /> commended for their dedication and commitment . the board of management and parents are also praised for their support for and interest in the school . throughout the school the teaching of Irish is done carefully and well, the students read English with confidence and clarity . writing in both languages is very satisfactory .in all sectors of the school the students proved themselves very well in mathematics and good use is made of concrete material to aid the pupils' understanding . an interest in nature and natural environment is fostered.  .history and geography are very well taught . a wider range of activities in art and craft is undertaken and integrated with the rest of the curriculum . a good program in teaching skills of major games with enthusiastic participation by pupils .</P>
    <P>This school needs proper accommodation and sanitary facilities to ensure its continued success. Prefabricated classrooms are unacceptable in 1998.  We have a duty to our young people, to our educational system and to our future leaders to have proper facilities for their education. Teachers should have proper accommodation also.  I urge the Minister and the Department to remove any obstacles to the school's progress and to ensure that the classroom is in place for the next academic year.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline our Department's current position regarding the provision of an additional classroom and toilets at Shountrade national school, County Limerick.  I am aware the school currently has a staffing level of a principal, two assistant teachers and one shared remedial teacher.  Based on the school's enrolment of 93 pupils at September 1997, it is expected a third assistant will be appointed this coming September and will be required for a period of three to four years.</P>
      <P>The school's existing accommodation consists of two permanent classrooms and a prefab.  It is predicted the school's long-term accommodation needs should cater for a staffing level of three teachers.  Our Department is aware that a number of pupils from outside the school's catchment area are being enrolled in this school, thereby putting pressure on its existing accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the request for an extension is that the school has submitted plans to our Department and these are currently being evaluated.  Our Department has requested additional information from the school so that a full examination of the proposal can be carried out.  This information is awaited by us and our Department will be in further contact with the <Col N="149" /> school following further consideration of the proposal by us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this question and I also thank the Minister of State for coming to reply to it.  The teachers, parents and board of management of Kilrickle national school are disappointed &mdash; indeed despairing &mdash; at the failure of the Department of Education and Science to sanction the repairs and refurbishment plans for the school.  The report of the inspector of the Office of Public Works for the work to the school at a cost of approximately £108,000 was forwarded to the Department in 1997.</P>
      <P>The school was built in 1922 and has never received a grant for maintenance or upkeep other than a contribution some 15 or 17 years ago towards the provision of heating, most of which was raised locally.  The Minister of State must realise that no Government has sanctioned funding for the maintenance and upkeep of the school for the past 75 years, which must be a record.  As a result the list of the school's requirements is long.</P>
      <P>I will mention some of the more serious requirements listed in the report.  The electric wiring has been in place since electricity was first provided in the area more than 50 years ago and as a result it is in a very dangerous condition.  It has perished in many places and is still used to provide power for the television, computer and other school equipment.  If an inspection of that school was carried out, I am sure that under the Health and Safety Act it would be condemned or threatened with closure.</P>
      <P>The roof is leaking and beyond repair and must be replaced as a matter of urgency because of flooding that takes place frequently in the school classrooms.  The windows and doors are rotten and have to be repaired and patched frequently because of the effect of the elements.  There is no drinking water for the pupils or teachers.  It is horrific that the water supply to that school is carried in a bucket from a local private residence.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is familiar with the school and we cannot allow this situation to continue. The toilets are outdoor and there are no teachers' toilets.  The bare wooden floors are noisy and mostly rotten and dangerous.  The partition that divides the school into two classrooms is paper thin and totally unsatisfactory.  I could continue, but the Minister of State has a picture of the condition of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite all the work needed to be done to the school, the projections for enrolment in the school over the next three to four years show a steady increase of between 15 and 20 per cent. That is unusual in a rural area, particularly in County Galway and indicates a further urgent need to repair the school which the Department cannot ignore.  Today a Department inspector visited the school and can verify the projected <Col N="150" /> increase in enrolment over the coming years.  It is hoped that by the year 2001 the projected increase in numbers will necessitate the appointment of an additional teacher to the school.</P>
    <P>Another unusual feature of the school is that no file exists in the Department of Education and Science for it.  Only recently has one been opened since the report was sent to the Department.  That is an indication of what the Department contributed to this school over the years, nothing.  Is there another school in the country with such a record?  I request the Minister as a matter of urgency to grant approval for the school's modest request so that we can show we cherish all our children equally.</P>
    <P>If approval for work to the school was given now, it could be completed by the start of the new school year in September 1998, with little or no disruption to school activity.  The waiting has gone on for far too long.  The misery must be stopped.  The children are entitled to something better than this in education in 1998.  I request the Minister to respond positively and to do so now.</P>
    <P>Those children are as entitled as any other children to the provision of a general purpose area in the school for remedial teaching, which does not exist at present.  It is unbelievable that school has only outdoor toilets.  The Minister of State and I share the same constituency and he has a particular interest in this school.  I ask him to sanction approval for work to be carried out to the school as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining our Department's current position in respect of the situation at Kilrickle national school, Loughrea, County Galway, in the historic constituency of Galway East.  I am aware that the school has a staffing of a principal, plus one assistant teacher.  The enrolment at the school is 49 pupils.  It is a three classroom school building.</P>
      <P>On 27 December 1996 an application was submitted by the school manager, requesting grant assistance towards major refurbishment work at Kilrickle national school.  On receipt of this application, our Department requested the regional architect at the Office of Public Works in Galway to visit the school and report on the need for refurbishment.</P>
      <P>On 20 December last, our Department received a detailed report from the Office of Public Works recommending major refurbishments. As the Deputy will be aware, the demands for capital funding at primary level are very considerable.  This is one of a number of projects, which is urgently seeking approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education and Science, myself and the Department fully appreciate the concerns expressed by the <Col N="151" /> school management.  In the meantime, the school receives an annual devolved grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil which can be used towards minor capital improvements.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and the school can be assured of our collective desire to see improvements in conditions <Col N="152" /> at the school and I thank him for the opportunity to outline the position on behalf of the Department of Education and Science.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 25, 32, 39, 41 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>For the 1997-8 academic year, CERT, the State tourism training agency, recruited 3,200 new entrants for full-time and elementary skills programmes, leaving 144 places for first year recruits in the institutes of technology spread over nine colleges and seven craft schools unfilled.  Meanwhile, because of the lengthening of the elementary skills programme for the unemployed, from 13 to 16 weeks, to meet national certification requirements, there was a reduction of 400 in the number of places available in the current academic year, on this programme.</P>
      <P>The rate of expansion in the tourism industry has been unprecedented in recent years.  Last year alone, a total of 51 new hotels were opened with a further 34 due to open this year.  Young people are increasingly entering the industry directly, such is the demand for employees.  Indeed in this respect, some students have left their studies in favour of employment in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is still evidence of staff and skills shortages in certain areas of the industry, these <Col N="154" /> shortages are in direct response to the levels of growth experienced by the industry.  I understand that CERT is not aware of any tourism establishment which has been unable to operate due to lack of personnel.  My Department is keenly aware of the ongoing need for qualified staff. CERT, through support provided under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99 have drawn up a comprehensive training programme to address these skill and staff shortages in the industry.  In excess of £12 million per annum is spent by CERT in training people for the industry, representing a major commitment by Government and the EU in recent years.</P>
    <P>Mainly through a number of media campaigns, both in print and national and local radio and vacancy information on Aertel, CERT have succeeded in maintaining recruitment levels close to previous years in a very competitive environment. CERT also run workshops for career guidance counsellors, give career talks and hold exhibitions in schools throughout the country.  The CERT National Recruitment Committee, which is representative of industry bodies, meets regularly to assist in the development of local promotional initiatives to attract new recruits to the industry.</P>
    <P>Today's school leavers, of course, have high expectations, and more and more are opting for hospitality and tourism management programmes and, the availability of such management college places is promoting this aspiration, complementing and supplementing CERT's training and development strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 26 together.  The tender procedure for a national conference centre is being organised by Bord Fáilte under the direction of the independent management board for product development, and is being conducted in full compliance with the EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC, concerning <Col N="155" /> the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts.</P>
      <P>The full tender procedure notice was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 13 September 1997, and in the Irish media on 16 September.  It invited applicants to submit requests to participate in the tender procedure by Monday, 20 October.  Bord Fáilte received 12 responses within this deadline set for receipt of applications to tender.  On 31 October 1997, &ldquo;invitation to tender&rdquo; documentation was dispatched by Bord Fáilte to seven qualified applicants, six of whom confirmed their intentions to submit full tenders before the deadline set, 14 November, for so doing.</P>
      <P>The closing deadline for receipt of tenders was at 5 p.m. on Monday 2 February.  Bord Failte received full tender submissions from five consortia, and immediately commenced its assessment of these submissions.  I understand that at the management board's meeting of 14 April 1998, the board considered these assessments and concluded that the tenders submitted were not such as to enable it to make a recommendation at that point in time.  The process has now proceeded to the &ldquo;negotiated procedure&rdquo; stage provided for in Article 7 of the directive, to be conducted by an independent team of technical experts.  The intention was that these experts would report to the board and provide it with the necessary technical advice to make a recommendation.</P>
      <P>As the House will already know, one of the tenderers has sought a judicial review of the decision to go to negotiated procedure and, as this is now <i>sub judice</i>, I cannot comment any further in relation to this aspect.  In such circumstances, it is difficult for the board to set a timeframe for finalising their deliberations.</P>
      <P>As to procedures, the tender process is being organised by Bord Fáilte and the independent management board.  Under the terms of the tourism operational programme, the agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will then be required in respect of any final selection made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final date for taking account of expenditure for projects assisted under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 is 31 December 2000, as defined by Article 5 of Commission Decision C(94) 1972 of 29 July 1994, subject to paragraph 4.6.7 of the Community Support Framework 1994-1999.  This paragraph states, <i>inter alia</i>, that &ldquo;at the request of the Member State, duly made before expiry of time limits and supported by information establishing the justification for such a change, the Commission services may extend the time limits by not more than one year.  If the extension requested is for more than one year, a formal Commission decision is required.  No expenditure incurred after the end date, as extended where appropriate, may be <Col N="156" /> taken into consideration for the grant of assistance from the Structural Funds&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A specific timescale for commencement or completion of the National Conference Centre project, or its subsequent availability for use, cannot be determined until the proposal has been formally approved by the Government and the European Commission, and matters such as planning permission are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Government's key priorities is to ensure a more focused and better co-ordinated response by the statutory authorities in addressing the needs of severely disadvantaged urban communities.  To that end, the inter-departmental committee on local development, which I chair, has been given a mandate to oversee an integrated services project which aims to produce a model of best practice that can be extended to other deprived urban areas.</P>
      <P>The pilot project will target four areas, viz.  :</P>
      <P>Dublin's North East Inner City, the Canal Communities (Fatima Mansions, St. Teresa's Gardens, St. Michael's House, Dolphin House), Jobstown, Tallaght, and Togher, Cork.</P>
      <P>The initial stage of the project will involve consultation with local communities about the needs of their areas; profiling existing services and resources; identifying the extent of integration between them; and devising a framework to enhance co-ordination and integration efforts.</P>
      <P>A steering group comprising representatives from the Departments of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment and Local Government and from Area Development Management Ltd.  has been established under the auspices of the Inter-departmental Committee on Local Development to oversee the project.  Given ADM's experience in relation to partnerships and its knowledge of local communities, it has been given an important role in the day-to-day management of the project. ADM has already consulted the relevant partnerships to ask for their support and co-operation in advancing the project and the response has been positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the operational level, ADM has now appointed a central co-ordinator to oversee the project's implementation.  Reports will be drawn up on the four areas, in consultation with the local communities.  It is intended that initial reports will be completed by July.  I hope that final recommendations will go to the Cabinet <Col N="157" /> committee on Social Inclusion in the autumn. Action after that date will be determined by the nature of the recommendations and the decisions of the Cabinet committee.</P>

      <P>Some £9 million is provided in the Estimates of my Department for 1998 in respect of the sports capital programme.  This important programme provides national lottery funding towards the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is the primary vehicle for promoting the development of sport and recreational facilities in Ireland and currently comprises the major facilities and recreational facilities schemes.  The major facilities scheme is a capital programme for major facilities at national, regional and local level.  The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary and community organisations in providing, improving and equipping recreational, leisure and community facilities.  Under the programme for 1998 £3 million is provided for the recreational facilities scheme and £6 million for the major facilities scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sports capital programme is multi-annual in that funds available in 1998 will go towards meeting outstanding commitments under the programme.  A total of £19.8 million is currently committed under the programme.  This includes about <Col N="158" /> £5 million which I allocated recently to a range of projects throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Safety at sports fixtures is the responsibility in the first instance of those who organise events and those who own or administer the grounds or venue in which fixtures are held.  Issues related to crowd safety at sports fixtures are governed by a number of legislative provisions operating under the aegis of my colleagues, the Ministers for Environment and Local Government; Health and Children, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science facilitated the preparation of and in January 1996 published, for the guidance of organisers and <Col N="159" /> ground administrators, a detailed and comprehensive code of practice for safety at sports grounds.  The code was prepared by a working party, chaired by a senior local authority official, which also included a senior garda, a chief fire officer, a local authority building surveyor and a local authority senior structural engineer.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitment given in its joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, to invite proposals for a national 50 metre swimming pool, the Government decided in December 1997 to initiate a tender procedure to invite such proposals.  The tender procedure is being conducted in line with the procedures set out in EU Council Directive 93/37/EEC.  The tender procedure notice for the project was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on Wednesday, 21 January 1998 and in the Irish media on the following day.  The invitation was open to both the public and private sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developers were requested to come forward with proposals for the design, construction, financing and management of a 50 metre swimming pool, capable primarily of meeting the training requirements of Ireland's high-performance swimmers for international competition.  They were also required to demonstrate that they had the necessary financial status, technical knowledge <Col N="160" /> and experience to undertake the project. The final date for receipt of candidatures was 5 March 1998.</P>
    <P>Invitation to tender, ITT, documentation, including a comprehensive project brief, issued to nine qualified candidates on 26 March, inviting them to prepare full tender submissions for the project.  The Department has advised candidates that the draft contract-legal agreement for the project is currently being finalised and will not be available for a number of weeks yet.  It is not possible at this stage, therefore, to say precisely when a final decision will be made.</P>
    <P>As all tenders submitted will contain information of a commercially sensitive nature, particular to individual tenderers, details will not be made public.  Work on the 50 metre swimming pool will only be in a position to commence when a successful tenderer has been identified and matters such as planning permission are in place.  It is anticipated that the construction phase of the project will be 15 months from the date of any agreement, although a longer period will be considered in the light of submitted proposals.</P>

      <P>I have not yet received the report of the Murphy inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming.  An interim injunction has been obtained, the effect of which is preventing Dr. Murphy temporarily from finalising his report.  Dr. Murphy is seeking to have the injunction set aside as soon as possible and must await the outcome of these proceedings before he can finalise his report.</P>
      <P>In relation to the publication of the report, I reiterate what I stated in the House that when I have received Dr. Murphy's final report and given it initial consideration, I intend to make its findings public.  However, a decision on publication of the full contents of his report cannot be made until it is received, and all the implications of publication have been considered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that £20 million of the £30 million committed to the young people's facilities and services fund over the next three years will be targeted at the 13 local drugs task force areas.  The guidelines for the operation of the fund in these areas were announced yesterday.  I will forward a copy of the guidelines to the Deputy for his information.</P>
      <P>These guidelines set out in general terms: the objectives of the fund in the task force areas; the process by which integrated plans for each area will be developed and assessed, and the broad criteria that will be applied in assessing the plans.</P>
      <P>The guidelines provide for funding under five broad headings: the enhancement and integration of existing facilities and services for young people in the target areas; the development of new viable facilities and amenities, including sport and recreational facilities, in these areas where a gap has been identified; the development of strategies to attract at risk young people into the facilities; the development of additional youth services for the target group, and the provision of support to voluntary and community groups and organisations working with at risk young people.</P>
      <P>I have written to the task force chairpersons asking them to convene the first meeting of development groups, comprising representatives from the local drug task forces, the relevant local authority and VEC, who will be responsible for developing integrated plans for their areas.</P>
      <P>An assessment committee has also been established, chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, with representatives drawn from relevant Departments and agencies and the National Drugs Strategy Team, whose representation will include a voluntary-community representative, will assess all plans on the basis of the criteria established.  It will make recommendations on funding to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs.  The final decision to fund projects submitted will be taken by the Government on the recommendation of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs.</P>
      <P>In broad terms, plans will be assessed on the viability and sustainability of the individual projects within the plan; the level to which they are integrated with other services and facilities; the extent to which they are additional and complementary with regard to existing facilities and services, and the extent to which they maximise the use of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remaining £10 million in the fund will be targeted at areas outside the task force areas <Col N="162" /> where serious drug problems exist or have the potential to develop.  The arrangements for the allocation of this money are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>

      <P>Specific targets have been set under the operational programme for tourism 1994-9 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme 70 per cent of visitors came to Ireland during the off-peak season and the aim is to increase this figure to 75 per cent by 1999.  The mid-term target set out in the programme is for 72 per cent of visitors to arrive outside the peak period and I am happy that this target was reached during 1996.</P>
      <P>On the product development side, the addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years is helping to improve the seasonal profile of the tourism product range. The assistance which the industry has received under the tourism operational programme has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the marketing side, the overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative, promotes Ireland on a year round basis in the key tourism markets of the US, Britain, France and Germany. Many of its campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.  Tourism Brand Ireland is a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing, designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday experience such as human interaction, culture and historical heritage which are not season dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Celtic Flame festival is a tourism council initiative with seasonality as one of its core objectives The festival was devised to provide overseas visitors with a reason to visit Ireland in the off-peak.  The 1998 festival took place in various venues throughout the country during February and March and the diversity of venues selected ensured that areas beyond the main tourism centres could benefit from tourism in the off-season.  Another initiative to help address the seasonality issue is the reinvigorated national St. Patrick's Day festival in Dublin.  By attracting visitors to Ireland during March, and gaining positive coverage of Ireland celebrating at this time, <Col N="163" /> the festival is making a very important contribution to the seasonality issue The regional tourism marketing initiative, launched in January, is currently under way.  The initiative focuses on the promotion within the home market of short breaks in Ireland, again with emphasis on the off-peak.  Results based on the Irish travel survey 1997 show a significant increase in the number of short holiday trips taken in 1997, plus 34 per cent.  Spend on short holidays also increased significantly, plus 37 per cent.  As part of the campaign the Discover Ireland Holiday Show, which focused attention on the diversity offered by the various regions, took place in the Dublin Tourism Centre from 5-15 March of this year.</P>
    <P>According to estimates prepared by the Central Statistics Office, approximately 1.93 million overseas tourists came to Ireland in the period September 1995 to March 1996 and 2.12 million in the period September 1996 to March 1997.  Figures for the first quarter of 1998 are not yet available, but in the period September to December 1997, the CSO estimates that 1.5 million overseas visitors came to Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is significant cross-Border co-operation at both Departmental and Agency level in the tourism area.  Co-operation at agency level, between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, has existed since the 1960s and has been considerably strengthened and facilitated in recent years by the availability of financial assistance for marketing and product development from both the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland.  In addition, there have been regular contacts and co-operation between the two Departments on a range of issues of common interest in the tourism area. Since taking up office, I have had a number of contacts with my Northern Ireland counterpart, Minister Adam Ingram, MP, in particular in relation to joint tourism promotion activities.</P>
      <P>As a result of the ongoing contacts which I have outlined, I believe that myself and my Department have a good appreciation of the possible areas of common interest and co-operation which exist in tourism and which hopefully will be further developed, to the mutual benefit of both parts of the island as part of the present Peace Process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards sport, my Department and the Irish <Col N="164" /> Sports Council are in ongoing consultation with the Sports Council for Northern Ireland to explore areas of co-operation in the overall development of sport on an all-island basis.  These include sports development and governing bodies of sport; children and young people's sport; coaching; anti-doping; leadership and training in recreational sport and mutual policy and strategic initiatives.  Two cross-Border pilot programmes are currently under way &mdash; Youth Sport Foyle (developing school sport) and a leadership programme in recreational sport and sport for all. The chief executive officer of the Sports Council for Northern Ireland is a member of the Irish Sports Council.</P>
    <P>In so far as local development is concerned, ADM Ltd.  jointly administers the cross-Border Reconciliation Measure of the EU Peace and Reconciliation Programme with the Combat Poverty Agency and the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust.  I also understand that strong informal links have been developed between ADM Ltd.  and the Northern Ireland Partnership Board on the development of local partnership structures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister, I have overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy in the areas of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and, through my Department, for monitoring its implementation. The execution of policy is a matter for the State <Col N="165" /> Agencies under the remit of my Department. These include Bord Fáilte Éireann, CERT and Shannon Development in respect of tourism development in the mid-west region.  Exchequer funding for these bodies is provided through the voted expenditure of my Department as set out in the Book of Estimates each year.</P>
    <P>Funding is also provided through my Department's Vote to ADM Limited in respect of the provision of matching Exchequer finance for management of EU Programmes for Local, Urban and Rural Development and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.  A similar position applies in the case of funding from the EU Tourism Operational Programme for Bord Fáilte activities and for Shannon Development specifically in regard to their investment in product development.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department provides national lottery funds under various schemes to national governing bodies of sport and other organisations and groups involved in the delivery of sport and recreation.  These independent organisations are financially accountable to the Department in respect of the funding provided to them under the terms and conditions of the relevant schemes. Funding is also provided through my Department's Vote for the Drugs Initiative.  Such funding is then transferred, through the appropriate Department, to the statutory agencies identified as the relevant channel of funding for approved programmes/services in the plans of Local Drugs Task Forces.  Each statutory agency is responsible for complying with normal financial procedures in relation to the disbursement of funds allocated to it.</P>
    <P>All the funds discharged through my Department's Vote are monitored and controlled in accordance with public financial procedures established by the Department of Finance.  In addition, the accounts of my Department and the State agencies under its aegis are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and together with his report thereon are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Secretary General of my Department and the chief executives of the State bodies under its aegis are subject to examination by the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the accounting procedures and financial controls in place are reasonable and provide for full accountability in accordance with public financial procedures.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that all regions have benefited from the increase in tourist numbers to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The most recent official statistics published by the Central Statistics Office last month show a healthy 9 per cent increase in overseas visitors for 1997 with revenue increasing by 12 per cent over the same period, recording yet another successful year for Irish tourism.  That said, concerns were expressed from some quarters that the increase in tourism growth was not equitably distributed throughout all regions.  The available Bord Fáilte estimates on tourism revenue show that growth rates have been achieved in all regions in Ireland in recent years which are better than International and European averages.</P>
      <P>However, although all regions have shared in this growth, there has been some variation in performance.  With that in mind, I made an extra £5 million available to Bord Fáilte late last year to enable it to increase and intensify its level of promotional and marketing activity for the coming tourist season, with the particular objective of securing a broader regional distribution of tourism revenue.  Bord Fáilte, has devised a multi-layered approach which consists of enhancing existing programmes, introducing new regional initiatives and exploiting opportunities which are coming on stream.  It is Bord Fáilte's intention to have a strong regional emphasis in the activities proposed and to maximise the return by integrating activity at local, regional and national levels.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism authorities will continue to closely monitor the situation to assess if there are perceived difficulties in certain regions and, if so, to see how they can be most effectively addressed.</P>

      <Quest>if, in relation to the evaluation of unpaid work, the CSO can evaluate the full extent of the contribution of unpaid work; the effectiveness of the quarterly national household survey in this regard; if the Government will act on its findings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Unpaid work is not covered in the Irish national accounts which are compiled in accordance with recognised international standards.  These standards do not include the evaluation of unpaid work as part of the core <Col N="168" /> accounts.  However, they do allow for unwaged work to be included in satellite accounts.  These are used to extend the core system to provide information on topics where the estimation methods are not sufficiently developed to allow their inclusion in the main system.</P>
      <P>The quarterly national household survey is not an appropriate vehicle for the collection of information on this type of work because of its concentration on participation in the labour force which is defined in terms of paid or gainful employment. Time use surveys are considered to be the most appropriate means of developing the required information i.e. the time people spend on different types of unpaid work.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, carried out a small scale pilot survey of some 300 households in 1997 in order to consider the feasibility and cost of conducting a large scale national survey.  It is clear from this pilot survey and experience in other countries that a full survey would be extremely costly.</P>
      <P>In its Statement of Strategy 1998-2000, the CSO has indicated that it will seek Government approval and the necessary resources to conduct a time use survey in 2000.  The Government will consider such a request in the light of forthcoming recommendations from the National Statistics Board on statistical priorities.</P>

      <P>The Company Law Review Group recommended changes in company law in respect of six of the areas that were examined by the group.</P>
      <P>I propose to implement those recommendations of the group considered appropriate on a phased basis, starting with a Bill which I plan to introduce later this year to amend the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, the &ldquo;examinership&rdquo; Act, and to remove the statutory audit requirement for certain small companies.  The remaining areas on which the group made recommendations relate to investigations, insider dealing, corporate governance issues relating to the preparation, content and regulation of financial statements and related matters, and the restriction and-or disqualification of directors of insolvent companies.  I will bring forward proposals in these areas when they have been evaluated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals in respect of examinership will apply to all companies, while those relating to removal of the statutory audit requirement will relate specifically to private limited companies that meet specific criteria.  The proposals in relation to examinership will effectively streamline <Col N="169" /> the examinership process which is designed to assist companies in financial difficulties.  The removal of the statutory audit requirement for certain private limited companies will effectively reduce burdens on such companies by removing the necessity for them to have their annual accounts audited.</P>
    <P>In general, the recommendations in the other areas are designed to make the existing statutory provisions more effective or to introduce new requirements.</P>

      <P>Under the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990, the Labour Relations Commission (LRC) the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioners can only investigate an industrial dispute if the employees involved are covered by the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the dispute is a &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo; as defined in the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  On the basis of legal advice available to my Department, a person whose contract of employment has been terminated by retirement is no longer a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; for the purpose of the Industrial Relations Acts.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, based on that advice, a dispute concerning pension arrangements is only considered to be a &ldquo;trade dispute&rdquo;, within the meaning of the 1946 Act, while a person is still employed; it ceases to be such when the person retires.</P>
      <P>Because of this situation the LRC, the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioners cannot deal with disputes about pensions in the case of retired people.  I am not aware that a significant number of such cases have been referred to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pensions Act, 1990, (as amended) contains provisions for the proper administration of occupational pension schemes and the protection of the rights of members of such schemes.  If a member of a scheme is concerned that the trustees of that scheme have not complied with a provision of the Pensions Act, he or she may complain to <Col N="170" /> the Pensions Board.  The board has extensive powers of investigation and other powers under the Act.  The Act provides for penalties where a person is found not to have carried out his or her duties under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has asked the Pensions Board, during its current term of office, to examine the issue of a pensions Ombudsman and the form that such an office might take.  The board is expected to report before the end of this year.  The matter will then be considered by the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>Investment of over £17 million in tourism angling development is being supported under the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999.  The objective is to create a world class tourism angling product through targeted development of game, coarse and sea angling throughout the regions. The investment in the inland fisheries resource and tourism angling facilities is designed to attract significantly increased numbers of tourist anglers to Ireland with resultant increases in revenue and job creation.  It will also contribute to objectives and targets for the national tourism product overall.</P>
      <P>A key strategic priority in this context is to ensure that the investment in development of the resource is matched by sustained overseas marketing of the tourism angling product.</P>
      <P>The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and Bord Fáilte are already working closely together in overseeing and delivering on investment strategies to develop and promote tourism angling in line with the overall objectives.  On the marketing front I have arranged for £300,000 under the tourism angling measure to be made available for immediate angling market research and overseas promotion.  I have requested the Central Fisheries Board and Bord Fáilte to work together on this important initiative.  A detailed spending plan is being prepared jointly by the agencies and I expect to receive this in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>My policy objective is to secure the future for salmon in its own right and in the economic interests of our rural and coastal communities which it supports.</P>
      <P>A basic tenet of this policy is that the balance of advantage, on conservation, ecological and economic grounds, should lie increasingly with redirecting salmon exploitation towards the rivers and estuaries.</P>
      <P>I have continued this year with the conservation measures recommended by the Salmon</P>
      <P>Management Task Force including reduction in the prescribed maximum number of licences; reduction in sea fishing area for salmon from 12 to six nautical miles from the baselines; driftnet fishery at sea commencement date deferred to 1 June, and driftnet fishery commencement date deferred to 12 May and reduction of fishing time to four days per week, and day-only fishing for driftnets at sea.</P>
      <P>I launched last February the technical report by the Marine Institute into the practical implementation of the quota based salmon management system recommended by the Salmon Task Force.  I used that occasion to set out in detail my policy for the salmon resource which is designed to bring about incremental strategic change in conservation and management in the interests of the salmon resource and all the legitimate interests in that resource.</P>
      <P>I am committed to moving ahead on our ambitious agenda for salmon, this year and beyond.  My priority is to ensure that salmon and salmon habitats are protected and conserved in the face of a wide variety of threats to their viability.  This priority is set in the context of a comprehensive programme of strategies which aim to deliver on the management, development and information needs of the resource in a cost efficient and effective way.  I have stressed that progress will require the continued confidence and co-operation of all sides and acknowledge that the process of change is an incremental one. I have mandated the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and the Department to work together on all the necessary strategies to deliver on my policy objectives for the salmon resource.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish citizens intending to get married in certain foreign countries are required by the authorities in those countries to produce <i>certificats de coutume</i> or certificates of freedom to marry.  Such certificates are obtainable from the Department of Foreign Affairs or from the Irish Embassy in the country where the Irish persons concerned normally reside on presentation of the long forms of their birth certificates, completed questionnaires, completed statutory declarations witnessed by notaries public, commissioners for oaths or solicitors and payment of a statutory fee of £10.  The form of declaration made by Irish citizens with foreign divorce decrees differs from that made by persons who have never previously been married or whose marriages have been dissolved by means of an Irish divorce decree; persons who have previously been married and who have divorced abroad are also required to present their divorce decree and certain other documents may also be requested depending on the individual circumstances of the case.  Such persons are also advised in writing by means of a note on the statutory declaration form issued to them to seek <Col N="173" /> legal advice prior to making their statutory declarations.  Such advice is necessary as the law in this area is complex.  The certificates are normally issued within a month of application.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give an exhaustive definition of the meaning of domicile in Irish law as the concept is complex and derives from court judgments which deal with particular sets of individual circumstances, the common law, the Constitution and the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986.  However, it is possible to say in a general way that for the purposes of Irish law an adult individual is domiciled in the country where he or she is resident and intends to reside permanently or indefinitely.  If the individual has no fixed intention he or she is domiciled in his or her domicile of origin: an individuals domicile of origin is generally dependent on the domicile held by his or her father at the time of his or her birth.</P>
      <P>For a foreign divorce to be recognised in Ireland under the Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act, 1986, it is generally necessary that at least one of the parties to the divorce proceedings have been domiciled in the foreign jurisdiction concerned at the date of the institution of the divorce proceedings.  In the case of UK divorces it is sufficient that one of the parties to the marriage has been domiciled in any of the jurisdictions that make up the United Kingdom, i.e. England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, at that date.  Statements made in the statutory declarations presented in connection with applications for <i>certificats de coutume</i> are therefore checked to confirm this point before such certificates are issued.  Additional evidence such as statements made in petitions for divorce, affidavits from former spouses and documentary evidence of property holdings and bank accounts may also be required, depending on the circumstances of particular cases.</P>
      <P>The person named by the Deputy has been domiciled at all times in Ireland and has been refused permission to marry in Ireland by the Registrar-General of Births, Marriages and Deaths because of lack of proof that his wife was domiciled in a United Kingdom jurisdiction at the date that he instituted divorce proceedings in England and Wales.  He has produced evidence to the Department of Foreign Affairs additional to that produced to the Registrar-General but it is not sufficient to prove that his wife was so domiciled.  He is, therefore, being informed that a <i>certificat de coutume</i> for him cannot be issued in the absence of (a) further evidence of the place of domicile of his wife at the date of the institution of divorce proceedings, (b) an Irish court order under the Family Law Act, 1995, with the Attorney General joined as party to the proceedings, recognising his foreign divorce or (c) an Irish divorce decree.</P>

Nevertheless, when the board was being abolished in 1994, they were offered voluntary early retirement.  None of the persons referred to by the Deputy accepted the early retirement package but instead decided to take up employment with the new owners of the board's ancillary business.  Any change in their terms and conditions of employment is, therefore, a matter between themselves and their current employer.

As a result of this investigation, it has been decided that the person named is due a further payment of £1,423.71 on 27 animals under the January 1993 special beef premium scheme.  He is also due 1993 extensification premium of £711.72 on those animals.  Those payments will issue shortly.</P>

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 76 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners advise me that repayments of excise duty paid on hydrocarbon, heavy, oils used in the provision of passenger road services can be claimed under the provisions of paragraph 12 (11) of the Imposition of Duties (No. 221) (Excise Duties) Order, 1975, SI No. 307 of 1975.  The requirements for claiming repayments are that the operator must be a licensee under a passenger licence granted under section 11 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, in respect of the passenger road service within the meaning of section 2 of that Act or must be exempted from the application of section 7 of that Act; the excise duty on hydrocarbon oils imposed by paragraph 12 (1) of SI No. 307 of 1975 must have been paid on the oil used for combustion in the engine of a mechanically propelled vehicle in providing the service.  Section 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, created an offence for operating an unlicensed passenger road service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> Section 24 of the Transport Act, 1958, provided an exemption for CIE from the application of section 7.</P>
    <P>The rate of repayment is laid down in section 73(7) of the Finance Act, 1984.  The rate is &ldquo;the amount of excise duty paid less an amount calculated at the rate of £1.  79 per hectolitre&rdquo;.  The rate applies to all qualifying journeys, regardless of whether the operator is a licensee under section 11 of the Road Transport Act, 1932, or is exempt from licence by virtue of section 7 of the Road Transport Act, 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 87 together.</P>
      <P>Domiciliary care allowance &mdash; DCA &mdash; is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are severely physically or mentally disabled and who require constant care and supervision substantially greater than that which would normally be required by a child of the same age.  The scheme was introduced by way of Circular 24/73 in 1973 and operates under section 61 of the 1970 Health Act.</P>
      <P>The scheme applies to children aged between two and 16 years and only the means of the child are taken into account, for example, a child who receives a payment of compensation resulting in an income in excess of the allowances does not qualify.  The current rate of the allowance is £103.60 per month.  The medical assessment is carried out by health board medical personnel. In some cases, depending on medical condition, eligibility is reviewed at regular intervals, for example, if the child's condition improves, he or she may no longer meet the criteria for eligibility. The allowance is not paid in respect of children maintained in institutions.  However, where a child is at home for a continuous period of more than two months, for example, summer holidays, the allowance may be granted for that period. Allowances amounting to a total of £11.2 million were paid to 8,812 recipients in 1997.</P>
      <P>At present the scheme does not cover children under the age of two years.  Children below the age of two normally require constant care and attention in any event.  However, there are other supports available to parents who are experiencing difficulties in caring for a child of under two years.  For example, they may apply to their local community welfare officer for help under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  Furthermore, if the child's condition requires frequent and expensive medical treatment a child may be awarded a medical card in his or her own right by the health board.  Parents may also seek advice and support from the boards in obtaining necessary aids and appliances.</P>

The cumulative numbers of children with HIV and with AIDS reported to that date are as follows: 129 of HIV cases which represents 6.97 per cent of the total HIV reported positive cases of 1,850 and 18 AIDS cases which represents 2.95 per cent of the total reported AIDS cases of 609. Of these 609 AIDS cases 311 have died, seven of whom were children.</P>
      <P>Specialist treatment and care of children who are HIV positive or who have AIDS is provided at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.  A number of children are receiving complicated therapeutic regimens, with up to seven different medications, some three times a day.  In addition, children and their families receive counselling and support. This must continue through school and into adolescence.  Because of the improved effectiveness of drug therapy in the treatment of HIV, children are now living longer, healthier lives, but these children will continue to need treatment and care into adulthood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work.</P>
      <P>I am aware there are different timescales for the completion of the assessment process in the different health boards.  This difference arises principally from the greater volume of applications in some areas.  Assigning of staff to specific duties so that health boards can fulfil their legislative responsibilities is a matter for the chief executive officer of each health board.  The situation in the Eastern Health Board is that arising from the additional funding approved to the board for child care services in 1998 the board has proposed, in its 1998 service plan, the appointment of three new social workers to its adoption service.  I understand that one additional social worker has so far been appointed by the board to the task of assessing applicants for foreign adoptions.</P>
      <P>I recently travelled to Romania and China to put in place arrangements to facilitate prospective Irish adopters who wish to adopt children from these countries.  Ireland signed the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption in 1996.  Major amendment of our foreign adoption legislation will be required prior to ratification of the convention.  Implementation of the convention will mean bilateral state to state processing of adoption applications from prospective Irish adopters to other countries which have ratified the convention.  Arising from these developments and other trends in Irish society such as increasing prosperity and multiculturalism, I expect the number of applications for adoption assessments to increase further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that simply assigning more social workers to deal with an ever expanding case load is the most efficient way of dealing with this situation, particularly when one considers the other areas of pressing need in our child care services.  It is also necessary to consider how health boards can best utilise existing resources to manage cases and whether or not legislative change is required to assist them in this regard.  I have had <Col N="183" /> discussions on the issue of foreign adoption assessments with the Eastern Health Board, with the Health Board Programme Managers Group, the Irish Foreign Adoption Group and the Council of Irish Adoption Agencies and I will be having further discussions on the issue.  If as a result of these discussions, it becomes obvious to me that legislative change is required, then I would consider that the most appropriate forum to implement such change is the Bill to ratify the Hague Convention.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the situation of day nursery staff employed by voluntary organisations which are in receipt of a contribution towards their costs from the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>As I said in the House on the Adjournment last week, the day care nurseries in the Eastern Health Board region are autonomous bodies which are independent of the board in relation to their day-to-day operation.  Their employees are not employees of the board and their pay, terms and conditions of employment are not controlled by the board.  Consequently the implementation of the Labour Court recommendation is a matter for the management of the day nurseries as the direct employer and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>Because the health board determines the levels of funding and service levels, payment of claims such as this would impact on its overall child care services.  It is in that context that the board has participated in ongoing discussions between the management of the nurseries, the Health Service Employers Agency and IMPACT on the implementation of the recommendation.  I understand that IMPACT has now rejected management's offer and has served strike notice on the voluntary organisations to take effect from Wednesday 27 May.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the union to defer its action, which will cause hardship to a very vulnerable group of children and their parents and carers, and to return to negotiations with management and the Health Service Employers Agency with a view to finding some resolution in the context of the Labour Court recommendation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased fuel allowance arises in the context of my recent extension of the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, already in place in Dublin and Cork cities, to an additional five major urban areas from 1 October 1998.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will pay, during the winter heating season, the supplementary fuel allowance of £3 per week to people in receipt of the national fuel allowance payment of £5 per week and to other qualifying social welfare recipients in the restricted areas specified in the First Schedule of the Air Pollution Act, 1987 (Marketing, Sale and Distribution of Fuels) Regulations, 1998 (S.I. No. 118 of 1998) to assist lower income households with the increased cost of smokeless solid fuel.</P>
      <P>The selection of the additional restricted areas to which these regulations apply was based on an analysis of air quality monitoring results over recent years.  While mandatory national and EU air quality standards were not breached anywhere in Ireland during the 1996-97 heating season, October to March, higher than average smoke levels were experienced in Limerick city, Arklow, Dundalk, Drogheda and Wexford town.  In banning bituminous coal in these areas, I am adopting a precautionary approach, which will achieve the better standards enjoyed by Dublin and Cork. Air quality data in all monitored urban areas and the need for further action will be kept under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>Specific targets have been set under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999 for improving tourism activity in the shoulder and off-peak seasons.  At the beginning of the programme 70 per cent of visitors came to Ireland during the off-peak season and the aim is to increase this figure to 75 per cent by 1999.  The mid-term target set out in the Programme is for 72 per cent of visitors to arrive outside the peak period and I am happy that this target was reached during 1996.</P>
      <P>On the product development side, the addition to the range and quality of weather independent facilities in recent years is helping to improve the seasonal profile of the tourism product range. The assistance which the industry has received under the tourism operational programme has been of considerable benefit in this regard.</P>
      <P>On the marketing side, the overseas tourism marketing initiative, which is a State-industry partnership marketing initiative, promotes Ireland on a year round basis in the key tourism markets of the US, Britain, France and Germany Many of its campaigns are directed at attracting visitors outside the peak season.  Tourism Brand Ireland is a key part of a new strategic approach to marketing, designed to address major issues such as yield, regional spread and seasonality The advertising emphasis is on aspects of the Irish holiday experience such as human interaction, culture and historical heritage which are not season-dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Celtic Flame festival is a tourism council initiative with seasonality as one of its core objectives.  The festival was devised to provide overseas visitors with a reason to visit Ireland in the off-peak season.  The 1998 festival took place in various venues throughout the country during February and March, and the diversity of venues selected ensured that areas beyond the main tourism centres could benefit from tourism in the off-season.  Another initiative to help address the seasonality issue is the reinvigorated national St. Patrick's festival in Dublin.  By attracting visitors to Ireland during March, and gaining positive coverage of Ireland celebrating at this time, the <Col N="194" /> festival is making a very important contribution to the seasonality issue.</P>
    <P>Finally, the regional tourism marketing initiative, launched in January, is currently under way. The initiative focuses on the promotion within the home market of short breaks in Ireland, again with emphasis on the off peak.  Results based on the Irish travel survey, 1997 show a significant increase of 34 per cent in the number of short holiday trips taken in 1997.  Spend on short holidays also increased significantly, by 37 per cent.  As part of the campaign the Discover Ireland holiday show, which focused attention on the diversity offered by the various regions, took place in the Dublin Tourism Centre from 5 to 15 March this year.</P>
    <P>According to estimates prepared by the Central Statistics Office, approximately 1.93 million overseas tourists came to Ireland in the period September 1995 to March 1996 and 2.12 million in the period September 1996 to March 1997.  Figures for the first quarter of 1998 are not yet available, but in the period September to December 1997, the CSO estimates that 1.5 million overseas visitors came to Ireland.</P>

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants towards the day to day running costs of schools.  In 1998, the standard rate of grant per pupil at primary level was increased from £45 to £50, an increase of 11 per cent.  This increase is an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out to the Deputy that there is <Col N="196" /> a minimum rate of grant applicable to schools with an enrolment of 60 pupils or fewer.  I increased this minimum grant in 1998 from £2,700 to £3,000.</P>
    <P>The way in which funding is provided to second level schools reflects the different management and ownership arrangements for voluntary secondary schools, vocational schools, community colleges and community and comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>The financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to the vocational education committees as part of a block grant which also covers the VEC overheads and other activities outside of the second level programme.  Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a <i>per capita</i> basis while the annual budget for community and comprehensive schools takes into account factors which vary from school to school such as enrolments, age of buildings and size of school.</P>
    <P>The capitation rate per pupil attending a voluntary secondary school amounts to £177.  An additional capitation grant of £30 per pupil is paid to schools which have been designated as disadvantaged.  Accordingly, the overall capitation grant paid to such schools amounts to £207 per pupil.  In addition, voluntary secondary schools may also be eligible for assistance under a range of other grants in the free education scheme including grants for the employment of caretakers and secretaries and certain curricular support grants.</P>
    <P>The matter of equity of funding between the various sectors at second level is currently being examined by a steering group on funding.  Under its terms of reference, the group will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of these different schools. When the group's findings become available, they will inform the manner in which account is taken of the particular circumstances of individual schools for the purpose of allocating resources.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to keep the position of schools with declining enrolments under review and allocate available resources to schools in greatest need over the coming years.</P>

This increased amount will be used to augment the adult literacy service.  The precise use to be made of it is at present under consideration in my Department.

      <P>The arts and drama are encouraged in the present curriculum for primary schools.  A comprehensive review of this curriculum is now almost complete.  Important sections of this revised curriculum will deal with the development of the arts and drama in the schools. Schools do occasionally avail of the services of visiting theatre workshops.  Where a financial contribution is necessary for this it is usually met out of school resources.  However, some funding is available to support theatre workshops which address the needs of disadvantaged communities. In the current school year, for example, my Department has allocated a total of £60,000 to support theatre companies with productions which focus specifically on issues of relevance to children in disadvantaged areas.  In 1997, £15,000 was allocated to a theatre group which focuses on <Col N="199" /> anti-bullying.  My Department also supports the Ark in Temple Bar, Dublin by seconding two primary teachers on a full time basis to work with the director of the Ark in organising activities in drama and the arts for children.  Schools are encouraged to participate <Col N="200" /> in the activities of the Ark and they do so on a regular basis.  Very recently, my Department has become involved, with the Arts Council and the Gulbenkian Foundation, in funding the creation of a schools' liaison officer in the National Theatre (the Abbey).</P>
