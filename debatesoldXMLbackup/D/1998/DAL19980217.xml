      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the recent National Economic and Social Forum report which said that dramatic increases in wealth creation in our economy should not distract attention from our continuing problems of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government outlined in its press statement at the time of the publication of the recent NESF report that it welcomed the various recommendations of the forum and appreciated the important contribution it has made through its wide-ranging reports and opinions, as evidenced by its work over the past four years.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the importance of addressing the continuing problems as outlined by the Deputy.  A number of measures are in place to do so, as outlined in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium, Partnership 2000 and the National Anti-Poverty Strategy.  These are monitored on an ongoing basis and the various social partners are involved in the process.  The Government has also taken specific measures to ensure programmes and resources are targeted directly at areas of disadvantage to combat the problems of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion.  I refer in particular to the decision to establish a Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion, which I am chairing, and the new co-ordinated approach to supporting young people at risk in disadvantaged areas, which I announced on 21 January.</P>
      <P>It is important to note the NESF also commented in its recent report that it remains &ldquo;satisfied and encouraged with responses received and the actions taken by successive Governments on its recommendations&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that as part of the process of globalisation the gap <Col N="382" /> between the top decile of incomes and the bottom decile of incomes has widened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People who find themselves either in disadvantaged communities or in disadvantaged circumstances continue to have ongoing difficulties.  However, on a global basis, particularly in the context of western countries and the various initiatives under the EU, we are ahead in some ways.  Through education, through programmes like Youthreach, the antipoverty programmes, the drugs task force, Breaking the Cycle, the lowering of the pupil-teacher ratio etc., we have begun tackling the problems.  It is an area where we can never do enough, but there has been a genuine attempt for some years to try to assist those communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach consulted with the members of the National Economic and Social Forum about the proposed changes in the taxation of credit union members' dividends and deposits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter does not arise on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has had a number of meetings with the League of Credit Unions and matters of some contention have been resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to carry out an audit of the recent budget, measuring it against the targets outlined in the national anti-poverty strategy which aimed to reduce the levels of absolute poverty in society over a period of years?  Would he agree that one way of ensuring that those targets are reached is to ensure that when we make decisions on taxation and social welfare, health and housing, the targets set out in the national anti-poverty strategy are borne in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to bear them in mind, whether by way of audit or otherwise.  They represent a co-ordinated response to the problems, and it is important that all Departments, not just any one Department, should take account of them.  The national anti-poverty strategy is a concerted effort to co-ordinate the tackling of the problems, and there is relevant action in all Departments, particularly in relation to education, poverty and disadvantage. Those are actions I totally concur with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach and his Department not collect information on income distribution?  Is it not the case that the gap between the 10 per cent on the highest incomes and the 10 per cent on the lowest incomes in our society is widening, and that can be statistically shown to be so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office gathers this information which is regularly <Col N="383" /> reported to the House.  As economies prosper there are always disparities between a proportion of those earning higher incomes and those on welfare.  There has been additional expenditure to assist the less well off as economic advancement has taken place.  Such additional spending cannot take place when there is no economic growth.  It is proper that the resources of those doing better are used to help the less well off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Members on all sides understand that point.  However, I am asking the Taoiseach about information held in his Department. Those at the top of the income scale are receiving global salaries and are benefiting from reductions in capital gains tax and special tax breaks.  Is it not the case that the gap between them and the people at the bottom is getting statistically and measurably wider?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That process will continue as a result of the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Taoiseach knows the facts.  He may not have expected to be asked this question so I will not press it any further.  However, will the Taoiseach obtain the facts on income distribution and let me know that what I am saying is correct &mdash; the gap is widening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton can obtain any CSO information he wishes.  I have answered the question.  It is clear that those at the top of the economy are moving ahead.  The Minister for Finance has used the Finance Bill to tighten up on capital allowances which have been used for a number of years by those on high incomes to shelter from taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know that the Taoiseach is aware of the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the latest statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept a brief supplementary question from Deputy De Rossa.  The House will have ample opportunity to discuss these matters later today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not be in the House to discuss these matters.  He is ultimately responsible as he is in charge of the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with social exclusion and drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should put his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to audit the budget in terms of its achieving the targets set out in the national anti-poverty strategy which aims to reduce absolute poverty over a period of years?  This task needs to be undertaken if we are serious about implementing <Col N="384" /> these targets.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is insufficient to allocate additional resources to assist the least well off when the economy is going well?  We have to allocate resources to break the cycle of disadvantage which can be traced from generation to generation.  If the economy goes into a downturn, those who are helped by a little extra expenditure will be even worse off unless the cycle of disadvantage is broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy will be monitored against economic progress. As far as the second question is concerned, of course it is not just a matter of resources.  We must ensure that those resources are used properly. A great deal has been done in the 1990s to assist areas suffering from long-term disadvantage. There have been improvements to the local environment and housing.  There have also been improvements in education such as Breaking the Cycle, lowering of pupil-teacher ratios and assisting community activity.  All of these initiatives are assisting and this is why long-term unemployment has fallen dramatically in recent years as a result of favourable economic conditions.  As long as there are problems of disadvantage and areas of social exclusion it will be necessary to continue this.  In reply to Deputy Bruton I made the point that switching resources from taxes collected towards areas of welfare and community grants is something that should continue.  We are not doing too badly in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Competitiveness Council, established in May 1997 by the last Government, will submit its first report shortly. The report will give a review of Ireland's competitive position and has two purposes, namely, to identify priority areas for action to improve competitiveness and to provide reference material for policy makers to help further refine the actions needed in all areas of policy to improve Ireland's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>It is expected the report will cover four main areas of action, namely, human resource development, business services, infrastructure and public finance and administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy with that. The Members of the National Competitiveness Council have put much work over a relatively short period into this report in terms of analytical research and the submissions from agencies with which it has met.  I am not sure of the precise date, but the report will be available as soon as possible and I will suggest to the Whips that it be debated in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>I do not know whether the report will include such references.  I have seen the text of the report and have had some discussions about it with the chairman of the council. The council is endeavouring to ensure the report is as comprehensive as possible, probably covering even more areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The council is looking at all aspects of competitiveness, including skills availability, education, economic and monetary union and its effect on the costs base, and the major issue of salaries and wages which represent 25 per cent of total input.  The council will also examine taxation, trade diversification, investment in technology and all matters it believes will effect competitiveness in the future.  The council has endeavoured to look at the policy issues which we all must examine over the next decade.</P>

      <P>The Government has no plans at present to mark the 400th anniversary of the Battle of Kinsale in 2001.  Events to commemorate the battle are, however, being considered locally by a sub-committee of Kinsale Urban District Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the event will be marked locally, but since the Battle of Kinsale was a turning point in Irish and European history &mdash; it was followed by the flight of the earls from <Col N="387" /> Ulster in 1607 &mdash; it should be remembered nationally.  I suggest a postage stamp should be issued to commemorate the Battle of Kinsale of 1601.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

It should be borne in mind that it is a matter of disappointment for those who travel, particularly from Tyrone, Derry and Donegal, that no effort is made to commemorate this historic battle in which the O'Neills and O'Donnells were involved.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the disappointment of those such as myself whose forefathers were involved in this battle that no commemoration is planned?  I am not speaking in personal terms, but people from places such as Tyrone and Donegal are disappointed at the lack of plans to commemorate the event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the multi-party negotiations have been proceeding in Dublin Castle yesterday and today.  It had been intended that the session in Dublin would focus on strands two and three.  Most delegations had tabled written responses to the questions set out in the paper on strand two jointly presented by the two Governments in Lancaster House on 27 January and one delegation had responded to the joint paper on strand three matters tabled by the two Governments the same day.  It had been envisaged that the independent chairmen would bring forward a paper based on the responses by delegations, as a basis for the discussions foreseen for Dublin.</P>
      <P>In the event, the proceedings in Dublin have been dominated by discussion of the implications, if any, for Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations arising from killings that took place in Belfast last week.  These murders were condemned at the time both by me and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Government, and I reiterate now our abhorrence of these and of all the murders that have taken place since some time before Christmas.  There is an established procedure for dealing with issues of this kind when they are raised.  This procedure is currently in train and, as the Irish Government, together with the British one, will be called upon to rule on the issue arising, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on these matters today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While extremely conscious of the gravity of the matters just mentioned, it is a source of intense frustration to me and the Government that the session in Dublin has so far been overshadowed in this way.  I would not wish to understate the breadth of the differences between the positions publicly enunciated by the various participants, for example, in the papers recently submitted to the chairmen.  In spite of the public positions, ongoing dialogue with the parties suggested that there was a reasonable prospect of common ground being found as the negotiations approached their final stages.  The Government will continue to use every endeavour to make such a prospect a reality and to find an accommodation <Col N="390" /> that can provide the basis for a fair and durable settlement.</P>
    <P>I hosted a reception for the participants in Dublin Castle on Monday evening to which appropriate representatives of opposition parties were invited.</P>
    <P>As I have previously stated, the Government is carrying forward work on elaborating its views on the details of a settlement.  Deputies will be aware that the general practice in the negotiations has been for the two Governments to act jointly, including in the presentation of any papers. Whether and when to present the results of the work under way will be determined by the Governments in the light of progress in the three strands.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government firmly believes that if it is to secure the necessary support, the settlement must include a North-South ministerial council and North-South bodies with executive decision and implementation powers. This will obviously have significant implications for the way we do our business in this State, in view of the need for agreement between the two sides of the council on the action to be taken in the areas for which it and the associated all-island implementation bodies will have responsibility.  However, it would be premature and not particularly helpful at this stage in the negotiations to enter into detailed debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>The question as to how the settlement is to be put to referendum is currently under consideration. There are a number of complex issues to be addressed.  I do not propose to comment further pending the completion of our consideration of this matter.</P>
    <P>I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Marjorie Mowlam MP, on 5 February. We had a useful discussion which focused on developments in the multi-party talks and we discussed how we might accelerate progress in the talks.  Both Governments remain committed to the achievement, as speedily as possible, of a balanced settlement, based on agreement, to be put to the people in referendums, North and South, by May.  I also met Dr. Mowlam last evening and we discussed current developments.</P>
    <P>I replied to Mr. Trimble's letter on 10 February. I do not propose to discuss my response other than to make the point that I do not accept the parallel he has drawn between the events in question and the new inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday.</P>
    <P>I have been in recent contact with both President Clinton and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and I welcome their recent affirmation at their meeting of their continuing commitment to peace in Northern Ireland.  I join them in condemning the recent sectarian killings and urging all of the parties to show their vision, forbearance and determination to succeed.  The programme for my visit to North America is being finalised.  I am, however, planning to visit Toronto and Washington <Col N="391" /> DC during my trip where I will meet President Clinton.</P>
    <P>I met Mr. Alexander Downer, the Australian Foreign Minister, on 4 February.  We had a very positive meeting covering a number of issues.  I was pleased to be able to inform him of the progress in the multi-party talks and to thank him for Australia's continued contribution to the International Fund for Ireland, in particular, the contribution of $1.5 million for 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is right that the two Governments should act jointly on all matters in the talks?  In that context, in what way and through what channels has the Irish Government examined the forensic evidence which, it is suggested, links the IRA to recent killings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view and experience to date that the two Governments should act together.  With regard to the recent killings, the Garda Síochána and the RUC communicate and meet regularly.  That has also happened with regard to current issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in a matter of this importance it is critical that not only the right decision is made but that the Government is seen to take that decision in the most thorough fashion, so that no suggestion that the Governments have not taken the words and evidence seriously can be adduced?  Has the Government considered my suggestion that perhaps an Anglo-Irish inter-governmental conference under the Anglo-Irish Agreement might be useful in so far as it would allow the Irish Government to put questions to the Chief Constable of the RUC on the forensic evidence?  The Irish Government could be seen, therefore, to satisfy itself in a formal way about the evidence, rather than simply relying on information conveyed to it secondhand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his helpful suggestions and I accept the spirit in which they are made.  Since the middle of last week the Governments have been in contact at every level &mdash; Taoiseach to Prime Minister, Secretary of State to Minister for Foreign Affairs, the RUC to the Garda Síochána and officials at all levels &mdash; where these matters have been followed through.</P>
      <P>I have been briefed about all the data on which I wished to be satisfied directly by the British Prime Minister.  I have asked him the obvious questions and all the questions which were put to me.  I have not been in touch with the RUC.  With regard to the inter-governmental conference, it is necessary for the Garda Síochána to meet the RUC and put the relevant technical questions. There was such a meeting recently and those matters were discussed.  Arising from that, the Garda Síochána is of the belief there is a case to answer.</P>

      <P>Question No. 13 refers to the proposed referendum or plebiscite.  It is the intention of the two Governments to have an agreed document completed by 1 May.  It is then intended to put the contents of that document to a referendum or plebiscite in both parts of this island.  Is it the intention of the two Governments to hold the referendum on the same day in both parts of the island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There is a group examining the operation of such a plebiscite.  There were useful exchanges on the subject in the House last week and I have forwarded these to the group so its members may be made aware of the views of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House the readmission procedures for a party suspended from the negotiation process? The UDP was suspended and there are rumours they may be readmitted in the not too distant future.  The current indictment of Sinn Féin may result in its suspension.  Given the need to have the widest possible participation in these talks &mdash; a matter I raised last week in relation to the DUP &mdash; will the Taoiseach indicate the mechanisms for the readmission of parties who re-establish their commitment to the Mitchell principles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The determination process is clearly set out and is based on what is written in that determination and the attitude of the Governments to it.  What happened some weeks ago has changed what is on the agenda now.  The Governments are anxious these talks stay comprehensive and inclusive, particularly as we move towards the final weeks or months of negotiating an agreement.  I told the British Prime Minister that is still my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate and regrettable, but not our fault, that these matters arose.  The Governments did not kill anybody and they want these matters dealt with in a way in which everyone can be allowed state their views on behalf of the people they represent.  We will endeavour to deal with this but the Government cannot set aside the basis of the Mitchell principles.  The basis of the ground rules document is that we are against the killing of any person for any reason in any circumstances. The fact that we are against violence is the fundamental basis of what we are trying to achieve.  I acknowledge that representatives at the talks are of like mind.  However, we must follow what was agreed and that to which people have committed.  I argued that people should be included in these talks on an inclusive basis, in <Col N="393" /> circumstances where they adhere to the Mitchell principles.</P>
    <P>Suspension will be determined, as in the last case and possibly, as due process must take place, in any subsequent case, by what is agreed in determination between both Governments, based on evidence and statements put before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the &ldquo;no claim, no blame&rdquo; tactic could undermine the Mitchell principles unless the Governments are willing to make a clear decision on the evidence available as to whether they have been demonstrably dishonoured?  Will the Governments have to make that difficult but necessary decision if the Mitchell principles are to be sustained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Due process must take place but the Governments must make that decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to elaborate on the Taoiseach's reply on the information given to the Garda.  The Taoiseach may have heard his predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds, this morning cast doubt on the veracity of reports from the RUC, giving sustenance to those who discredit any opinion of the Chief Constable that the people charged with the murder are activists in IRA-Sinn Féin.  Is the Taoiseach stating that, before the Irish Government makes a decision in concert with the British Government, the Garda will be satisfied about the scientific objectivity of any forensic evidence and the Irish Government will take action on foot of clear professional advice based on scientific evidence evaluated by the Garda and not rely exclusively on the word of the RUC?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Garda give me a report on their judgment I will accept it, but I cannot say what precisely they do to arrive at that judgment.</P>
      <P>I went to great lengths on a number of occasions in recent days to ask the British Prime Minister every conceivable question that was put to me from all sources and they were received with great patience.  I have had a lot of dealings with the British Prime Minister and I take him at his word regarding what he has been told.  He understands what we might say and the questions that might be asked.  He said this in some sense publicly and in other discussions and I believe that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his earlier reply to my supplementary, but he did not address the specific point regarding readmission to the talks of parties suspended or that may be suspended.  If we are to achieve the inclusiveness that we would all like &mdash; although <Col N="394" /> circumstances may dictate otherwise &mdash; in what way will the parties who seek readmission be dealt with?  Will the procedure that applies for the indictment of parties apply in those circumstances? Will the decision be made by both Governments and will parties involved in the negotiations have an opportunity to express their views on the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The due process is outlined in the ground rules documents and that mechanism must be followed.  As was said previously, this may arise several times, but I hope it does not. The Governments can also indicate their position based on what might be said.  If they put forward precise details, they would have to be reflected on.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to &ldquo;a case to answer&rdquo;.  There is a case to answer, but by whom?  There was also reference to objectivity.  There is very little objectivity, scientific or otherwise, in this matter.  I assure the Taoiseach and Members that as an elected Sinn Féin Member I am here to represent the people of Cavan and Monaghan, with the support of 11,531 votes, a mandate equalled by only a handful of other Members.  I intend to stand here for peace and justice in solidarity with my elected colleagues who today are fighting a fraudulent indictment that has been laid against us at Dublin Castle.  Will the Taoiseach disassociate himself from this charade and stand up for the rights of those Irish citizens for whom he is responsible and who are today being put beyond the pale? Will he agree to a special debate today on the crisis in the peace process?  I urge agreement from all sides on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is the IRA.  In regard to the second part, a process is taking place elsewhere to which all parties in this House &mdash; including I think the Deputy's party &mdash; subscribed.  I am pleased to hear him express what a number of his negotiators have said to me in recent days, that they are prepared to see the process worked through.  Part of the process is that certain rules have to be worked through and I hope all that will happen in the next few months.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach talks about working within specific rules will he recognise that one of the fundamental rules is the basis of evidence in relation to any charge against any constituent participant group within the talks process?  Is it the case that no such evidence has been produced against Sinn Féin, an independent political party with a mandate throughout the length and breadth of the island and which has played a constructive and courageous role in the formation and work of this process to date?</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: The expulsion of Sinn Féin could give rise to an extremely dangerous situation, leave a dangerous vacuum and play into the hands of extreme sectarians responsible for the horrific murders of the past two months. Where the leaders of political parties associated with paramilitary organisations publicly call for the ceasefires to continue, and given that the majority of people who vote for those political parties do not condone the murders but condemn them, is it counterproductive to move towards exclusion?  Is it the case that any freelance member of the IRA or the UDA who wants to scupper the process of reconciliation need only commit another murder to scupper the talks?  This matter could be advanced by an explosion of the monumental hypocrisy on all sides.  Some of those who are vehemently calling for extremes have, in the past, given comfort to paramilitaries.  Also the British Government is now prepared to drop fearsome weapons which will murder thousands of innocent Iraqis at the behest of President Clinton.</P>

      <P>I wish these matters were otherwise.  I worked hard all last week to prepare <Col N="396" /> for the talks at Dublin Castle this week and remain committed to inclusive talks with practically all parties to explore their positions under strand two.  Unfortunately, there have been further deaths.  As happened when the parties met in Lancaster House two weeks ago, this has made it difficult to move forward.  Parties must abide by the rules that govern the process which is a political rather than a legal one.  We are trying to resolve the difficulties and structure a new arrangement which would follow the framework I have outlined in the House on several occasions, including Question Time.  We must abide by what we have signed up to and be consistent and fair and try to deal with crises as they arise.  When the process was initiated many years ago everybody knew that it would not be easy.  At times, it is very difficult but we must be fair to everybody and follow due process where people can express their concerns and reservations.  The two Governments must be consistent at all times so that everybody knows the ground rules.  That must happen in this case also.</P>

Will the Taoiseach agree that this is evidence that there are systematic attempts by paramilitary organisations, through punishment beatings and shootings and threats, to maintain control and exercise a form of mob rule in certain areas and that this is contrary to the Mitchell principles? Will the Taoiseach further agree that there is a need for an ongoing mechanism to monitor low level punishment beatings as well as the extreme step of considering expulsion from the talks for high level actions such as murder?</P>

During the Christmas period many Nationalists who were not known to have been involved and who were law abiding and family people were gunned down.  People in communities which have suffered so much have been trying very hard, as has Sinn Féin, to find mechanisms to move their communities away from punishment beatings.  That would be a welcome development.  The two Governments must continue to monitor the position. We cannot agree to anything that is anti-democratic or pro-violence.  We must at all times speak out against this; otherwise, there will be no law and no rules.  We must continue to do everything we can to uphold proper standards.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider a bad weather aid package for the fishing industry in view of the adverse weather conditions during the months of December 1997 and January 1998; and if his attention has been drawn to the financial hardship imposed on the fishermen.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3908/98]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House in recent weeks that I would be open to considering any substantiated case for assistance made by fishing organisations owing to losses incurred because of bad weather of exceptional severity and duration in light of Met Éireann weather data and within the parameters of EU legislation.</P>
      <P>I have to remind Deputies, however, that under EU state aid rules approval for financial assistance to the fishing sector must be obtained from the European Commission.  The Commission has consistently stated that EU funding will not be made available to compensate for bad weather. The Commission has also affirmed it opposes national compensation schemes in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to date received two formal requests for bad weather compensation from sectors of the fishing industry.  These are currently being examined by the Department.  In order to inform evaluation of and decisions on any such requests from the industry I had already requested the Department to undertake a comprehensive analysis of weather data as well as landing and sales data for <Col N="398" /> the period November 1997 to January 1998 and for comparative periods.  This analysis is under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and I have read the previous response.  I tabled this question because of the concern expressed in the fishing industry about the ongoing bad weather.  Is the Minister aware there is a precedent dating back to April 1994 when the then Minister, Deputy Andrews, pressed the Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Finance, and £5 million was allocated in similar circumstances?  If there was a precedent in 1994 to respond to the industry surely it is possible for the Government to respond to it now?  While indicating to the industry that it should respond by producing data, which does not give rise to any difficulty, the Minister should also respond to it.  Articles 8 and 9 of the regulations state member states may grant financial aid to ensure an equitable standard of living for the population who depend on fishing for their livelihood.  The Minister might reconcile that statement in the regulations with EU policy in this area which he stated does not provide for compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the previous situation, the Commission seriously considered taking Ireland to the European Court of Justice because of the arrangements made at that time.  An amount was set aside, but the amount drawn down was considerably less.  The Commission finally withdrew its threat only towards the end of 1996 on grounds that this would not happen again.  It took a good deal of negotiation to reach that position.  Given the circumstances, we are monitoring the position to ascertain what the outcome will be from the point of view of weather conditions.  As the Deputy is aware, the weather has improved substantially in recent times and fishing has begun again.  Meteorological statistics suggest that weather conditions this winter, with the exception of December, have not been as harsh as in recent years.  Weather conditions were better than average for the period from November to January.  The current year appears to be the third best winter in the past seven years in terms of gale days on the north and south west coasts.  We are examining the sales figures to see what needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Questions were raised about why farmers get allowances and various types of compensation. There is only a limited quota available to the fishing sector.  If the quota is reached, that is as much as can be caught irrespective of when fishing takes place.  There is a certain give and take in that regard because if a fisherman fulfils his quota, he has caught all the fish he can catch.  We are looking at that and I have noted what the Deputy said.  I appreciate that December was particularly bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>In December the Department of Agriculture and Food placed an advertisement in <Col N="399" /> the newspapers asking farmers to send in submissions before 19 December if their crops were damaged by bad weather.  Those submissions will be considered by the EU Commission in March and compensation will probably be paid.  It is difficult to reconcile that with the situation in the fishing industry.  Fishermen feel similarly aggrieved because bad weather conditions have affected their incomes in what is regarded as a hazardous profession.  Such conditions have also had an impact on the white fishing fleet.  This situation is further compounded by the collapse of the herring fishing sector.  I ask the Minister to try to convince his EU colleagues that this is a problem specific to Ireland.  I am sure the fishing industry has quantified the scale and effect of the losses in its submissions to the Minister.  Perhaps he could respond positively in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concerns about the worrying state of the herring markets.  I have outlined to the House on several occasions the background to and the global nature of the problems facing the industry.  I am glad to have this opportunity to update the House further on my initiatives to address the immediate crisis for fishermen and processors involved in the herring fishery. These initiatives focus on tackling the medium to long-term structural, operational, market and management issues which are at the heart of the present crisis.</P>
      <P>The main underlying global factor is oversupply and changing trends on the key Japanese herring roe and European herring flap markets which are the key outlets for Irish herring exports.  There is ample evidence of a global herring market collapse resulting in depressed prices for traditional suppliers.  This is due to high output in the Canadian herring fisheries and the re-emerging Atlanto Scandian herring fishery from which over one million tonnes was produced last year.  Norway, in particular, has led the market penetration of Atlanto Scandian herring and continues to off-load an unprecedented level of supplies into EU and eastern European markets.  The Japanese herring roe market, where Irish herring producers have developed a valuable niche in recent years, is similarly suffering from over supply and low prices, exacerbated by the downturn in the Japanese economy and signs of long-term decline in the traditional consumer market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="400" /> The global herring commodity market, which is a naturally volatile sector, is going through a particularly difficult cycle.  Little change is foreseen in the short to medium term.  The extent and impact of the actions which we can take at national level must be set in this global supply and demand context.  It has been clear for some time, however, that a range of structural, operational and quality improvements are required in the herring industry if our producers are to maintain a market presence and become more competitive in a tough international environment.</P>
    <P>A hard collective look at all aspects of the sector was clearly needed.  Having consulted with the industry, and at its request, I set up a task force last December, representative of all relevant interests, to comprehensively address the issues. I have mandated the task force to assess all the options for better management and marketing of Irish herring, taking account of global factors and trends and all relevant domestic factors across the supply, processing and marketing chain.  I have asked the task force to recommend concrete measures to tackle identified short-term difficulties designed to bring about the necessary medium to long-term change.  It will also advise on the financial, sectoral and management implications of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have asked the task force to report to me by the end of March &mdash; a demanding but necessary deadline because of the critical situation which faces the industry.  The task force, which comprises regional and national representatives of the herring fishing industry, processors and exporters as well as BIM, the Marine Institute and the Department, has been working intensively on all aspects of the brief since its first meeting on 22 December last.  It has already made interim recommendations to me on the need for urgent action at EU level to reduce the current level of preferential access by non member states and on the priority need for enhanced herring stock assessment and survey programmes by the Marine Institute in 1998.  I have accepted and taken immediate initiatives on these interim recommendations.</P>
    <P>The task force has already signalled to me that funding will be needed to back up its emerging findings and recommendations on short to medium-term programmes needed to address long-term structural, quality, handling and marketing deficiencies in the herring sector.  These will be geared primarily around improving the competitive position of the catching, processing and exporting sector.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving and taking forward the task force's report and recommendations next month which will constitute a comprehensive agreed package of measures designed to address the short-term difficulties through systematic tackling of the underlying problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and for setting up the task force in late December when the collapse in the herring sector <Col N="401" /> was flagged.  As the Minister is aware, herring fishery in the Celtic Sea is due to conclude at the end of February and the task force is to report to the Minister by the end of March.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned addressing the short-term difficulties.  I am sure he meant improving the quality of herring and fishing vessels.  What financial assistance will be available for such improvements?  I am sure the Minister is aware &mdash; and this probably compounds what I said about the weather problem &mdash; that if herring prices have collapsed from £200 to £120 per tonne, a decrease of £80 per tonne, it is probably uneconomic for many fishermen, particularly those in the south west, to fish in the traditional fishery of the Celtic Sea.  With regard to the Minister's short-term response, I hope it will give some appeasement to those who fish for herring and that it will result in improved prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Deputy.  This is clearly the objective of the task force.  The task force is substantial with wide, practical representation including the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, the fishery co-operatives, the Celtic Sea fish processors, IBEC and representatives of the Celtic Sea herring industry in addition to various others.  This is a major undertaking which will be carried out over a fairly short timescale.  In the meantime I am conscious of the difficulties faced by the whitefish fleet and additional measures are being taken in the budget which will give incentives in that regard.  I hope to come up with a reasonably good grant-aid package which will help also.  I assure the Deputy that the task force is examining measures to tackle the short-term requirements.  A number of recommendations have been made already which we are following up, particularly with the Commission. This is a major local issue but it is also a global one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the task force, whose membership encompasses all sections of the fishing community, what reassurance can the Minister give fishermen involved in herring fishing that its findings will lead to an improvement in the overall price per tonne?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force will be in a position to see that measures can be taken, from an Irish point of view, to improve the return to fishermen. The global problem will involve the European Union and we are already making some representations on behalf of the task force to the Presidency and to the Commission.  They are interim measures.  I believe fishermen are happy with the task force because it is effective and is dealing with the underlying problem.  They know it will be in a position to tackle problems in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully committed to supporting and facilitating the diversification and sustainable expansion of the Irish aquaculture industry into a range of new species.  Such developments reflect the global trend in aquaculture where production technology and research and development into new species is developing at a rapid rate, notably in Norway but also in Scotland, Spain and the Far East as well as North America.</P>
      <P>In the Irish context, the pilot development of new high value finfish species such as halibut and turbot will facilitate diversification, supplement salmon farming and will have significant export potential when commercialised production comes onstream.  The world market for quality seafood is continuing to expand, and with the continued downward pressure on fish stocks it is clear that aquaculture production will continue to grow to meet the international and EU seafood deficit.</P>
      <P>The pioneering trials into halibut and turbot at Oilean Chléire by the co-operative and Údarás na Gaeltachta have demonstrated the technical feasibility of production in Irish conditions.  This is in spite of the fish health problems experienced last year which all concerned have been working to overcome and move beyond.</P>
      <P>The next step is to assess the economic feasibility of production on a commercial scale, taking account of developments in Scotland and Norway. My Department is working with Údarás na Gaeltachta, BIM, the Marine Institute and the industry itself in pursuing the necessary development, investment and scientific strategies to progress these initiatives.  In addition to halibut and turbot I can also confirm that work is ongoing into commercialising production of abalone, sea urchins and eels, where the technical challenges inherent in ongrowing such species are considerable but are being overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that techniques for farming cod are being actively developed in Norway and Scotland although as yet there have been no initiatives in this regard in Ireland.  I have no doubt that the technical challenges of breeding cod and a range of other demersal species will be overcome in Ireland and elsewhere.  However, my initial judgment is that the economics of cod cultivation remain dubious at this stage although the ongoing depletion of cod stocks world-wide is a regrettable reality.  The decline of wild fish stocks must continue to be addressed in its own right through fishery conservation and management strategies. In the longer term cultivation of these species may well contribute to reducing the pressure on wild stocks which would be a welcome by-product <Col N="403" /> of continuing technical advances in aquaculture development.</P>

We will miss the bus, as far as Europe is concerned, in regard to the advancement of aquaculture.  The Minister stated that abalone, sea urchins, eels, etc. are under examination in his Department but there is no evidence on the ground that we are producing any volume of those fish, which carry a lucrative tag in the markets.

      <P>Will the Minister try to encourage a major conglomerate such as Marks &amp; Spencer to examine the feasibility of breeding cod along the western seaboard?

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important sector and the Deputy is quite right about its potential for development.  It will be one of the major developments here in the future.  It is important also that we do not miss the bus as far as the EU is concerned.  It is true that generally we are coming from behind in that regard but we are making progress speedily in the species which are cultivated here.  The introduction of new species is a different question.  The abalone is being produced here now.  This was one of the species studied by our delegation when it visited China and we followed <Col N="404" /> up on that.  The technology, which the Chinese developed over a long time and in which they are particularly expert, is being transferred to us by mutual agreement.  We have taken that step to encourage and assist the development of abalone.  I am informed that there is no cultivation of cod in Ireland, although I agree with the Deputy that it will have to be considered for the future.  Developments are taking place such as the one he mentioned by Marks &amp; Spencer.  We will see what can be done in that area.  The Marine Institute is interested in that matter and is pursuing it.</P>
      <P>Only two companies are involved in the cultivation of halibut and turbot.  There were difficulties with the Oileán Cléire co-op, about which I am concerned.  It carried out experiments and put a sizeable investment into it but ran into difficulties. I am keeping in close touch with the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, together with Údarás na Gaeltachta and the co-operative itself.  We have scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to look at the matter.  I had discussions with them a few weeks ago and I said I would arrange a meeting at which the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, will also be present.  The Cape Clear co-op is owned in part by Údarás na Gaeltachta so it is directly involved. We are trying to progress the matter</P>

There was an unfortunate serious viral outbreak in turbot stocks which meant they had to be destroyed as a precautionary measure.  The production of halibut, however, has been very successful &mdash; almost surprisingly so in the warmer waters of that area compared to the north of Scotland. That has been particularly encouraging.  The halibut produced has been very good and has been selling in Dublin.  Wrights of Marino have a joint operation with the Oileán Cléire co-op and sell for it.  There are good prospects in that operation and I will encourage it in any way I can. <Col N="405" /></P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns within the sawmilling industry as a result of his decision to approve Coillte Teoranta to take over a company (details supplied) thus creating an unfair economic advantage for Coillte Teoranta to the detriment of the private sawmill industry in this country.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3904/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of the concerns expressed by the sawmilling industry on the proposed purchase by Coillte Teoranta of an 80 per cent stake in the Balcas Group, the sawmilling company based in Enniskillen.</P>
      <P>When we were considering this proposal, I met the Irish Timber Council, the representative body for the sawmilling sector, on two occasions.  The council also met the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Byrne, and separately the Minister for Finance.  I am satisfied that the council was afforded every possible opportunity to make its views known and that these views were given the fullest consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government agreed in December last, subject to certain safeguards, to approve the proposed purchase.  These safeguards related to the independence of Coillte's electronic log auctions, the Balcas share of log supplies and further development of forward contracts between Coillte and the sawmillers.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the safeguards was to meet concerns expressed by the Irish Timber Council, particularly in relation to the independence of the log pricing system.  I should add that the approval given by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Finance, relates primarily to our responsibilities as shareholder in Coillte Teoranta as well as my overall responsibility for the rational development of the forestry sector.</P>
      <P>While in the exercise of these functions we were, of course, mindful of competition aspects, these are primarily a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Her consent is also required in accordance with the requirements of the Mergers and Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts 1978 to 1996.  I understand that she has sought the views of the Competition Authority on the proposed acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's reply, I am still not convinced that this matter has been dealt with adequately.  It was dealt with expeditiously when the House was in recess for Christmas and the decision was taken by the Cabinet at that stage.</P>

      <P>A question please, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am questioning the decision because it has created a monopoly in the timber <Col N="406" /> industry.  Is the Minister aware that 20 per cent of Coillte's logs are shipped unprocessed outside the State?  This causes a serious shortage of logs for southern Irish sawmills.  Furthermore, Coillte seems to have set its own reserve prices on logs. Does the Minister not agree that creates a monopoly? Once Coillte has obtained an overriding position for producing and selling logs and timber, it can dictate prices to other timber producing firms.  The system is completely unfair and must be redressed.  Does the Minister think a monopoly has already been created by giving Coillte the position it now enjoys?  I would welcome the Minister's further comments on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously if the Government felt it was creating a monopoly it would not have taken the decision.  The adequacy of the situation was considered for some time by Coillte, for whom independent reports were undertaken. When the matter came to Government I asked many questions and I delayed its progress because I wanted to be assured about various aspects.  I met twice with the Irish Timber Council and a great deal of consideration was given to the matter.  I was particularly concerned about the independence of Coillte's electronic log auction system.  It is generally agreed that system is working well, but others buying and using the logs are concerned about it.  The fact it is within Coillte's control is itself questionable.  For that reason, I insisted that it be seen to be independent and it will ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This is probably the most significant issue.</P>
      <P>There will be a problem with oversupply of logs in about eight years' time from the private sector as well as Coillte.  We should prepare now to ensure we will be exporting by that time.  Coillte is doing that and is following the strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector approved by Government and published in 1996.  That report, following an in-depth analysis of the Irish forestry sector, acknowledged the commercial logic of Coillte's corporate development strategy which was approved by the previous and current Government.  Coillte, a private commercial company established by Government and the Oireachtas, is preparing for the future and it is especially interested in exporting.</P>
      <P>As regards the possibility of monopoly, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has, as we expected, referred the proposal to the Competition Authority to assess its suitability under the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, and the authority will give its findings on the proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Price is a key issue as is ensuring supply.  It must be ensured that the supply is not entirely exported.  That is why conditions are built in concerning the Balcas share of log supply and the further development of forward contracts between Coillte and sawmillers.  These two conditions and the independent electronic log auctions <Col N="407" /> are key measures and are part of the Government's decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that, as part of the acquisition of Balcas, Coillte has acquired a sawmilling facility in Estonia?  Is it the Government's policy to encourage Coillte to develop its capacity outside the State?  To what extent was that a factor in the Minister's decision to approve Coillte's acquisition of Balcas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It does involve a facility in Estonia, and the Government expects Coillte to develop that in line with its commercial mandate.  That is the basic point: the company now has a commercial mandate and is starting to operate outside this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the information the Minister conveyed to the House.  In December 1996, 79,769 tonnes of logs were offered with 100 per cent sold.  A further offer of 41,923 tonnes was made in the same month, of which 64 per cent was sold.  In the corresponding month last year, 58,158 tonnes of logs were offered with only 71 per cent sold.  Only 35 per cent of a second offer of 23,137 tonnes was sold. This is a dramatic reduction of 33 per cent in the logs offered to the Irish timber industry in 12 months.  Does the Minister think that is a step in the right direction?  Coillte now has the opportunity of doing what it likes with the small timber industries.  Will the Minister ensure small sawmill operators receive an ample supply of logs from Coillte?  Were he to do that, I would be satisfied. I see the sawmill industry foundering for lack of raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem with supply and it will exist for some years until the private sector plantings come on stream.  Coillte is planting substantially for the future.  There was a significant drop in planting last year, but it is expected it will increase.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, has responsibility for it.  Various factors affected planting last year, but we hope it will increase this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem in terms of supply and that is why it is so important the auction system be cleared.  I have had numerous discussions with the Irish Timber Council and others and they believe the auction system is, under current circumstances, the fairest way of operating. In the new circumstances, it is my responsibility to ensure it is seen to be independent and to act independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> As regards the future of the industry and rationalisation within it, such a need has existed for some time and previous reports have stated this.  There is no doubt that, with changing times and international price competition, small sawmills will come under pressure.  As part of the Balcas discussions, Forbairt has been asked to examine the situation in the context of the structure of the industry.  It is clear a relatively small number of large operators will modernise considerably and will survive for the future.  Some small operators will survive in niche markets. However, it is recognised there is a competitive time ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the consideration, if any, he has given to the safety and security of fishing boats while in port.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern that fishermen should be able to use port facilities safely and securely.  While primary responsibility for the protection of private property rests with the owners, it is essential the relevant harbour authorities and boat owners work in co-operation to ensure fishing vessels are safeguarded as far as practically possible from vandalism or theft.</P>
      <P>In the case of the five fishery harbour centres directly managed by my Department, I have instructed that security matters are to be kept under regular review by the harbour masters in consultation with the local harbour users committees and enhanced arrangements put in place when identified as necessary.  No major difficulties have been brought to my attention to date. However, in light of the recent serious incident at Howth Harbour and my review of security arrangements with the fishermen, enhanced security arrangements are being put in place at Howth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was triggered by a report in the &ldquo;Fishing News&rdquo; about the vandalism and major damage in Howth Harbour.  It reminded me that there are millions of pounds worth of fishing boats lying at quays and piers right around the country.  Would the Minister agree there should be a more concerted effort to ensure the security and safety of those vessels? Perhaps the role of harbour constables should be extended so that fishermen can sleep easy on those nights when they are in port with reasonable assurance that their boats will not be damaged or put at risk as happened in Howth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there has to be a concerted effort.  That means local users, harbourmasters and authorities must work together to try to prevent a recurrence of vandalism. <Col N="409" /> In regard to the Howth incident, I invited the fishermen to come in and we discussed the situation at length.  It was a very unusual situation. A person has been apprehended and brought before the courts.  I do not want to go into the detail of that.  However, the incident shows the extent of damage that can result from a relatively simple act of vandalism.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for protecting a boat is the owner's.  That is the technical and legal position.  There are two harbour constables employed by my Department at Howth.  They provide a security presence at certain times of the day.  Howth is a very open harbour around which there is much other leisure activity.  There is also late night entertainment in the area.  It was after such late night entertainment that the incident in question happened.  It raises a question of 24 hour security.</P>
      <P>We have agreed to install closed circuit television cameras at Howth to record and monitor the situation.  Also, we are making other arrangements to augment the security at Howth, and that is being done in co-operation with the fishermen. I have asked the harbourmasters of the other harbours to look at the situation and to come back and discuss it with the harbour users, because it is something we have to be very conscious of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand steps are now being taken in Howth, and I am very sorry for the boat owners who suffered such appalling losses.  My concern is that we should learn nationally from the experience of Howth and that there should be a heightened sense of the need for security.  The steps now being taken at Howth might be put into operation in the other centres. Will the Minister take the lead in a national sense to try to ensure that as far as possible such incidents are prevented in the future or that damage is minimised as far as possible?  The incident at Howth was a serious warning.  Let us learn from it.  That is the message I am trying to convey.  Will the Minister take urgent action nationally as a consequence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I have begun that process and I will follow it through. We have had no reports so far of serious incidents anywhere else.  Anything else that has occurred has been of a minor nature.  The two fishermen at Howth suffered very serious losses.  I was with them when the incident occurred and I conveyed our sympathy to them and my regrets about what happened, and we discussed what needs to be done for the future.  It was an exceptional situation but it highlights the fact that on a national basis we have to take a different approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the losses in Howth could run into hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Even from a purely financial point of view it would be worth the Minister's while to put a scheme together, supported by fishermen, to ensure that such an appalling incident does not <Col N="410" /> happen again and that other fishing boat owners like the two unfortunate owners at Howth will not suffer a repetition of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  We have begun that process.  The installation of cameras would be a once-off expense although they would have to be monitored, but the cost of providing manpower is quite high.  It is common in other ports around Europe for a contribution to be made by harbour users towards the cost of security. That is another issue.</P>

      <P>Funding for commercial seaports from the Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-9 is allocated through the European Regional Development Fund under the Operational Programme for Transport, the Ireland Wales Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative and the Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>Over the life of the CSF programme, some 220 million ecu will have been invested in port infrastructure of which almost 110 million ecu will come from the EU.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that the CSF Monitoring Committee decided, at a meeting on 29 July 1997, on necessary adjustments to the programme, on foot of a mid-term evaluation, to enhance the effectiveness of the CSF interventions. The main priorities identified for additional resources included, <i>inter alia</i>, the national roads network.  Reprogramming within the OPT reallocated an additional 26 million ecu of aid to the national roads infrastructure measure from within the OPT allocation as well as savings diverted from other operational programmes.</P>
      <P>It was in this context that 8 million ecu of aid was transferred from the seaports measures of the OPT to other investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> The decision making process laid down in the CSF programme is based primarily on agreement in partnership.  I have not had any correspondence with the European Commission in the matter of the reallocation of funds.</P>
    <P>There is no question that any project for which contractual commitments had been entered into will have had to be abandoned on foot of the adjusted allocation of Structural Funds for commercial seaports.</P>
    <P>The limited savings were realised by a combination of limiting the aid rate to approved projects in certain cases below the permissible 48 per cent maximum under the OPT; release of unallocated funds; withdrawal of a number of deferred projects and the surrender of the 1995-6 deflator moneys accrued to the measure.  All projects identified for support under the programme are scheduled for completion by the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The seaport measures, which are progressing as planned, are focused on projects designed to encourage and foster greater competition in all areas of maritime trade.  Recent changes in the organisation of the major ports in terms of corporatisation will make for improved response to the demands of the economy in general and port users in particular.  Recent investment programmes have reduced core shipping and port related charges and stimulated more productive ports which offer both a greater level and frequency of services.</P>
    <P>The strategic objective of triggering a reduction in port and shipping costs and charges of 15 per cent over the duration of the CSF programme as delineated in the programme and in Partnership 2000 has been achieved.  The extent to which further investment in ports will be necessary to meet upcoming capacity constraints and to reflect demand for new types of shipping configurations is currently being measured by an assessment study of seaport capacity funded under the Operational Programme for Transport.</P>

On 2 May the Taoiseach and the other Heads of State and Government will have the responsibility of deciding the six directors of the European Central Bank.  Has the Government developed a policy in consort with any of the member states to ensure that one of the executives is an Irish representative?  I have been frustrated in my efforts since Christmas in trying to get a response from the Government on this very important matter.  The EU Central Bank will effectively set interest rates in future for the Irish economy and for the economies of the ten other member states.  So far there has only been evasion and silence from the Government on this issue. The Taoiseach and his colleagues rather than the Minister for Finance will have to make this decision.  Does the Government have a policy on the matter?  Is there a strategy?  If there is, will it be communicated to the Members of the Oireachtas?</P>

In view of the statement made by the chairperson of the Mountjoy Prison visiting committee, will he consider speeding up the publication of that Bill and the Bill relating to the attachment of earnings?

I answered the question relating to the attachment of earnings Bill last week.  It will be some time before that Bill is published.  I know there were conflicting reports over the weekend, some of which said there were in excess of 100 prisoners being held in part of Mountjoy when the actual figure was ten.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very glad to introduce my first Finance Bill as Minister for Finance and I look forward to performing this function on many more occasions.  The Bill gives effect to the budget tax cuts, a budget which cut tax rates for one million taxpayers by two percentage points, introduced a greater degree of effective tax equity by cutting back on tax shelters and gave a fillip to productive enterprise and endeavour.  The Finance Bill also contains many technical and other changes to our tax law.</P>
      <P>The budget delivered more than £500 million in personal tax reductions for all income levels, for the elderly, the widowed and those on lower pay generally.  Taxpayers will see the benefit of this shortly when the new tax year starts on 6 April.  They would have been experiencing these benefits already if our income tax year was coterminous with the calendar year.  I have particular ideas and plans in that regard which I will deal with later.</P>
      <P>There is another first this year for the Finance Bill.  The income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax provisions refer to the newly consolidated sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.  I recently had the pleasure of meeting all the staff, the outside referees and private sector contributors who made the consolidation happen. The Taxes Consolidation Act is great testimony to the efforts of all concerned.  It is also a lasting tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, without whose lead the project would have remained an aspiration and not a reality.  I take some credit for picking up the ball last summer and completing the task of putting the Bill through the Houses.</P>
      <P>It is usual in a Second Stage speech to give a run-through of many of the individual sections of the Bill.  There is, however, this year a very detailed and extensive explanatory memorandum and a summary of the main features of the Bill was published last week.  I propose, therefore, to mention only the main areas or features of the Bill rather than give a detailed description of individual legislation.  I look forward to an interesting and good debate on this important measure.  I will be introducing further measures into the Bill on Committee Stage and I will refer to these later.</P>
      <P>The first few sections of the Bill give effect to the changes in tax rates, bands and allowances, income tax exemption limits and the increased widowed bereavement allowance announced in the budget.  It is important to point out a number of important effects of the budget package on ordinary PAYE workers: in the case of single people the gains in net take home pay range from more than 2.5 per cent to 4 per cent and for married couples with two children, the gains range from 2.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in some cases. These gains are before pay increases under Programme 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> Many workers on low pay will get more from this year's budget than they got from the 1997 budget.  For a married couple on £14,000 per annum, just under the average industrial wage, the average tax rate has dropped from more than 21 per cent in 1996-97 to under 17 per cent in the forthcoming 1998-99 tax year.  For a single person also on £14,000, the corresponding drop in average tax rates is six percentage points, from 28.2 per cent in 1996-97 to 22.4 per cent in 1998-99. At the same time, I have cut back substantially on certain well used tax shelters to ensure a fairer distribution of the tax burden.  This is hardly the action of a Government portrayed by some Members opposite as cutting capital gains tax simply to enrich the better off.</P>
    <P>The income tax provisions in Chapter 2 of Part I of the Bill contain a number of anti-avoidance measures.  Section 8 is intended to counter tax avoidance arrangements relating to the commencement rules for taxing the profits or gains of trades or professions.  Under current rules, some firms can engineer a situation where profits in the second year of assessment can fall out of charge. Action is being taken to prevent this.  Section 11 is a further anti-avoidance measure to remove the risk of certain individuals moving assets offshore to avoid tax.  This arises from a recent UK court case which cast doubt on the effectiveness of its tax law on which our 1974 legislation in this area was modelled.  Section 10 improves the tax reliefs available for the purchase by employees of new shares in their company by reducing the minimum holding period for relief from five to three years.</P>
    <P>It also clears up an anomaly whereby, if shares were sold by an individual, this single disposal could, in certain cases, lead to a withdrawal of BES tax relief, approved profit sharing scheme tax relief and relief on the purchase of new shares by employees.  Section 10 will ensure that such a double or triple hit will not occur where tax relief under one of the schemes falls to be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Chapter 3 of Part I deals with various aspects of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax.  Section 12 sets out in detail how the tax relief for the employment of the long-term unemployed will apply.  This is a two-pronged initiative aimed at giving the employer an incentive to hire a person out of work for 12 months or more and affording that person an incentive to take the job offer.  I have every hope of this scheme succeeding and I will make arrangements to have it actively promoted.</P>
    <P>Section 13 sets out the conditions to be fulfilled to obtain tax relief on personal and corporate donations to disadvantaged schools.  I am glad to be able to include this imaginative suggestion for reliefs which the Minister for Education and Science put forward at budget time.  A number of new schemes of tax relief for investment are set out variously in section 15 in respect of capital allowances for airport buildings and structures, in section 17 in regard to capital allowances for the construction, extension or refurbishment of <Col N="423" /> approved nursing homes and in section 18 with regard to investment in renewal, improvement or reinstatement of vessels in the whitefish fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 27 and 28 also provide for the implementation of the budget changes on capital allowances generally and on the BES.  Given their importance both in tax equity terms and in refocusing tax reliefs more narrowly on clearly defined sectors, I propose to go into some detail on these changes.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the budget day Financial Resolution limited the amount that an individual passive investor can set off by way of capital allowances against non-rental income to £25,000 in any tax year.  This restriction applies to all types of commercial and industrial premises, with the exception of hotels which I will come to later.  This initiative was taken after it became clear that the availability of unrestricted capital allowances on these properties was being used by high income earners to reduce their tax liability on earned income by very significant amounts. The closing off of this tax shelter will have lasting effects in ensuring a fairer sharing of the tax burden.</P>
    <P>As with all measures restricting reliefs, it was necessary to provide for transitional provisions to let through certain projects well in hand or committed to by firms and investors prior to budget day.  This we did on budget night but, on further examination, a number of modifications proved to be necessary to the transitional provisions to allow borderline cases to proceed.  I announced the changes to both the main capital allowance and BES budget day provisions on 29 January.</P>
    <P>In the case of capital allowances, the amendments to the qualifying conditions for transitional reliefs are as follows: the extension of the deadline for investors to sign a binding contract for investment in the project from 1 February 1998 to 1 May 1998; the removal of the condition to have individual investors in place for the project prior to the budget for any project where the IDA had in the two year period prior to 3 December 1997 given approval for grant aid; and, the addition of a condition to allow promoters to satisfy Revenue that detailed discussions had taken place before budget day with the planning authority as an alternative to having to show receipt of a planning application by a planning authority.  These changes will allow a number of pipeline projects to proceed to completion especially a number of key projects in the Custom House Docks area.</P>
    <P>In addition, where one investor pulls out of a project after signing a contract to invest, the remaining investors will be allowed to increase their contributions to cover the funding deficit. This can be given effect to administratively by Revenue.  However, where an original investor dies, it is necessary to provide that a substitute investor will be allowed.  There is also a technical change to deal with refurbishments which were <Col N="424" /> not dealt with in the budget day transitional provisions.</P>
    <P>In the case of hotels, I announced in the budget that there would be a ring fencing of capital allowances whereby the allowances can be set off only against rental income in the case of individual passive investors.  However, this ring fence does not apply to hotels above a certain standard located in counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon or Sligo except for those hotels in designated seaside resorts in any of those counties.  Capital allowances may be set off against all the income of a passive investor's total income, without restriction, in the case of those hotels.  I see this as an important incentive to investors to fund good quality accommodation in areas which, to some extent, are off the beaten track and which have not so far shared to their full potential in the increased tourism activity in the State.  The restrictions in capital allowances apply only to outside, namely, passive, individual investors.  Owner-operators and corporate investors are not affected.</P>
    <P>The aggregate amount that a company can raise under the BES was reduced from £1 million to £250,000 with effect from budget day.  This will refocus the relief on those more risky projects which require tax relief to obtain investment in them and which would not be prime candidates for investment from other sources such as the banks.  However, to cater for projects that were well advanced prior to budget day, the budget night Financial Resolution included transitional arrangements for such BES projects.  In the case of individual companies raising their own funds the following conditions had to be met: the shares in the company had to be issued before 30 June 1998; the company had to prove to the Revenue Commissioners that before budget day it had the intention to raise money under the BES; and, in addition, certain companies also needed to have had binding contracts in place committing them to spend at least 25 per cent of the money they intended raising.  These transitional arrangements caused unintended difficulties for a small number of companies who fell foul of the requirements, particularly the 25 per cent expenditure commitment.</P>
    <P>Under the BES applicable up to budget day, any company wishing to raise in excess of £250,000 required a certificate from a certifying agency, for example, Forbairt, to the effect that the project would create or save jobs.  This required the submission of a detailed business plan.  On this basis and in order to ease the transitional problems I decided to extend the transitional arrangements as follows: projects that had been certified prior to 3 December 1997 by a development agency will be able to raise the amount for which they were certified up to the maximum limit of £1 million.  The need for binding contracts will not apply in these cases.</P>
    <P>The deadline for the issue of shares to investors will be extended in all cases from 30 June 1998 to 30 September 1998.  These changes will cater for <Col N="425" /> many current projects affected by the budget change.</P>
    <P>The BES reduction to £250,000 also affected the seed capital scheme.  The seed capital scheme is aimed at assisting individuals who give up employment to start their own business.  The scheme provides a refund of PAYE paid in the five years prior to setting up one's own business. Seed capital projects can also seek BES moneys. To ensure that the budget day change does not impact unduly on these new start-up projects, I decided to provide for the Bill to allow seed capital projects to raise £500,000 with no more than £250,000 of the £500,000 being raised under the BES.  This hybrid approach fuses the good elements of both schemes into one focused approach.</P>
    <P>Section 29 extends the relevant contracts tax &mdash; RCT &mdash; system to the poultry processing trade and certain haulage operations in the meat industry generally.  The RCT system at present relates to payments to subcontractors in the construction, red meat processing and forestry sectors and is commonly referred to as the C2 or C45 system. Under this system, where a principal contractor makes a payment to an uncertified contractor who does not hold a C2 certificate, he or she is required to deduct relevant contracts tax from those payments at the rate of 35 per cent.  The system is essentially an anti-evasion measure designed to ensure the deduction of tax which might otherwise not be collected.  There is an essential issue of what is subcontracting and what is actual employment liable to PAYE.  The Revenue Commissioners have issued guidelines to the industry setting out the criteria established by the courts under which a person may be regarded as an employee as distinct from a self-employed subcontractor.</P>
    <P>Principal contractors and subcontractors creating self-employment contractual arrangements must sign a declaration to the effect that these guidelines have been considered by them and that they are both satisfied that the contract created is a genuine contract of self-employment. However, if it emerges as a result of an investigation that an employment, rather than a subcontract exists and PAYE-PRSI and levies are not being deducted, the principal becomes liable for the PAYE-PRSI and levies.</P>
    <P>The operation of this system has given rise to some recent comment about its effectiveness. Revenue are currently engaged in a nationwide campaign to ensure that declarations made by principal contractors and subcontractors represent the true situation. The campaign commenced in November 1997 and the results at this stage indicate that, in the Dublin area, 74 per cent of the cases examined were correctly designated as subcontractors, leaving 26 per cent to be reclassified as employees.  Resistance to reclassification has been met from some principal contractors.  The Revenue Commissioners intend to visit every principal contractor not only to ensure compliance <Col N="426" /> with the PAYE-PRSI and levies system, but also to ensure an even-handed approach in its campaign.  In addition to this campaign, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs regularly conduct joint investigations into the construction industry through the joint investigation programme to ensure employers fully comply with the tax system and to protect the employment rights of employees.  I have dealt in detail with this matter to indicate that there is an active and integrated approach to tackling abuse in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Bill proposes certain changes to the self-assessment system.  The present arrangements for the payment of tax and the filing of returns are complicated even for tax professionals. At present, if one has an accounting year end in the current tax year &mdash; 1997-98 &mdash; preliminary tax must have been paid on 1 November 1997, the accounts and return for that year filed by 31 January 1999 and the balance of tax paid by 30 April 1999.  Thus, if one's accounting year in the 1997/98 tax year ended on 30 April 1997, the accounts for that year would not have to be filed with the Revenue Commissioners for 21 months until 31 January 1999.  If the accounting year end were 31 March 1998, the filing gap would be ten months.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring forward the filing date by two months beginning in the tax year after next, from 31 January 2000 to 30 November 1999, and to delay the payment of preliminary tax by one month from 1 November 1999 by moving that payment date forward also to 30 November so as to bring the two dates together.  There are a number of good reasons for doing so.  First, it is a simplification measure.  Second, it should assist practitioners by requiring them to examine a client's file only once in order to pay preliminary tax and file accounts in a particular year.  Third, it will help clients avoid interest charges on underpayment of preliminary taxes.</P>
    <P>At present, the amount of preliminary tax to be paid can be calculated as either 90 per cent of the estimated tax liability projected for the current tax year or 100 per cent of the previous year's tax liability.  Most taxpayers use the 100 per cent rule because of uncertainty at the time about the current year's liability.  However, given that under the current system final accounts for the previous tax year do not have to be filed until three months after the preliminary payment date, there is often no reliable figure on which to base the 100 per cent.  This leaves the taxpayer open to interest charges which can be substantial.</P>
    <P>If the account filing date for the previous year and the preliminary tax payment date for the current year were harmonised, this would greatly assist in the payment of correct preliminary tax and the avoidance of interest charges.  This is in both taxpayers' and tax advisers' interest.  To help support the change, the Revenue Commissioners are also prepared to reduce significantly the documentation that must be filed with the return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="427" /> A case has been made by accountants and advisers representing smaller practices that bringing forward the filing date by two months will cause problems.  These fears have been echoed by the associations representing the small firms sector. The fears and difficulties envisaged, while genuinely put forward, are, I believe, overstated. I am prepared, nonetheless, to make the section subject to a commencement order so as to give time for a fuller impact assessment to be made before going ahead.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, there is a clearer and simpler solution towards which we should work.  All income tax should be put on a calendar year basis.  It has been explained to me that the 6 April date arises from a time when the financial year ended on 25 March and debts fell due for payment on that quarter day.  When the calendar changed in Great Britain and Ireland from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in the mid-18th century, 11 days were dropped from the calendar.  To compensate for this, the year end payment date was deferred by 11 days from 25 March to 5 April.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to offer the view that now, over two centuries later, some change might be needed.  If the income tax year ended on 31 December, accounts could be required to be filed by, for example, 30 June following and tax paid by 30 September.</P>

      <P>I am aware the Deputy found it extremely easy to deal with them.  I look forward to the Deputy's deliberations, which can be conveyed privately or publicly to me.</P>
      <P>That change is a more rational approach and would be my ultimate aim, the year 2000 and other problems permitting.  The full practical and budgetary implications would have to be examined but I put it forward for discussion in a sensible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 37 also proposes that capital gains tax, which is collected in the tax year following the <Col N="428" /> year of assessment, should be paid in full on the preliminary tax date and not at the rate of 90 per cent of the liability as at present.  The section also proposes to put the instalment system for the payment of preliminary tax on a tax year basis in order to encourage take-up.  Only 1 per cent of self-assessed taxpayers use this facility each year. The changes to self-assessment are accompanied by reductions in the rate of interest charged by the Revenue Commissioners on overdue tax and by provision for publication of appeal commissioners' decisions to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>As part of the package, the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to reduce the number and volume of documents, certificates, returns and other paperwork required to be filed with the annual accounts.  This package of proposals is balanced and progressive and I am confident we can convince practitioners that this is the case.</P>
    <P>Another important feature in the Bill are the technical measures in section 39 and Schedule II to deal with the proposed introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999.  We can discuss these provisions in detail on Committee Stage but the thrust of the proposals is to make the change to the euro as tax neutral as possible without departing from current taxation principles.</P>
    <P>Among other measures dealt with in the Chapter are the extension of the tax relief schemes for multi-storey car parks and seaside resorts for one year to 30 June 1999 on certain conditions; improved capital allowances for farm pollution control measures; changes to the scheme of capital allowances for certain third level educational projects; revised and extended reliefs for mining operations; alterations to the tax treatment of scrip dividends and tax credits announced in the budget; technical changes to tax law to reflect the new US/Ireland double tax treaty; and some minor changes to assist particular investment vehicles in the IFSC and Shannon.</P>
    <P>It is worth mentioning, in relation to the US-Ireland double tax treaty, that section 14 of the Bill confirms that US social security pensions paid to Irish residents are now exempt from the US withholding tax of 25.5 per cent, to which they were subject up to 1 January 1998.  This exemption, which was a cause of annoyance to recipients of US pensions in Ireland, was conceded by the US authorities on the understanding that the pensions in question would be fully taxable here.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 of Part I, sections 43 to 48, deals with corporation tax measures exclusively.  Sections 43 and 44 give effect to the reduction in corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent and from 28 per cent to 25 per cent in respect of the first £50,000 of the company profits which was announced in the budget with effect from 1 January 1998.  Sections 47 and 48 set out the proposed new reliefs for company donations to charities and investment by companies in certain renewable energy projects respectively.  The latter relief must be cleared with the EU prior to its coming into effect.  There are a number of other reliefs <Col N="429" /> proposed in the Bill that require notification to or approval by the Commission.</P>
    <P>My officials have been in regular and recent contact with Commission officials and I am hopeful of a positive outcome all round.  In regard to the single rate of corporation tax, discussions are continuing with the Commission to secure their final sign off on the planned timetable for achieving that single low rate.</P>
    <P>Sections 49 to 59 in Chapter 5 deal with capital gains tax.  Some Opposition speakers have sought to make much of the cut in CGT from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, portraying it as a bonus to the rich. This is an unwarranted portrayal.  My reasons for this decision were clearly spelt out in my Budget Statement.  I have been strongly of the view for some time that a reduction in CGT will encourage investment and growth in the economy, promote capital formation and, over time, expand the revenue from CGT.</P>
    <P>In my experience, many taxpayers simply would not realise investments at a 40 per cent CGT rate and invest in new wealth generation.  I decided that, except for development land where windfall gains were involved, a cut across the board was the best way to proceed.  If I had wanted simply to give the better off a perk, I would not at the same time have radically cut the major tax shelters which I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>On specific capital gains tax issues, section 50 maintains the 40 per cent rate for investments in foreign life assurance policies and certain offshore roll-up funds to ensure broad equity of treatment as compared to the tax treatment of similar domestic investments.  Sections 51 and 52 address a tax problem in relation to a waiver of property under the State Property Act, 1954.</P>
    <P>The provisions ensure that any subsequent disposal of the property by the person acquiring it in this way will be fairly taxed.  Section 53 provides for relief, in certain circumstances, from the CGT liability which arises on a trustee of settled property where a life interest is disposed of. Section 55 affords capital gains tax roll-over relief in respect of the disposal of financial assets by certain sporting bodies and section 57 extends to greyhound racing tracks roll-over relief on the disposal of development land where the proceeds are reinvested in race track facilities.  A similar relief was given to racecourses in last year's Finance Act.  Section 59 provides that a capital gains tax exemption limit of £1,000 will apply per individual. This is an increase in the limit of £500 per annum proposed in the budget and is aimed at relieving the capital gains tax liability on smaller investors.</P>
    <P>Parts 2 and 3 relate to indirect taxation. Sections 60 to 64 deal with VRT and give effect to the reduction in rates of VRT on cars announced in the budget.  There are also provisions to tighten up the law on the registration of vehicles in a crashed condition, the refund of VRT on demonstration or replacement vehicles in the motor and car hire trade, and the forfeiture of vehicles which have been converted privately, <Col N="430" /> for example, from a car van, liable at 13.3 per cent, to a car as such, liable at 22.5 per cent, without payment of the additional VRT.</P>
    <P>Sections 65 to 84 deal with miscellaneous matters concerning excise duties.  The provisions here may be categorised as follows: confirmation of the increases in excise rates on tobacco and certain road fuels announced in the budget; changes in the licensing arrangements for betting shops and gaming and amusement premises to allow extended opening times; improvements in the enforcement arrangements for breaches of customs and excise law through new rules governing the commencement of customs proceedings, the production of samples of products in court prosecutions, and the confirmation of the powers of members of the Garda to arrest suspects in relation to certain excise offences; miscellaneous provisions to tidy up excise law to remove an archaic restriction on the granting of wine on-licences; to do away with certain oil duty rebates; to redefine cider and perry for purposes of excise duty; and to allow duty deferment on spirits in December in the same way as beer and wine; and, finally, a number of technical applications of EU directives on the control and movement of excisable products involving mutual assistance between member states, certain documentary procedures, territorial scope and treatment of losses.</P>
    <P>The changes I am making to the opening hours of betting shops is to acknowledge the reality of betting practice nowadays and the staging of sporting events in the evening and on Sundays.  It recognises reality.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of important changes in the area of VAT.  Much of what is in Part 3 on value-added tax is of a technical or sectoral nature dealing with VAT self supply rules, the charging of VAT on telephone cards and certain financial services, VAT on AI products and services, live poultry, and on air traffic control services.  The Bill also gives effect to the increase in the farmers' flat rate of VAT from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent together with a corresponding change in the related VAT rate on the supply of livestock, live greyhounds and the hire of horses. There is also the proposed reduction in the VAT rate on magazines from 21 per cent to 12.5 per cent with effect from 1 May 1998.  I have asked my Department to liaise with the Director of Consumer Affairs to help to ensure that the reduction is passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Sections 92 and 93 contain important new provisions on the assessment and refund of VAT.  In recent years there has been increased focus by tax planners both here and in other member states on exploiting the opportunities in EU VAT law for new interpretations of VAT provisions.  Given that the yield from VAT is considerable and that successful VAT planning schemes can be costly, it is important from the Exchequer's point of view to seek to limit the potential damage.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is also important to reduce the exposure of the Exchequer to claims for VAT <Col N="431" /> refunds.  Section 92 reduces the time limit within which a VAT refund may be claimed from ten to six years.  Accordingly, VAT refund claims in respect of VAT taxable periods arising from 1 May 1998 will be subject to the new six year time limit.  There will be transitional arrangements in relation to VAT taxable periods before 1 May 1998.  In such cases, the new six year time limits will apply as and from 1 May 1999.  For reasons of equity, section 93 also applies the reduced time limit to VAT assessments by the Revenue Commissioners. Furthermore, the new period will correspond with the existing requirement for traders to keep records for six years.  The advance notice of one year for possible pipeline claims is consistent with the approach taken in other areas when the use of a tax relief, such as BES tax relief, is being restricted.</P>
    <P>In addition, section 92 clarifies the rules designed to avoid windfall gains which may occur with VAT repayments, taking into account the outcome of cases in the European Court of Justice, in the courts in other member states and in domestic appeal commissioners' cases.</P>
    <P>I will explain in more detail how this can arise. Overpayments of VAT may occur where a mistaken assumption has been made as regards the operation of VAT by either a trader or by the Revenue Commissioners.  In these cases, a refund to a trader could result in a windfall gain.  This is because the VAT concerned would already have been paid by customers in the prices charged by the trader.  A refund to the trader in these circumstances is not warranted as the customers will not be compensated.  However, where a trader undertakes to repay overpaid VAT to the customers concerned, the Revenue Commissioners will make a refund provided they are satisfied the trader has arrangements in place to do so.</P>
    <P>In addition, there may be some cases where the VAT has been passed on but where a trader may still have lost business due to the mistake.  The section provides for a degree of compensation in such cases.  To avail of compensation, the claimant must establish that there was a loss of profits on reduced turnover as a result of the incorrect VAT treatment.</P>
    <P>Sections 96 to 102 contain a number of technical amendments to the stamp duty code and repeal a series of superfluous or redundant stamp duty provisions in various finance and other Acts dating back to 1830.  The impact overall is to extend stamp duty exemptions and to lighten the burden of administration on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The sections dealing with Capital Acquisitions Tax rectify certain shortcomings in the existing provisions dealing with business reliefs and appeals against CAT assessments.  More importantly, section 103 gives effect to the budget proposal to increase the relief for capital acquisitions tax purposes in respect of part or all of the family home inherited by an elderly person from a deceased brother or sister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="432" /> The section also introduces a new relief in similar cases where the home is inherited by a close relative of the deceased owner, for example, a niece, where both parties have been living in the house for at least ten years prior to the inheritance. The relief means that the value of the home for CAT purposes will be reduced by 80 per cent, or £150,000, whichever is the lesser.  The existing relief for brothers and sisters is 60 per cent, or £80,000, whichever was the lesser.  The new and revised reliefs will reduce considerably the amount of CAT to be paid by the inheritors in the situations I have described.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Bill contains what has proved its most contentious and misconstrued provision. Section 107 provides for the increase in the rate of DIRT on special savings accounts from 15 to 20 per cent announced in the budget and proposed to apply a 20 per cent rate of DIRT to deposits in credit unions.  The section also proposed to apply a requirement that credit unions report to Revenue all dividend income paid on shareholdings where this income exceeds £500 per annum.</P>
    <P>In the heat and excitement of recent days one simple and important point has been ignored or downplayed by those unhappy with this move. Under existing law all dividend and interest income on credit union shares and deposits has, for many years, been liable to tax at the recipient's marginal rate of tax and must, irrespective of the amount, be returned by the individual to Revenue whether or not reported by the credit union.  DIRT on deposit interest would have replaced this liability to tax at up to 46 per cent by a final liability of 20 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only were no new taxes being proposed but the Bill also continued the exemption of credit unions from corporation tax. The DIRT tax and reporting requirements on dividend income would have applied to a very small number of account holders in a credit union.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt that I have great regard for the role played by credit unions in every town, parish and place of employment in the State.  I have great admiration for the dedication, effort and integrity of the army of credit union workers both full time and voluntary.  I have no difficulty recognising all that is good with the credit union philosophy of mutuality, thrift, self-help and putting the interest of members above narrow commercial considerations.  Many other financial institutions have only in the past decade learned the value of putting the customer first and the importance of quality service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have to consider the credit union situation in the context of the overall tax treatment of citizens.  I made this clear to the movement when I met it yesterday.  The aim and tone of the meeting yesterday evening was to seek to work towards a common solution.  After a lengthy <Col N="433" /> discussion with the league, proposals were formulated which it has accepted.  As a result, it has been agreed to continue the corporation tax exemption for the surplus income of credit unions, to drop the proposal in the Finance Bill to apply DIRT to deposits, to drop the proposed requirement for the reporting of dividends of credit unions where these exceed £500 per annum, to remove the existing reporting requirement in relation to deposit interest over £500 per annum and to set up a working group with the Irish League of Credit Unions under an independent chairperson to examine the taxation of the return on credit union savings bearing in mind the special and particular nature of the credit union movement, its contribution to Irish society and the wider taxation issues involved.  The working group will report to me by 30 September 1998.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied these proposals offer a reasonable basis for addressing the issue of credit union taxation.</P>
    <P>It was always clear that the introduction of the expanded powers for credit unions under the Credit Union Act, 1997 would bring the taxation issues to the fore and that the new position of credit unions would have to be dealt with.  This is what the Government is seeking to do in the interest of fairness and equity for all taxpayers, including those with savings in credit unions.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill may be less exciting, but nonetheless they are important. Section 108 contains enabling provisions for the extension of tax clearance to solicitors and counsel who are on the criminal legal aid scheme panels.  Section 109, and section 101 in relation to stamp duty, reduces the rate of interest charged by Revenue on unpaid taxes or paid by Revenue on refunds of certain taxes.</P>
    <P>Section 110 permits the publication by appeal commissioners of their decisions in appeal cases decided by them.  This will assist taxpayers and practitioners in being clear about how tax law affects them.  The identity of taxpayers, however, may not be divulged in such publication.</P>
    <P>That concludes the substantive provisions of the Bill.  On Committee Stage I propose to introduce, in particular, a scheme of tax relief for cross-Border workers to deal with this issue which has been a source of contention for some time, a tax allowance for seafarers to assist the maritime transport sector, a new pilot scheme of relief for a defined rural area to encourage its renewal and development as well as a new urban renewal scheme.  There will be a number of other amendments, as is usual with every Finance Bill, to deal with tax items currently under consideration.</P>
    <P>The question of extra Revenue powers was debated very recently in the House.  I want to state clearly once again that I have no time for those who engage in tax evasion or those who assist or abet tax evaders.  I have also made it clear that Revenue have a wide range of powers to combat evasion.  They have powers to access bank accounts, although only in certain specified <Col N="434" /> circumstances where they have the names of the account holders.  The House will be aware that following the publication of the report of the McCracken tribunal, I asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to review the existing powers and to come back to me if they believed these should be augmented.  If additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, legislative proposals will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>If we want further powers for Revenue, the sensible and best approach would be for such decisions to be taken in the light of all relevant available information.  This would include information and recommendations which the Moriarty tribunal may provide.  It would also mean taking account of what the authorised officers appointed by the Tánaiste under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990 may discover in their examination of the companies concerned.  It would also include material or facts thrown up by more recent events.</P>
    <P>There are many views and contributions on what should be done in this area.  It is important that we listen to all relevant contributions and evidence before deciding.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has written to me expressing its position and making a number of suggestions and I will arrange for a meeting with Congress in the near future to explore its proposals.</P>
    <P>There are many important and positive features in this Bill and I look forward to a constructive debate.  I am pleased therefore to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials for putting a script before the House which explains the measures of the Finance Bill in fuller detail than the explanatory memorandum.  I am sure the Minister will be disappointed to hear Fine Gael is opposed to the Bill and will vote against it on Second Stage.  It is opposed to it for the same reasons it opposed the budget.  The Minister's new proposals regarding the credit unions and the opening hours of betting offices will also be opposed by Fine Gael, although I understand he has backed down on his proposals in relation to credit unions.</P>
      <P>Our position is well founded.  No Minister for Finance had the opportunity of this Minister on budget day.  The Exchequer was never in a more favourable position, there was never such growth in the economy or confidence in our people and there was a universal wish that the Government would successfully carry forward the excellent work done by the rainbow Government.  The feeling of goodwill to the Minister on the eve of the budget crossed party political lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget was a let-down and that let-down is now being enshrined in law.  If the House enacts the tax provisions that underline the budget, economic welfare and social progress in this society will be set back.  The Finance Bill is unfair because it proposes to enact an unfair budget. The Minister should think again.  Fine Gael <Col N="435" /> believes the Bill is unfair and unjust.  Its primary benefits are conferred on those on higher incomes and the very wealthy.  The poor and those on moderate and middle incomes benefit very little from the Minister's largesse.  Fine Gael believes that at this stage of economic and social development, the Minister should have targeted the poor and those on middle and low income in his income tax reliefs.  By adopting the PD policy of cutting rates rather than widening the standard bands and increasing personal allowances, disproportionate benefit has been conferred on high income earners at the expense of the less well off.</P>
    <P>In its programme for Government the Government is committed to reducing the percentage of taxpayers who pay tax at the higher rate.  The programme commits the Government to ensuring that not more than 20 per cent of taxpayers pay tax at the higher rate.  Despite this commitment the Minister was forced off this ground by the Progressive Democrats and confirmed in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy McGrath that the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at the higher rate will be increased under the Finance Bill.  According to the Minister's reply of Tuesday, 9 December 1997, in the tax year 1997-98, 37 per cent of taxpayers pay tax at the higher rate.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. This outcome is contrary to the theory which the Minister has frequently advocated and agreed. When the relevant parliamentary question was answered after the budget the Minister was as surprised by the information it contained as anybody else.  I have said frequently that I often note the Minister's surprise when turning the pages of a script and giving out information.  The Minister hopes to reach his target of 18 per cent on the standard rate and not more than 20 per cent on the higher rate by going in the opposite direction. I acknowledge that Christopher Columbus sailed west to get to India but the Minister is no Columbus and will not achieve his stated programme commitment by moving in the opposite direction in his first budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal problem with our income tax code is not that the higher rate is 48 per cent or 46 per cent, it is that taxpayers move on to the higher rate at very moderate levels of income.  This is especially true of single persons. It is the jump from 24 per cent to 46 per cent which will continue to seriously anger taxpayers. That is the issue.  People are being taxed on too low an income and should be exempt.  The Minister should have taken large numbers of taxpayers out of the net completely.  If the Minister follows the Progressive Democrats formula he will not be in Government for long and will not return.  This game was tried previously and it did <Col N="437" /> not work.  It is a nonsensical way to address the tax issue.  By giving the money to lower income earners, correcting the exemption levels and personal allowances and increasing the standard rate band everyone would gain proportionately because any concessions made in terms of allowances or standard rate bands extend to all the income bands and the benefits are not frittered away for those at the higher level of income.</P>
      <P>Any international comparison with our European neighbours or with developed economies will show that the low level at which the higher rate of tax applies is totally out of line with the practice in those comparable countries.  The solution to this problem is to widen the standard rate band and increase allowances.  If the Minister gives priority to cutting tax rates he will not have the resources to widen the bands and to cut personal allowances, so the unfair system will continue.</P>
      <P>If allowances were increased and the standard rate band widened, low paid persons would be taken out of the tax net and persons on moderate incomes would pay tax at the standard rate only. The Minister chose to go down a different road. This has resulted in a socially unjust Finance Bill, enacting a socially unjust budget.  Apart from the Finance Bill being unfair it is also bad economics. The Minister's attitude to income tax is bad economics for two reasons: it puts pressure on the social partnership and will do little or nothing to free up the labour market by eliminating welfare traps or allow those on moderate incomes to participate more fully in the workforce.  We all know &mdash; this was predictable on budget day &mdash; that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is unhappy with the income tax relief which discriminates against the majority of its members.  Social partnership has made a major contribution to our increasing prosperity.  It is reasonable to expect that those workers who accepted moderate pay increases on the promise that there would be significant reductions in income tax would actually benefit from such tax cuts.  The benefits are not up to expectations and this will cause industrial unrest unless the Minister mends his hand.  Partnership 2000 will not see the millennium if he continues on the same path of tax relief as in this budget.</P>
      <P>Labour shortages are an increasing feature of the Irish economy.  The media has highlighted on a number of occasions the shortages of highly qualified persons with skills in information technology. The shortage at the other end of the spectrum is even more acute.  Had he significantly raised exemption limits, increased personal allowances and widened the standard rate band the Minister could have remedied this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More persons on long-term unemployment would be attracted to return to the labour force. Married women would be encouraged to join the labour force and low paid workers, who refuse overtime as the extra earnings push them into the higher tax bands, would have been encouraged to work overtime to meet the periodic increases in demand which many manufacturers experience <Col N="438" /> and for which it would be premature to take on extra workers.  This is an increasing problem which is already inhibiting economic growth and should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The disappointment and hurt experienced by taxpayers at the unfairness of the income tax measures in the Finance Bill is magnified by the contrast which a cut in capital gains tax, from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, presents.  Even this measure which confers huge rewards for the wealthy has a sting in the tail which hits the small investor.  Capital gains allowances have been slashed.  It is a big man's budget even in respect of capital gains.</P>
    <P>I refer briefly to other measures in the Finance Bill.  Fine Gael supports the changes in corporation tax announced in the budget.  A new rate of 12.5 per cent for all business will be a major asset to the economy.  This rate was negotiated with the European Commission and announced by the previous Government.  This Administration acted with profound stupidity which has become one of its hallmarks when it reopened this issue at the beginning of its term of office.  I am pleased, despite self-created difficulties, the Tánaiste seems to have negotiated her way back to the position agreed by the European Commission last May with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister cast doubt on this today when he said contact between EU officials and his civil servants is continuing and that it is hoped a single rate of corporation tax can be agreed in the near future.  He hopes everybody will be in a position to sign off before long.  I understood from exchanges at Question Time in the House that had occurred prior to the budget, that the agreement was fully bedded down and that the Administration had signed off.  I prepared my remarks on that basis and I note from the Minister that it is not yet bedded down and has not been agreed.  The scheduling of the lower rate has not yet been agreed and signed off.  I am surprised at that and I hope the Minister will deal with it in reply.  My curiosity is aroused by the phraseology used which refers to the final sign off of a planned timetable for achieving a single lower rate.  My understanding was that we had national discretion only in terms of a standard rate and no discretion on variables on that rate.  I am surprised it is not described as a single standard rate rather than a single lower rate.  A single lower rate suggests a variation from a standard rate. Was the Minister frank with us the day before the budget?  When questioned on this issue he gave the clear impression that everything was fine.</P>
    <P>The Minister should share his thoughts with Members on this issue which arises from the comparatively low level of corporation tax, which we hope will continue to prevail when it moves from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.  The Minister and Members are aware that other members of the Community, particularly Germany, are extremely critical of our lower rates, particularly in so far as they apply to financial services.  The Germans <Col N="439" /> believe these rates lead to a serious loss of revenue to the German Exchequer.  Other European countries are critical of our low rates because they are perceived as unfair competition, attracting away mobile investment &mdash; a debate with which the Minister will be familiar.  I am sure this has been said to him directly in bilaterals with his colleagues in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be more forthcoming on this issue.  The 12.5 per cent rate is not contained in the Finance Bill but movements in that direction are indicated in it.  We need to hear more about this from the Minister because the issue is being clouded.  All Members are aware that as soon as the EMU agenda is bedded down the next item on the EU agenda is the harmonisation of taxes.  We would be well advised to have fully signed off and bedded down a standard business rate of 12.5 per cent before the serious debate on the harmonisation of taxes opens in Europe.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left negotiated the 12.5 per cent rate in their last months in Government.  A battle has been won but the war on this issue is only beginning in Europe.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has abandoned his ill thought out proposals in respect of credit unions. They were fully in line with the thinking and philosophy which underpins this Bill &mdash; if one has a small stake in the country, the Government will hammer one but if one has a big stake, one will be extravagantly rewarded.  Therefore, when the Minister introduced measures in respect of credit unions which were not announced in the budget this did not surprise us.  He is also removing the requirement to report deposits in excess of £500. This amounts to brilliant negotiation on which he should be congratulated.  When he introduced measures to tax credit unions they hammered him.  In negotiations, rather than impose penalties, he grants them a concession.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Rabbitte said, the position will be serious if, in fixing the rate at which the currency will lock in, the Minister negotiates with our colleagues on the same basis. I understand he has established a working party which will report to him on 30 September.  This is a fig leaf to hide his blushes.  It would not be appropriate for anyone to attempt to pull it away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to drop another badly thought out proposal, that is, the proposal to extend the opening hours of bookies' offices. There has been no consultation with bookmakers or their employees who are particularly irate that they are to be asked to work longer and more unsocial hours during the summer.  Everybody else will get a break but these in bookies' offices will work up to 10 p.m. Everybody else will be able to spend Sunday with their family but employees in bookies' offices will be required to <Col N="440" /> be inside when races are shown on television and the people whom the Minister believes should be facilitated will continue to place their bets.</P>
    <P>This is a bad proposal for which no case has been made.  There is no demand for it from the trade or public.  Punting is great fun on and off the course and is enjoyed by thousands of men and women.  Addictive gambling, however, is a disease and leads to massive social problems.  The country does not need extended opening hours at bookies' offices.  We will oppose this proposal.  It has the appearance of something that was dreamed up by the Minister and his buddies on their way home from the races.</P>
    <P>This Bill enacts expansionary budget provisions. Our entry to EMU will reduce interest rates by almost 2 per cent.  There is already massive consumer demand in the economy.  Against this background a prudent Minister would be wary of inflation and would have moved in the Finance Bill to take measures to meet the threat. There is asset inflation which has hit the housing sector in particular.  The young teacher, nurse, garda, civil servant, the worker who earns in excess of the average industrial wage in private industry and the middle sections of the public service can no longer afford to buy their own home, particularly if they are resident in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The prospective reduction of 2 per cent in interest rates will add to the demand.  The reduction, from 40 per cent to 20 per cent, in capital gains tax has already inflated prices.  I have been informed &mdash; I am sure the Minister will correct me if I have been misinformed &mdash; that 40 per cent of houses sold in the Dublin area since the start of the year have been bought for investment purposes.  This is driving prices beyond what young people can afford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and is distorting the housing market.  The Minister has to bear responsibility because the reduction in capital gains tax impacted immediately from the first week of January.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I will table an amendment under which first time buyers of second hand houses up to a value of £100,000 would be exempt from stamp duty.  This would provide relief of £6,000.  Fine Gael believes this would free the housing market and ensure a much better use of the national housing stock and a much better age mix in existing housing estates.  This is economically and socially desirable.  It would be much better for society if young couples raised their families where schools, shops, medical, social and other facilities exist and where parents or older neighbours could provide support rather than being forced out to the edges of towns and cities, principally because of the exemption from stamp duty which applies to new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a positive suggestion and the Minister should examine it seriously.  We will not accuse him of anything if he decides to accept it.  It would impact immediately from 6 April, knock some <Col N="441" /> steam out of the new house market and restore some sense to it.</P>
    <P>I will table an amendment to increase from 15 per cent the percentage of income taxpayers may invest free in superannuation schemes.  Providing for social welfare and public service pensions could be a nightmare for a future Administration. No funding provision is made for social welfare or public service pensions.  The tight fiscal constraints which will follow EMU entry will put the provisions for many public service pensions under severe stress if the economy suffers from the major asymmetric shocks that people talk about.</P>
    <P>The Government should actively encourage workers to make provision for their pensions in funded schemes.  A provision of 15 per cent of gross income per year is not sufficient for a person at 30 years of age who wants to retire at 60 or 65.  This threshold should be raised.  I ask the Minister and his officials to consider the possibility of a trade-off in terms of reductions in the pension element of PRSI payments for persons who fully fund their pensions.</P>
    <P>I fear for the future funding of pensions.  Anybody who looks at the demographics should share this view.  Given the stability pact attendant on EMU and the constraints on the Minister in normal circumstances to balance the budget or run surpluses, there will be shaky periods in the future.  We should start to make provision now to a greater extent for persons who fund their pensions.</P>
    <P>I fear what inflation may do to the economy. Against the background created by the Government of an expansionary budget, it is difficult to propose anything in the Finance Bill that would dampen consumer demand.  My proposal, however, on pensions would help as people would be encouraged to invest a higher proportion of their earnings in pension schemes.  A significant take-up would reduce consumer demand and act as a break on inflation.  In present circumstances where consumer demand is increasing rapidly any scheme that encourages people to invest rather than spend to make provision for their future and that of their families is a good one and will have a macroeconomic effect.</P>
    <P>I will table amendments in respect of the black economy and tax evasion.  We have a thriving economy and the majority of people who are reaping the benefits are paying their way.  Others who are reaping significant benefits are not paying their way.  Those whose philosophy of life is to take all and not give anything back must be stopped.  We must root out the tax evaders and the warriors of the black economy.  The shoulders of compliant taxpayers are too weary to carry them any longer.</P>
    <P>In respect of tax evasion, while the Minister introduced some measures that target avoidance which has been brought to his attention by the Revenue Commissioners, I am disappointed he has not addressed the wider issue.  The Minister made some general commitments at the end of his contribution.  He said he has asked officials of <Col N="442" /> his Department and the Revenue Commissioners to advise him as to the new powers that may be desirable as a result of the revelations in the McCracken report and recent events &mdash; I presume the Minister is thinking of the events surrounding National Irish Bank &mdash; but he is very vague about what he wants to do.  He said he has asked them to make recommendations to him but he did not tell us whether they have done so.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said he has had correspondence from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions about this matter.  While he expressed a willingness to meet the ICTU to the degree that he is agreeing a meeting, he did not indicate that the advice from his officials, the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or Members of this House will be taken into account in the context of this Finance Bill.  Is the Minister talking about legislation at some unmentioned time in the future?  Is he talking about the 1999 Finance Bill or is he prepared to take measures on evasion and on the black economy in the context of this Finance Bill?  It seems that he is not because he indicated that he will be bringing forward a series of far reaching amendments yet he failed to mention any in terms of tax evasion.  The Minister was less than frank on this issue.  He gave the impression of activity where I believe there is no activity intended.  The Minister should address this matter further in his reply to Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I will table further amendments also which will address problems in agriculture, rural development and other areas of the economy.  The Minister signalled his intention to table amendments in respect of cross-Border workers, an issue which he said has been a source of contention for a long time.  He also said he intended to table amendments in respect of tax allowance for seafarers to assist the maritime transport sector, and he will introduce a new pilot scheme of relief for a defined rural area to encourage its renewal and development as well as a new urban renewal scheme.</P>
    <P>It is extremely unfair that amendments of such magnitude should be signalled in the Minister's contribution and are not contained in the Finance Bill.  The Minister announced some of these schemes on budget day.  Why are they not in the text of the Bill?  When will they be brought in?  I want to put it bluntly to the Minister that if he brings in a series of wide-ranging amendments which amount to another small Finance Bill on the morning we go into committee, I will not deal with them.  The Minister will be on his own. Unless we get the amendments in advance I will not deal with them.  I will not put up with a situation where I will be given reams of paper I cannot analyse or be in a position to get advice on and to which I want to table amendments.  If I get the amendments too late to do that, there will not be a Committee Stage debate as far as my party is concerned.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy in this House to whom I have spoken is interested either in the new urban <Col N="443" /> renewal scheme or, more particularly, the pilot project of rural renewal.  The issue of the decline in rural Ireland is important to all parties in this House and I am looking for a commitment from the Minister, in his reply to Second Stage, that he will give us these amendments in sufficient time so that we can analyse, get advice on and table amendments to them as we see fit.  They are, in effect, an integral part of a Finance Bill.  They should be in the text of the Finance Bill.  They are not technical amendments or amendments that arise from the debate.  They are Finance Bill measures which the Minister intended to introduce since budget day and there is no excuse for their not being before us now.</P>
    <P>It makes me smile when the Minister talks about the Julian and the Gregorian calendar and his intention to align the tax year with the calendar year.  If the Minister's Department and the Revenue Commissioners cannot meet the deadline for the publication of the Finance Bill for a budget that went through the House the first week in December, what hope is there that he will make the major change in aligning the tax year with the calendar year?  It is not acceptable that large chunks of the Finance Bill which the Minister fully intends to introduce should be left until Committee Stage.  They should be in the text of the Bill and it is not fair to this House.</P>
    <P>I say this advisedly to the Minister.  A serious problem will arise if these amendments are brought in at a point where they cannot be examined by me, my colleague, Deputy Deenihan, and those who advise us, and if we are not given the same opportunity to table amendments as was given in respect of the sections of the Finance Bill published today.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated that there will be a number of other amendments, as is usual in every Finance Bill, to deal with tax items currently under consideration.  I do not have any problem with that.  That is normal procedure, but we want to see in time the amendments already signalled, which are the concern of every Deputy in this House, and particularly those on the pilot project for rural development and the new urban renewal scheme.  We will not allow the Minister to waltz them through the House to the advantage of a particular set of locations in the country and to the disadvantage of all the others.</P>
    <P>In terms of the Minister's reform of the BES schemes, I understand a problem is emerging with hotels in particular that are in the process of raising capital.  They believe that even the amended dates the Minister announced today are not sufficient to allow them invest the capital.  There is a problem in BES schemes in respect of wind farms because the planning procedures is unduly lengthy. If we are serious about alternative energy I ask the Minister to request his officials to examine a different regime for any BES scheme that is to fund wind farms to generate electricity.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to change the filing date for returns on self-assessment and align it with <Col N="444" /> the day for the payment of preliminary tax.  This is a contentious issue in the profession and the Minister should reconsider it.  I welcome the fact that these sections will only be brought in by way of commencement order, and I will not set down a marker that we will oppose it, but I ask the Minister to have full consultation with the professional bodies.  A commencement order is a good device and I welcome the Minister's change of mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for a very full explanation of the measures he has laid before us and I look forward to Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I make the substantive part of my contribution I want to endorse entirely what Deputy Noonan said about the timing of some of the amendments, particularly in relation to the renewal schemes.  Frankly, in current circumstances the detailed provisions of some of these schemes are too generous and are not needed.  I want to have an opportunity to examine the proposed new scheme over the course of the coming weekend, if that is possible.  It will cause some difficulty for the Opposition parties if we are not given the opportunity to do that.</P>
      <P>The events of the past few months have come as a considerable shock to a great number of people.  They have demonstrated who wields power in Ireland and on whose behalf power is wielded by the Government.  It is probably fair to say that for many years the left in this country and elsewhere in Europe used a rhetoric and a language which now seems outdated.  We regularly cited statistics which indicated that a small percentage of people owned a huge percentage of wealth.  We advocated solutions which were always idealistic but sometimes less than practical.  Over the years our language has changed.  We now use the language of social partnership rather than that of class envy.  We look to advocate solutions which are capable of implementation on the Government benches rather than solutions that made us feel good in Opposition.  Our language and message have changed, but the events of recent months have demonstrated more clearly than at any time in the recent past that perhaps our analysis was not all that wide of the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The past few months have given us a rare and important glimpse of how some rich and very rich people live.  They showed us how millions of pounds can be stashed away in so called offshore accounts in a bank in Stephen's Green.  We have seen how one of the big four banks appears to have actively promoted a product which appears to have been designed to help people evade paying tax.  We have seen a report from the Revenue Commissioners which confirms that a huge number of rich and very rich people pay little or no tax.  We have seen how some political parties, and one of the most prominent figures in Irish politics in the past 20 years, have been secretly bank-rolled by big business in a way which, to say the least, was unhealthy.  More importantly and most <Col N="445" /> strikingly, we have seen a Government and Minister for Finance whose actions are intended explicitly or implicitly to disproportionately benefit the rich and the very rich, often at the expense of the rest of us.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister decided to take on the credit unions and their members.  It was an act of political stupidity and it surprises nobody that the Minister has now reversed his decision.  One might be tempted to think the matter is now over, but that would be to miss the point.  What is important about this episode is not the substance of what the Minister tried to do, but what it tells us about the Minister's priorities, judgment and instincts and those of the Government.</P>
    <P>It is possible the Minister did this under pressure from the big banks.  They are never slow to trumpet their importance in our economy.  They have always been good supporters of Fianna Fáil. They got a decent kickback in the budget when the higher rate of corporation tax was reduced. Perhaps they wanted more.  Perhaps they wanted to ensure that potential competition from the credit unions was snuffed out at an early stage.  Perhaps it was the view of the commercial banks that swayed the Minister, but on balance my guess is it was something more than that.  I suspect the Minister genuinely believes that this is an anti-avoidance measure.  He probably believes it would level the playing pitch between different investors.</P>
    <P>In view of what the Minister said, I want to be fair and call a spade a spade.  The truth of the matter is that many credit union shareholders do not declare their dividend for income tax purposes. Inasmuch as those people have other taxable income, failure to declare is tax evasion and is illegal.  We cannot condone that and we need to do something about it, but that is where my view diverges completely from that of the Minister. We should explicitly recognise credit unions as small community based organisations where ordinary people become shareholders by investing a relatively small amount of money.  It is not fair or reasonable to treat them in the same way as people who play the stock market.  We should seek to support small savers and the credit union movement.  Credit unions are probably the only genuine mutual societies here with a solid public base and they deserve public support.  I have no hesitation in saying we should exempt from income tax dividend income from credit union shares up to a certain reasonable threshold. Tax should be charged on money held by way of shares above that threshold at the same rate as the deposit interest retention tax charged by the commercial banks.  We should seek to regularise the current position to support small savers. Instead of doing that the Minister chose, in a very hamfisted way, to oblige credit unions to communicate with the Revenue in relation to some of their shareholders and, perhaps more importantly, to put the frighteners on everybody else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="446" /> What is most striking about the Minister's action is the contrast with his spectacular inaction when confronted with other matters concerning richer people.  The Minister has no difficulty whatever in pursuing hundreds of thousands of small savers so as to benefit the Exchequer by a mere £2 million per year.  It worth putting that figure into context.  The Department of Finance in 1997 underestimated its total likely tax take by in excess of £1 billion, 500 times the likely total tax take from the changes the Minister announced last week and abandoned this week. Yet this is the same Minister who refused to have the Ansbacher accounts investigated and who reacted with spectacular nonchalance when confronted with evidence that National Irish Bank was wittingly or unwittingly facilitating tax evasion. I remember well the Minister's reaction a few weeks ago.  He was at great pains to explain the total amount involved represented only a tiny part of NIB's total deposit income.  What he said and the way he said it reminded me of Margaret Thatcher when she came out of a meeting of British Commonwealth heads of state in Vancouver after she had been persuaded she should support &ldquo;teentsy weentsy sanctions&rdquo; against South Africa. She glared with contempt at the assembled media and said these are &ldquo;teentsy weentsy sanctions&rdquo;. The message was clear.  She was not in favour of them, and she did not want to support them and only did so because she thought they would not be effective.</P>
    <P>The Minister's interview a few weeks ago was in the same tone.  He was talking about only &ldquo;teentsy weentsy tax evasion&rdquo; and clearly he has not lost much sleep about it.  The message is clear enough.  The Minister will not go after the better off probably because he believes that could lead to a flight of capital.  It might also be politically embarrassing if some of those people prove to be financial backers of the parties in power. However, little people have no such power.  They cannot threaten a flight of capital.  If one were to go after the little savers, the ones who are evading a few pounds or at most a few hundred pounds of income tax, the chances are one would probably catch them.  That may force some old people to go back to stashing cash under their beds but the vast majority would pay up.  They do not have the power to resist.  However, the Minister forgot one critical fact.  The small savers may lack financial and economic power and direct access to the corridors of power, but they make up for that in numbers.  Ultimately, the small savers could make the Minister and his party suffer, not by withholding their money but by withholding their votes.  It is for that and no other reason this decision was reversed.</P>
    <P>The credit union provisions are only some of the provisions of the Finance Bill which show Minister McCreevy to be the class warrior he claims not to be.  He has long sought to portray himself as an ordinary Joe Soap who tells it like it is, but the events of the last few days demonstrate very clearly that the game is up.  The penny <Col N="447" /> is beginning to drop with people.  Slowly but surely they are beginning to realise that Charlie McCreevy's social welfare cuts was not just an aberration.  This Minister consistently uses his power to benefit those who are better off.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most clear-cut example is the reduction in the rate of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  I and others have persistently sought to find out why and at whose behest that decision was taken.  In the few months since the Budget Statement I have spoken to commentators and interested people about the contents of the budget.  I have yet to meet somebody who knew about the proposal to reduce that tax, who expected it or knows where it came from.  The Minister needs to give some straight answers to straight questions.  Who looked for, lobbied or asked for that change?  He should give us a list of the groups of people who made submissions looking for a change of that kind.  Better still he should let us have copies of those submissions.  It is a matter of public record that representatives of the Dunnes trust met officials of the Department some years ago and argued for changes in capital taxation.  Did the Minister or any of his officials meet with or receive submissions from representatives of the Dunnes trust?  Did the Minister or any of his officials receive representations from any of the other super rich people who stand to gain a great deal from the decision he announced on 3 December?  We know some super rich have already made huge savings as a result of the Minister's decision.  We have to assume he knew that would happen because everybody else did.  We also have to assume he was and is happy that should happen and, inevitably, we must ask why.</P>
    <P>I did not want to impute to the Minister motives which he may not have had, but I am at a complete loss to find any logical or decent economic argument for the change he made.  We are not helped by the fact that he has not given any credible reason for that tax reduction.  He has so far consigned himself to saying, and he repeated again here today, that he has always felt too many assets were being tied up because people were reluctant to dispose of them at the 40 per cent rate of tax.  Unfortunately for the Minister there is no evidence to support that view.  He has consistently failed to stand up that argument and he has been very slow to discuss the matter in public.  A single person earning £15,000 a year by the sweat of his brow will pay 48 per cent marginal tax.  Yet, someone who buys a house at the start of the year and sells it at the end of the year will pay just 20 per cent on the unearned income which results from his original investment.  How can this or any Minister for Finance possibly justify this on grounds of equity? Perhaps I am being naive in assuming that equity means a great deal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The most dramatic and immediate effect of the capital gains tax change has been its effect on the housing market.  Between 30 and 40 per cent of new houses built in urban areas, and certainly in <Col N="448" /> Dublin, are being sold for investment purposes. As a result, many young couples, not to mention single people, are being forced out of the housing market altogether.  Those who can find affordable houses often have to travel long distances in order to do so.  Young people who cannot find an affordable house in Dublin are being forced to go as far away as Drogheda, Tullamore or Mullingar with obvious knock on consequences for the housing market in those towns.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the problems of the housing market are a direct or total result of the change in capital gains tax because, obviously, this is not so.  However, the change in capital gains tax has increased the incentive to investors to invest their money in property and this, in turn, can only have the effect of pricing ordinary aspiring owner occupiers out of the market.</P>
    <P>I assume there is little chance of persuading the Minister to reverse his decision on capital gains tax generally.  However, there is surely a persuasive case for excluding private domestic dwelling houses from the windfall tax reduction.  Surely the Minister will agree that the last thing we need to do now is stimulate the housing market.  It is already suffering from a lack of building land. There are emerging shortages of labour in some critical crafts.  More and more people, including returned immigrants, are looking for houses.  In these circumstances, the last thing we should do is make private houses an even more attractive possibility for speculative investment.</P>
    <P>For many years the State's intervention in the housing market has largely been in order to support the construction industry and the significant employment it provides.  Quite clearly, for the moment &mdash; and it may not always be the case &mdash; that support is no longer necessary.  The industry is working at full capacity and there are even shortages of labour.  The thrust of State intervention and support must now shift significantly away from supporting the industry towards supporting the purchaser and, in particular, the first time purchaser.</P>
    <P>We can do this in a number of ways.  We can do it, as Deputy Noonan suggested, by eliminating the burden of stamp duty for first time purchasers of second hand houses.  However, we need to go further than this.  We have to provide a relative advantage to people who want to buy houses to live in them, in particular, people buying their first house, over and above people who want to buy a house in order to make money. Accordingly, we should re-institute stamp duty on new houses for everyone other than first time buyers.</P>
    <P>My wife and I are living in our first house.  If we wanted to move &mdash; and, incidentally, we do not intend to &mdash; there is no good or persuasive reason we should have to pay stamp duty at 6 per cent if we choose to buy a second hand house, but no stamp duty at all if we choose to buy a new house.  There are plenty of people in our position. More importantly, the imposition of stamp duty on new houses for people other than first time <Col N="449" /> purchasers would reduce the attractiveness of housing as a safe way of making a few shillings.</P>
    <P>This is a serious and genuine problem which we need to address as a matter of urgency.  I have proposed increases in tax which, coming from the Opposition benches, is a little unusual.  We need to do that in order to shift the emphasis of our support for the construction industry away from that industry, which is happening anyway, towards supporting the purchaser.  The Minister should look at that between now and next week.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at the effectiveness of urban renewal designations in making affordable housing available to first time purchasers.  I want to return to the area of special designation later in the context of capital allowances and I will have some comments to make in that regard.</P>
    <P>In fairness, capital gains tax is a tax which most people will never pay and do not understand how it works.  The one tax we do understand is income tax.  Once again the Minister has skewed his decisions in a way which disproportionately benefits the better off.  We had much of this debate on budget day and we have teased out a great deal of it since.  The argument is as valid now as it was three months ago.</P>
    <P>Suffice to say that had the Minister channelled all the additional moneys into broadening the bands and increasing the allowances, up to 90 per cent of people would be better off than they will be on 7 April next.  The Minister's decision will channel a huge amount of extra cash into the pockets of those who need it least.  As a result, he has failed or refused to tackle the poverty and unemployment traps which still exist within our taxation system.  He has put the social partnership process at risk and he has used the public's money in a way that is fundamentally unfair. Even worse, the Government is threatening us with more of the same medicine next year.</P>
    <P>The Government will say it has a mandate for all this &mdash; that it went before the people with a particular election manifesto which they voted to support.  Up to a point the Government is right. It is true it started the election campaign by advocating cuts in the rates of tax and only later, and rather hurriedly, added in some commitments in relation to bands and allowances.</P>
    <P>It is interesting and instructive, however, to look back to the budget debate this time last year and the arguments the then Opposition parties made for reducing the higher rate of tax.  I remember the then Deputy Michael McDowell making a case on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  Typically, he would give the example of a young person earning £15,000 or £16,000 and paying income tax at a marginal rate of 48 per cent.  These are people earning just slightly more than the maximum amount charged at the standard rate.  In a sense, it is no harm to focus on them quite simply because there are plenty of them.</P>
    <P>These people, perhaps more than any others, have a right to feel betrayed by what this Government has done.  Far from providing a bonanza, <Col N="450" /> which many of us may have expected, and far from taking them out of the upper rate of tax, all the budget has done is to reduce their marginal rate from 48 per cent to 46 per cent.</P>
    <P>The alternative would have been to reduce their marginal rate from 48 per cent to 26 per cent or 24 per cent.  We have said it often enough from these benches in the past, but obviously we must keep on saying it; there is nothing wrong with a relatively high rate of marginal taxation provided the right people are paying it.  People on £14,000, £15,000, £16,000 and £17,000 a year should not be paying tax at the high marginal rate.  Our taxation policy should be geared towards ensuring these people are taken out of the higher rate band.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a difference in the approach we adopted, which was fundamentally fair.  It may not have been spectacularly obvious or attractive, and perhaps that was ultimately to our disadvantage, but it was fair.  It would still be fair if we were doing it today.</P>
      <P>Reducing the higher rate of tax is of benefit only to those who pay the higher rate on a significant percentage of their income.  These are the people who have most cause to be grateful to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and his Government.</P>
      <P>Before Christmas, the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> produced extracts from a report drawn up by the Revenue Commissioners on the effective rate of tax paid by high earners &mdash; specifically, people on more than £250,000 a year.  Apparently, the Revenue Commissioners surveyed a number of people earning in excess of a quarter of a million pounds per year.  They found that one in five high earners pays an effective tax rate of approximately 20 per cent and nearly one in ten pays an effective tax rate of 5 per cent.  Only 8 per cent of taxpayers in the £250,000 plus income level pay an effective tax rate of between 45 and 48 per cent.</P>
      <P>These figures are a national scandal and must be addressed as a matter of priority by the Government.  In addressing this problem it would help if, in the first place, we could see the Revenue Commissioners' report.  Unfortunately, the Minister has decided to suppress the report and has given no reason for doing so.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to use his good offices to ask the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to publish the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> I do not know if it is possible to identify the affairs of individual taxpayers from the report &mdash; I doubt it &mdash; but if it is, surely it must be possible to excise those details from the report.  Information of this kind is vital to any public discussion on issues of taxation.  The public is entitled to this information and I ask the Minister to reconsider his earlier decision not to publish it.</P>
    <P>In so far as we can believe the press reports, and I have no reason to doubt them &mdash; the report suggests that high earners reduce their tax liability largely through using tax shelters such as capital allowances.  If that is so, we must look carefully at how capital allowances work.  In that regard, I support the Minister's decision to reduce the available capital allowances to £25,000.  I will support it next week in the event of a vote on the matter.</P>
    <P>We also need to look carefully at special designation schemes, such as those proposed for urban renewal, seaside resorts, etc.  The purpose of these schemes was and is to stimulate investment in areas where it would not otherwise occur.  We need to look urgently at the issues of displacement and dead weight.  There is no sense in these schemes if their primary effect is to transfer investment from one part of a town to another or if they merely stimulate investment which would have happened anyway.  There is certainly no sense in them if their primary benefit is to reduce the tax liability of people who can well afford to make a fair contribution to our society.</P>
    <P>I am not saying all urban renewal schemes are bad.  There are areas in cities and towns which would not have been developed but for urban renewal schemes.  In the context of what is happening in the housing market and the construction industry and the tax report by the Revenue Commissioners, we need to look at this matter on a case by case basis to assess if they are really needed and if they are achieving the aims they were intended to achieve.  I do not propose that we eliminate urban renewal schemes but we need to look again at the criteria and the way they are applied.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party supports the aim of introducing a single low rate of corporation tax of 12.5 per cent.  I assume from the Minister's silence on this issue in recent months that he also accepts that if a single rate is introduced, it will not be 10 per cent but 12.5 per cent.  There are two ways to achieve this.  We can either seek to increase the threshold for the lower rate of tax or reduce one or both rates of tax simultaneously.  The Minister has taken the wrong road.  More than 90 per cent of companies pay corporation tax at the lower rate.  They should get the primary and immediate benefit during the ten year period when we make the changeover.  We should try to increase the threshold and reduce the lower amount rather than giving the benefit to the 7 per cent of companies which pay tax at the higher rate.  I am talking about banks and companies which are active in the financial services sector.  They are our most <Col N="452" /> successful and they do not need a tax break.  We should concentrate our efforts on the small companies which have been the backbone of economic growth in recent years.  I am disappointed the Minister has chosen to go about it in this way.</P>
    <P>This is a period of almost unprecedented growth in the economy and prosperity in the country.  For the first time the Government has a real choice as to how it uses additional moneys and resources.  The challenge is to use those resources and to make the choices which will make Ireland a more inclusive, safer and fairer place in which to live.  By those standards, this Government is already failing miserably and the Finance Bill is just another step along that way.</P>

      <P>Many people might find it strange that following the publication of the Finance Bill the media and the Opposition decided to highlight the changes the Minister proposed for the credit unions.  It should not come as a great surprise to those on this side of the House that instead of outlining the true position, they tried to paint an unreal picture.  Anyone who looks at what was proposed will realise the Minister was harshly treated.  He enjoys a better relationship with the press than most Members of the House, yet he was savagely assaulted in recent days.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to outline what the credit unions proposed.  In a letter to the Minister following a meeting before Christmas, Mr. Tony Smyth, the general secretary of the Irish League of Credit Unions, said:</P>
      <P>We, in the course of the meeting, identified three issues:</P>
      <P>Corporation Tax on Credit Unions:</P>
      <P>We strongly suggest that the current exemption should remain.</P>
      <P>Interest on Deposits:</P>
      <P>We recognise the need for change in this area and suggest the application of DIRT at 15 per cent on all interest earned.</P>
      <P>Dividends on Shares:</P>
      <P>The biggest difficulty I had with the proposal was in relation to disclosure.  However, the matter was hyped up out of all proportion.  After reading the newspapers over the weekend, members of credit unions were led to believe they would have to face the Revenue Commissioners on Monday morning.  I call on the media to be more responsible when reporting events and to concentrate on the facts.  Hyperbole is all right in poetry but we should report the facts when dealing with serious issues such as the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>When someone in Government makes a proposal, the Opposition picks holes in it rather than highlighting its positive aspects. There are many positive aspects of the Finance Bill, although I am unhappy with some parts of it.  Deputy McDowell and his former colleagues in Democratic Left are envious of some of the proposals in this year's budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister explained the steps he will take following the hullabaloo over his proposals for the credit unions.  Following his meeting yesterday with the Irish League of Credit Unions, a working group has been set up which will report to the Minister by 30 September 1998.  Anyone who had fears about the reports in the newspapers over the weekend can rest easy that there will be no major changes for some time.</P>
      <P>The Opposition tried to suggest that the proposals in the Finance Bill to reduce capital gains tax will make the rich richer and the poor poorer. However, nothing could be further from the truth.  Fianna Fáil's record in Government shows that it does not neglect social welfare recipients. We have always tried to ensure that increases were in line with if not above inflation.  The Minister has introduced a number of worthwhile proposals to help the less well off in society.</P>
      <P>He explained on budget day and again today why he reduced capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  Anyone who has been in the House for a few years knows that this economic boom will not continue.  These changes are not for this year or next year but are part of a long-term strategy.  The Minister's decision to reduce capital gains tax was a courageous and correct one.  It is easy for people on the left to make him a scapegoat and accuse him of all types of things. When we look back at the decisions made, we will see how they benefited everyone.</P>
      <P>Capital gains tax of 40 per cent was excessive. Anyone involved in that area would not want to make too many mistakes or they would be out of business.  The reduction will encourage people to buy and sell shares more often as well as encouraging growth and investment in the economy.  U-turns are often unpopular and people do not usually advise the Minister to make them, but I am delighted he has rectified matters since his announcement in the budget of a reduction of the capital gains tax exemption limit to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years, the number of people holding shares has increased, and in many cases, especially for those lucky enough to have shares in the Irish Permanent, they have become very valuable within a short space of time.  While people did not set out to make a killing, they have found themselves with a nice little nest egg, and the reduction in capital gains tax from 40 to 20 per cent allows them sell their shares and enjoy the profits they make.  That is welcome and it answers the nonsense that changes were made in the budget for the rich and that the poor were <Col N="454" /> forgotten.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>Section 67 amends section 21 of the Betting Act, 1931, to allow for extended opening hours for betting shops.  In future, bookmakers' premises may remain open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. from April to August, inclusive, and from 7 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. from September to March, inclusive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the current restrictions on opening on Christmas Day, Good Friday and Easter Sunday will continue.  The Minister's reason for this is that there has been a significant growth in illegal betting with the advent of the racing channel and football matches being played three to four nights a week.  Tremendous opportunities exist for punters, so the Minister deemed it necessary to introduce these changes to allow punters who wish to do so to bet in the evening on these events.  I accept the Minister's proposal because illegal betting exists and there is no reason betting shops should not be allowed open in the evening.  There has been a tendency in the past few years, especially in Britain, for most good racing to take place at night, as it usually generates more betting than the mundane racing in the afternoon to which we have become accustomed.</P>
      <P>My worry about these changes concerns staff. The first evening meeting to take place in Britain will be on Friday, 24 April.  From my experience of the industry, many people working in it are young married women, some of them with children. This change in their terms of employment is severe.  At present, most of them finish before 6 p.m. unless it is a very busy day.  However, the office must close at 6 p.m., so they would almost certainly be out of the office by 6.30 p.m. What is proposed to come into effect within a matter of weeks would mean the office remaining open and working until 10 p.m. I see major difficulties for bookmakers and their staff in coming to terms with this.  Any permanent, full-time staff would work five days a week, including Saturdays, with a day off during the week.  That has not caused problems, but the opening hours the Minister proposes will make employment difficult for most people as regards babysitting arrangements.  I appeal to the Minister to put this proposal on hold.  While the idea is good, he should not consider implementing it until next year to allow those in the betting industry time to agree a system accommodating these new arrangements under which they could work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have become accustomed to Sunday racing in Ireland and it has become very popular.  Britain has now decided to follow suit, and the number of Sunday meetings is increasing.  Nonetheless, while it might make sense on paper, I do not believe the opening of betting offices on Sunday will prove to be the great attraction people think. Many families still regard Sunday as the family <Col N="455" /> day and I cannot see many of them keen to spend that day in a betting office.  That said, it is up to the individual bookmaker to decide whether or not to remain open.  However, it will probably spread the cake more thinly rather than increasing the turnover and revenue for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe extending the opening hours of betting offices until 10 p.m. will have serious consequences for many people working in the industry.  We should not rush into this decision which imposes major changes in their work practices. It is important time be given to staff to understand these changes and allow them make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>Over the past year, there have been major changes in betting throughout the world.  The amount of betting on American sporting events has increased enormously.  The advent of the Internet has made a new market available to us. At least 100 firms throughout the world bet using the Internet, mainly on sporting events.  Golf, tennis and some big fights are the most popular attractions.  Some of the Caribbean Islands and other small islands are offering&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>They are, but as regards betting, an attraction exists there which many bookmakers have taken up.  A special licence is granted whereby no tax is charged if betting occurs <i>via</i> the Internet and on the telephone.  The betting is tax-free but the number of telephonists required to run the operation is such that enormous employment is created.  It is something we should examine.  We should be at the head of the queue rather than at the back.  Some British firms have moved to take up these licences.  In many cases, they work in areas where the infrastructure and technology would not be as good as in Ireland.  I appeal to the Minister to examine the operation in some of these countries to see how best we can avail of it.  It provides employment, it has great potential and it is something the Minister should explore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan" hpid="Mr. C. Lenihan Mr. C. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not dwell on the vagaries and intricacies of betting offices and race courses. I will leave that to my colleague from Kildare, the Minister, who has a great interest in this area.  I am concerned that small betting office operators, as opposed to large multiple operators, are not disadvantaged by the longer opening hours.  It might be helpful if the Minister were to consult widely with the industry before embarking on the new opening hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has tended to fasten on the recent dispute concerning credit unions.  In my constituency I am reminded almost every day of the valuable work being done by credit unions in areas of disadvantage and also in areas that are not necessarily disadvantaged.  They perform a very valuable function.  The Minister is to be congratulated on what I can only describe as a very commendable <Col N="456" /> climb-down.  It is sometimes looked at askance in politics when politicians perform what the media often derisively refer to as a U-turn. Sometimes a U-turn or climb-down is commendable. It shows the Minister is listening to public opinion and to the interest group involved, namely, the credit unions.</P>
    <P>This controversy is replete with irony in that some of the suggestions contained in the Finance Bill were proposed by the leaders of the credit unions.  This suggests that they may be out of touch with the views and opinions of the membership. These opinions were made clear to me during the past few days as I travelled around my constituency &mdash; credit union members did not want these measures.  Among a certain group of people in my own area, there was a distinct worry about the issue and innumerable people were contemplating taking their money out of credit unions because they felt some threat was being posed to them.  That worry has now been dispelled.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will concentrate in the months ahead on widening the role of credit unions.  Nationally, 60 to 70 per cent of companies are described as small companies with a handful of employees.  In some cases these are described as micro-businesses.  Such businesses find it difficult to get access to capital funds to invest in their business in order to create jobs and profits for themselves and their employees.  Perhaps when the Minister sits down with the leaders of the credit union movement he will consider carefully extending their role so that they can play a major part in the development not just of individuals but of companies, small start-up companies in particular.</P>
    <P>Credit unions are involved in an area of business which has been sadly neglected or even deserted by mainstream banks.  It is known to everybody that the main banks are not interested in the small customer to the same extent as they were in the early 1970s when, amid intense competition, they were literally jostling with each other for the custom of ordinary holders of deposit or current accounts.  That is not the case now.  During a radio debate the other day somebody suggested that 50 per cent of the public do not have a current account.  That is serious and it is an area in which the credit unions can play a part.  We should widen their social mandate in relation to the social economy.  Partnership boards and county enterprise boards are two examples of where credit unions could play a much more creative role in developing a sense of social equity within our economy.  There is not much point in politics or an economy without social equity and without social justice.  County enterprise boards are a success in terms of creating micro-businesses.  Credit unions could have a very formidable role, in their relationship with county enterprise boards, in creating businesses, often in areas of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The economy today is facing three distinct challenges.  These must have been uppermost in <Col N="457" /> the mind of the Minister for Finance when he was framing his Finance Bill and his budget.  The three challenges are clear.  One is the challenge of our participation as an economy and as a country in economic and monetary union which will start in May and reach its ultimate expression in 2002 when cash and notes will be in circulation signifying a single currency throughout the Continent or land mass of Europe.  The second, on the domestic front, is the issue of tax equity.  Anybody who is old enough will remember that in 1979 hundreds of thousands of people, members of trade unions, employers, ordinary people, took to the streets of Dublin and other parts of the country in protest at the punitive levels of taxation that existed then and which, to a certain extent, still exist.  That was a very serious move, one of the great landmark political, socio-economic events in our public life.  The sight of thousands of people taking to the streets to protest about taxation was comparable in its own way &mdash; although I do not wish to push this comparison &mdash; with the unemployment marches of the 1950s. It was indicative of a population who had simply had enough that they were taking to the streets and demanding that the political system respond. The political system has responded, so much so that it would appear the people who originally championed the idea of tax cuts, the Progressive Democrats, are now politically on the wane, because the mainstream parties, including my own and the parties opposite, have taken up the challenge of reducing the burden of taxation on the ordinary individual.</P>
    <P>Tax equity is at the centre of this budget. Members opposite, including Deputy Rabbitte, sometimes depict this budget as a rich person's budget.  That is not the case.  One of the myths in relation to this budget and other budgets is that by reducing the higher tax rate one is somehow disproportionately helping the better off.  This is simply not the case.  A single person can go into the higher rates of tax on an income as low as £12,000 or £13,000.  That is very serious and demands change, a reduction in the rates, both higher and lower.  It is important to remember that this Government is committed to reducing the lower rate of tax to 25 per cent over its lifetime. We are starting out on that road.</P>
    <P>In regard to economic and monetary union, it is important also to remember that the changes relating to corporation tax are very much in line with what the European Union wants us to do. We have an indicative target of 12.5 per cent corporation tax that we have to reach.  We are hopeful of reaching that before 2002.  It is important that we make some movement towards that early on.  It is important, as we face into perhaps the greatest competitive challenge this economy has ever faced, that our industry, businesses and firms are competitive and not overtaxed in terms of corporation tax.  The reduction in corporation tax is welcome.  Deputy Rabbitte and others will remember that in the 1980s we had periods of sustained growth without a knock-on effect in <Col N="458" /> terms of employment.  We are now going into what could be described as a &ldquo;virtuous&rdquo; circle where, year on year, we are achieving growth figures that are unparalleled in other European and global economies.  We are achieving a significant reduction also in levels of unemployment.  I believe the employment pickup will improve, but it will require radical action by the Government, and that will have to be done if we are to reduce the still significantly high level of unemployment relative to the growth rates year on year of 6-7 per cent.  It is not acceptable and has to be addressed.</P>
    <P>We have to be able to convert the benefits of our booming economy into tangible employment. Tax equity is at the centre of this issue.  Some people depicted the reduction in capital gains tax as a move against the notion of tax equity but it is not.  A number of people, including the stock exchange authorities and business people, have made this point for years.  Sadly, those appeals fell on deaf ears.  The issue is how we can guarantee more investment in our domestic industry.  We must add to the liquidity of the stock exchange so that finances are available for reinvestment in capital formation ensuring access to funds for Irish companies which have found such funds so difficult to obtain.  The reduction in capital gains tax should be seen in this light.  It is a positive move to create a capital formation within the economy so that our entrepreneurs have access to funds in order to grow their firms.</P>
    <P>It is often forgotten that we are extremely dependent on trade and exports.  Deputy Quinn noted some years ago that Ireland exports more of its GNP <i>per capita</i> than Japan which has long been regarded as the unrivalled export economy. Japan has difficulties now but for the past 20 years it was seen as an economy exporting dynamically from a small island base &mdash; not unlike our situation.  It is important that we reduce the burden of capital gains tax so that there is reinvestment in Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The serious issue of social exclusion is now being addressed.  In Government Deputy Rabbitte played a role in championing drugs task forces and other issues.  More recently he spoke about the £20 million which became £30 million. I am glad this happened as a result of pressure from Deputy Rabbitte and others, including those in Government.  In addition to the challenge of joining the single currency and tax equity, social exclusion is the third challenge facing us.  It is not right that in an economy as successful as ours we are experiencing huge skills shortages which cannot be filled from the ranks of the unemployed. This highlights a serious situation and I hope the Minister will take note that investment in education and training has to be increased over the next few years to resolve this problem.  The Government has already committed £30 million to youth development and tackling the drugs problem which is at the centre of the difficulties experienced in disadvantaged areas.  It is the soul-destroying social problem which is cutting away <Col N="459" /> at disadvantaged communities.  It is must be tackled first.</P>
    <P>I welcome the budgetary measures extending tax relief for corporations or individuals who invest in disadvantaged schools.  I hope this scheme is allowed to develop to the maximum extent.  Deputy Rabbitte will share my concern at the lack of resources and teachers available in many disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>This is a positive budget which takes on a number of issues such as membership of the single currency, the vital and difficult issue of tax equity and social exclusion.  We must have a debate on public spending and how it can be reduced, particularly in the context of the reductions in Structural Funds.  I implore the Minister to examine the neglected issue of private investment in the public capital programme.  We will not be able to complete all of the capital and infrastructural projects begun in the past 20 years.  We will have to look to the private sector for a lead.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look at the developing area of electronic commerce.  This has huge significance for employment.  We must find ways to provide incentives for our businesses, schools and communities so that we can compete with the maximum competitive edge in the era of electronic commerce.  This sector is most developed in North America but, inevitably, it will come to these shores.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>deploring the punitive measures directed against the credit union movement,</P>
      <P>regretting the failure to use the available resources to help those on low and middle incomes by significantly increasing allowances and widening bands,</P>
      <P>condemning the provision to cut the rate of capital gains tax by half, which will result in a £40 million bonanza for speculators,</P>
      <P>declines to give a second reading to the Bill.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the comments made by Deputy Lenihan.  However, I sharply disagree on the main purpose and effect of the budget which ought to be concerned with the issues of social exclusion and tax equity but has had the opposite, regressive effect.  Deputies Power and Lenihan are the only two Government backbenchers to have spoken.  They have both been stung by the consensus outside the House that this was a rich man's budget.  Both referred to this and are obviously aggrieved by it, as are most of their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Lenihan and Power might find it difficult to stomach criticism of the budget from me.  In order to respond to the points made by Deputy Lenihan, <Col N="460" /> I will refer to the document produced by the Conference of Religious of Ireland.  Both Deputies might be more amenable to taking instruction from that quarter.  The document states:</P>
    <P>Budget '98 consciously redistributed the benefits of economic growth to the better off. It failed to meet the Partnership 2000 commitments on social exclusion.  It will deepen the divisions in Irish society.  Frankly, it is an incredible budget given the possibilities that were available to the Minister for Finance.  This budget is an insult to the decency of Irish people who, we believe, would support a more equitable distribution of the available resources.</P>
    <P>As a result of budget '98: the gap between the poor and the better off will widen dramatically; the numbers of long-term unemployed will not be reduced substantially; housing and hospital waiting lists will persist at totally unacceptable levels; adult literacy will remain largely untackled and rural exclusion will continue as before.</P>
    <P>The list could be extended with ease.  As a result of the same budget: the take-home pay of the better off will increase substantially; the tax payable by employers on profits will be reduced; the tax burden will be moved away from profits in the long-term and the major resources in agriculture will continue going to the better off.</P>
    <P>There is something profoundly wrong within this society when it fails to give priority to tackling poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>Government could have targeted these three core issues.  It chose instead to prioritise benefits for the better off.  This may fatten the Celtic tiger but it is not progress.  Substantial resources exist yet these resources were dissipated.</P>
    <P>Government chose to allocate its resources to people already better off.  Ultimately it is a question of choices.  If poverty, unemployment and exclusion are not eliminated now given the resources that are currently available then future generations will reap the harvest of our neglect.  Budget '98 will produce a much more unequal society.</P>
    <P>That is what this Finance Bill faithfully reflects. I will add one more quote from their Reverend Superiors before I move on to my more customary secular domain.</P>
    <P>This was the best opportunity any Minister for Finance has had in a generation to reduce the divisions in Irish society.  This opportunity has been squandered.  Budget '98 had more in common with Thatcherite Britain in the mid-1980s than with any commitment to tackle social exclusion.</P>

Following lengthy consultations with both sides of industry, the Labour Party believes that the growing problem of denial of the basic civil right to trade union representation by employers can only be resolved by legislation to strengthen the long standing industrial relations procedures.</P>
      <P>The current serious trade union recognition dispute at Ryanair highlights the urgency for enhancing the powers of the Labour Court as this Bill proposes to do. While Ryanair has made a significant contribution to the growth of air transport in Ireland especially over the past five years, the success of the company is largely due to a very dedicated and hard working staff and to the policies of deregulation of the industry implemented by the State.</P>
      <P>The outrageous bullying by Ryanair management of young, poorly paid baggage handlers who wish to be represented by SIPTU is deplorable and should cease immediately.  The arrogant and insulting refusal of Ryanair management to attend a Labour Court hearing is equally reprehensible and must be addressed by this House.</P>
      <P>It is notable that commentators from across the political spectrum have condemned Ryanair's appalling attitude to the democratic wishes of its staff and to the experienced industrial relations machinery of the State.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, has rightly castigated the old fashioned &ldquo;tooth and claw capitalism&rdquo; as personified by Michael O'Leary and Ryanair management.  However, if the Taoiseach wishes to be taken seriously with regard to his comments on the behaviour of Ryanair management, he should accept this Labour Party Bill and allow it to proceed to Committee Stage.  I challenge him to do this.</P>
      <P>Although innovative in some respects, Ryanair management is a Victorian dinosaur in terms of industrial relations.  For the Labour Party and the labour movement the crass antics of Ryanair management stir unhappy memories of the birth of our great tradition.  Our founders, James Connolly and Jim Larkin &mdash; my predecessor in Dublin North East &mdash; battled similar capitalists to Mr. Ryan and Mr. O'Leary in 1912 and 1913.  Almost a century later we will not countenance the destruction of our movement's hard won civil and industrial democratic rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ryanair dispute is the latest in a series of trade union recognition disputes which have increasingly alarmed workers and their union representatives over the past decade.  Between <Col N="462" /> 1985 and 1996, for example, an average of 11 cases annually concerning trade union recognition were referred to the Labour Court.  Since 1985, at least 14 trade unions have been involved in trade union recognition disputes including SIPTU, ATGWU, MSF, MANDATE, IDATU and AEEU.  Many of these disputes have arisen in the small indigenous private sector with pay and conditions below industry norms.</P>
    <P>Some multinational companies with similar pay and conditions have also been affected.  Apart from Ryanair the number of high profile trade union recognition cases include companies such as Pat the Baker, Elan Corporation and Nolan Transport which is involved in legal action currently before the Supreme Court.  Many of these disputes were referred to the Labour Court under section 20 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969. More recently a number of such cases are being heard under section 26 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  Many leading trade unionists believe that the 1990 Act worsened several of the industrial rights of workers and the status of trade unions and should be amended by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Article 40.6.1º of the 1937 Constitution guarantees &ldquo;the right of the citizen to form associations and unions&rdquo;.  Many people regard this statement of a fundamental human right to clearly imply the right to be professionally represented by a trade union.  As one trade unionist said recently, the right to belong to a football or golf club surely means that the member might take part in football or golf.  However, the courts have interpreted article 40.6.1º as not granting a corresponding right to citizens to have their right to be professionally represented accepted by employers.</P>
    <P>In Dublin Colleges ASA <i>v.</i> City of Dublin VEC in 1981, for example, the High Court held there was no corresponding obligation on an employer to recognise a staff association for the purpose of negotiating pay and conditions of employment.  This decision mirrored an earlier judgment in Abbott &amp; Whelan <i>v.</i> ITGWU and Southern Health Board and others in 1980 when Judge McWilliam held that &ldquo;there is no duty placed on an employer to negotiate with any particular citizen or body of citizens&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course the courts and the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, recognise trade union recognition disputes as bona fide trade disputes for the purpose of allowing industrial action.  The Trade Union Recognition Bill, 1998, will strengthen the authority of the Labour Court by giving it the power to make a legally binding Employment Regulation Order in union recognition disputes. The adoption of this approach and the use of existing well tried industrial relations procedures avoids the constitutional barriers which have been erected by the courts on the issues of trade union freedom and freedom of association.</P>
    <P>There is a long tradition of voluntarism in Irish industrial relations and a reluctance to resort to legislative sanctions.  The nation has been well served over the past half century by institutions such as the Labour Court, the Labour Relations <Col N="463" /> Commission and the Employer Labour Conference. Indeed, the vast majority of Labour Court recommendations are accepted by employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>The extension of social partnership from 1987 has underpinned the incredible economic prosperity Ireland has enjoyed in this decade. However, from the PESP to Partnership 2000, deep anxiety has grown among trade unions at the failure of employers to grant recognition and the growing threat which this poses to the continuance of social partnership and economic success.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9.8 of Partnership 2000 states:</P>
    <P>Partnership is an active relationship based on recognition of a common interest to secure the competitiveness, viability and prosperity of the enterprise.  It involves a continuing commitment by employees to improvements in equality and efficiency; and the acceptance by employers of employees as stakeholders with rights and interests to be considered in the context of major decisions affecting their employment.</P>
    <P>The same paragraph established a high level group composed of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, ICTU, IBEC and the IDA to resolve the problem of non-recognition of trade unions by employers and the growing threat this posed to partnership and industrial peace.  The report of the high level group, issued before Christmas, proposed a code of practice which did not endorse the ICTU request for an enhancement of the Labour Court by giving it the power to issue a binding recommendation on pay and conditions in recognition disputes.  This Bill attempts to remedy that failure.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is determined to insist on a fair approach to the fruits of our economic prosperity. A key part of the Labour Party's fairness agenda is the resolution of trade union recognition disputes in a balanced way, taking into account the rights of workers and employers and utilising the well tried existing industrial relations process.  In drafting this legislation I have consulted with leading trade unionists, employer representatives and the IDA.  In particular I am grateful to the President of SIPTU, Mr. Jimmy Somers, for his encouragement and lengthy advice.  I also received valuable assistance from Mr. Brendan Hayes of SIPTU and Mr. Richard Humphries, the Labour Party's legal adviser.</P>
    <P>The Trade Union Recognition Bill also draws heavily on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions submission to the high level group established under Partnership 2000.  That submission, entitled &ldquo;Trade Union Recognition &mdash; The Right to Bargain&rdquo;, proposed to resolve the serious problems presented by employers who refused to allow professional representation to their staff by setting out a framework agreed between congress and employer organisations which used existing <Col N="464" /> experienced industrial relations procedures.  The framework culminated in an Employment Regulation Order on pay and conditions.  However, I have not followed the system of incremental levels of recognition proposed in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions submission.</P>
    <P>Similarly in the Bill, on behalf of the Labour Party, I have focused in a pragmatic way on procedures and outcomes rather than on the formal status of recognition.  I fully agree with the conclusions of a paper on trade union recognition in Ireland by Jack McGinley, which indicates that there are three remedies open to the Government with regard to trade union recognition without immediately going the constitutional amendment route, a route we may have to pursue at some stage.  Two of these concern a European directive &mdash; we are aware of the recent comments of Commissioner Pádraig Flynn on this matter &mdash; or a statutory code of practice from the Labour Relations Commission.  The third, an extension of the powers of the Labour Court, is the objective of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the Trade Union Recognition Bill does not interfere with the legitimate rights of either side of industry but establishes a framework within which those rights can be harmonised where a dispute arises.  The question of trade union recognition is defined as &ldquo;one of balance between the rights of both sides of the industrial relations equation&rdquo;. Where a recognition dispute arises, either party to the dispute may refer it to the Labour Relations Commission in accordance with section 1 of the Bill.  If the LRC cannot resolve the dispute, either party may then refer the matter to the Labour Court under section 2.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, the Labour Court is empowered to investigate the dispute, which may be done in private unless one of the parties requests the court to do otherwise and the court so decides.  The Labour Court will be allowed to order the taking of a ballot of the employees in the employment or any category thereof by section 4 of the Bill.  The court can decide on all aspects of the ballot, including a request to the LRC for assistance with the ballot, the category of persons entitled to vote, the manner of voting and the ballot information and facilities to be provided to employees by the union and employer.</P>
    <P>Under section 5, the Labour Court is empowered to summon witnesses and examine them on oath and require the production of any documents. Witnesses will be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if they appeared before the High Court and will be guilty of an offence if they fail to discharge their duties as witnesses to the dispute at the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the investigation, the Labour Court will issue a recommendation on the matter &mdash; section 6 &mdash; and will invite the parties to the dispute to consider the recommendation and report back within a specified period.  The court will not recommend that a trade union should be recognised for the purposes of this Act <Col N="465" />&ldquo;unless it is satisfied that the trade union is representative of employees in the employment or a substantial category thereof&rdquo;.  Under section 6 the Labour Court will not recommend in favour of trade union recognition if another union already &ldquo;stands recognised by the employer for the purposes of this Act&rdquo; for the employment or category thereof concerned in the dispute.</P>
    <P>Under section 7 &mdash; the scope of the recommendation &mdash; the Labour Court may recommend the employer to recognise a particular trade union specified in the order or any other course of action or redress the court thinks appropriate. The recommendations of the Labour Court will be in writing and will be published &mdash; sections 8 and 9.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is a key element of the Bill.  If, after the expiry of a period specified in the recommendation, the Labour Court is satisfied that the recommendation has not been complied with and is unlikely to resolve the trade union recognition dispute, the court may make an employment regulation order under section 43 of the 1946 Act in respect of the employer and the trade union specified notwithstanding that the order is not made on the proposal of a joint labour committee. Joint labour committees, which were set up under the 1946 Act, were the inspiration for this idea in the submission by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>The employment regulation order may determine pay and conditions and provide for consultation with the trade union in relation to its members in respect of any matter on which the employer is statutorily obliged to consult the employees and in relation to disciplinary proceedings affecting a member of the trade union &mdash; sections 11 and 12.  When a trade union is recognised under this Act section 12 also requires the employer to &ldquo;negotiate in good faith with the trade union in respect of pay and conditions&rdquo; of its members.  This provision applies only if the employer decides to recognise the trade union.  If he refuses recognition, section 10 applies.</P>
    <P>Given that the employer who refuses to engage with a trade union, which can show that it represents a substantial number of employees either across the whole workforce or in a particular grade or category, faces the option of having the Labour Court determine in a legally binding manner critical employment issues such as pay and conditions, the Bill can be seen as giving the employer a powerful incentive to bargain.  It is hoped that in many employments where there are fair pay and conditions this would not need to come into existence because the demand for a trade union would not arise.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the important matter of whether a trade union is representative of the employees in a recognition dispute.  The union will be held to be representative of the employees by the Labour Court &ldquo;if it represents a substantial number of the employees concerned&rdquo; and &ldquo;whether or not it represents all or a majority.&rdquo; That applies to a category of employment as well <Col N="466" /> as the employment itself.  As the explanatory memorandum outlines, this provision accords with the decision in &ldquo;Federation of Irish Rail and Road Workers-v-Great Southern Railways (1942) where it was held that a trade union which represented about one-third of employees was sufficiently representative for the purposes of a statutory provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the dismissal of an employee for reasons related to the seeking of trade union recognition shall be an unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals, Act, 1977 &mdash; section 14.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for summary proceedings for an offence under this Act to be instituted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. An offence committed by a body corporate and which is proved to have had the consent or connivance of or be attributable to the neglect on the part of a director, manager, secretary or similar officer of the body corporate shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the legal sanctions applying to an employment regulation order of the Labour Court will apply to an employer who refuses to bargain in good faith under this Act.  If the employer continues to refuse to comply with an employment regulation order of the Labour Court in a trade union recognition dispute, he will leave himself open to the usual forms of legal redress for employers under the Industrial Relations Act, 1946.  These include continuous fines and civil actions by employees for back pay and unlimited damages and, in addition, the employer is open to injunctions until the dispute is resolved.</P>
    <P>Section 19 gives the Minister power to make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to the Act.  Section 20, the penultimate section, defines &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; as including an excepted body within the meaning of section 6 of the Trade Union Act, 1941.  That is an important section. This follows the precedent set by my colleague, the former Minister for Labour Affairs, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald in the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  The former Minister thus permitted staff associations and works councils to collectively bargain on working time issues.  Of course, such non-trade union bodies obviously need to demonstrate their independence from an employer if they are to be accepted as bone fide employee representatives.  The inclusion of non-union employee representative bodies within the scope of the Trade Union Recognition Bill, 1998, therefore, gives it a much wider remit than trade unions alone.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party is putting in place here a mechanism whereby any employee can achieve fairness as regards their pay and conditions even if their employer refuses to deal with a trade union.  This provision will also prove very helpful to employees in non-union, multinational companies, which have employee representative bodies under a human resource management structure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> Having outlined the Bill before us, I would like to deal with some of the potential objections to its enactment into law.  It may be said that this Bill will be a potential deterrence to US multinationals locating and operating in Ireland.  We have already heard the Taoiseach sing that mantra and we will possibly hear the Minister, Deputy Kitt, sing it tonight.  The Bill poses no threat whatsoever to the human resource policies of multinationals.  First, there is no suggestion in the Bill that unions will be imposed on employees who do not wish to be represented by a union. Past experience in the court ensures employers are protected in that regard.</P>
    <P>The procedures outlined in the Bill become triggered only when a &ldquo;substantial number&rdquo; of employees in an employment or a category of employment voluntarily join or are involved. Second, the Labour Court will make a legally binding award only if it finds that pay and conditions are out of line with industry norms.  Most multinationals contend they have pay and benefit packages above such norms, making union membership irrelevant.  If that is true, they should have no cause for concern.  On the other hand, if it is not true, the employees of such companies should have a fair rate of pay and decent conditions.</P>
    <P>On the broader issue of attracting US and other multinationals to Ireland, it is generally agreed that factors other than union membership have played a far greater role.  These include our outstanding and increasingly technological education system.  The recent ESRI report drew attention to the fact that the education system, with the outstanding teachers and parents' court, is one of the best and most technological systems in the world.  I commend the Government on the initiative it took in that regard.  Other factors include our social partnership in the economy and political stability, our entry within a few short months into the Euro zone and, perhaps most of all, the fact that we speak the leading international language of technology and business as a native language.</P>
    <P>It has been noticeable that in multinational areas where disputes have arisen about trade union membership, some of the companies that wished to be non-trade union companies here had a trade union tradition abroad.  In regard to the current Ryanair dispute, the airline on which Ryanair is modelled, with a low cost culture, is South Western Airlines, one of the most successful companies on the New York stock exchange. Even though it was the model for the success of Ryanair, South Western Airlines is a highly unionised company.</P>
    <P>We reject the suggestion that the Bill is an abandonment of the voluntarist approach to industrial relations.  Recent years have seen increasing legislation of the employment relationship, with more and more aspects of the employment contract being decided by law.</P>
    <P>In the early 1970s there was only a handful of employment law covering holidays, redundancies <Col N="468" /> and employment conditions, such as the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  In addition to equality legislation, we now have laws on unfair dismissals, collective redundancies, transfer of undertakings, European works councils, working time and part-time workers.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, had agreed with me some months ago we would also have been delighted to put the Shop Workers' Bill on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>There is also impending legislation on parental leave, while Brussels is examining the questions of national level works councils and contract employment.  Recent speeches by the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Pádraig Flynn, have brought these issues to our attention.  The &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; in our former volunterist system of industrial relations has become extremely circumscribed, perhaps because of the impact of the modern economy and the traditions of European industrial relations into which we have been integrating over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Trade Union Recognition Bill, 1998 does not oblige an employer to recognise and/or deal with a trade union for all purposes.  It does, however, put a procedure in place whereby the Labour Court can examine an employer's pay and conditions, including health and safety provisions, in relation to particular groups of employees and issue a legally binding decision on pay and conditions.  Health and safety provisions are a central feature of the Ryanair baggage handlers' dispute.</P>
    <P>If the employer refuses to co-operate with the court or accept a trade union recommendation, the court will proceed on the evidence before it from the union.  In such circumstances, it is in the employer's interest to co-operate with the court.</P>
    <P>The procedure outlined in this Bill is not dissimilar to the procedures already followed in equal pay claims.  If such a claim cannot be resolved with an employer, it is subsequently referred to an equality officer who investigates it and then issues a legally binding decision.  Either party is free to appeal a decision to the Labour Court and ultimately to the courts.  With the imminent passage of the revised Employment Equality Bill, 1997, these redress procedures will be extended to allow claims to be made on all of the discrimination grounds of age, race and so on.</P>
    <P>Claims under the Employment Equality Bill can be presented by individuals or groups and, as the operation of the existing equality legislation shows, some claimants will be represented by trade unions and some by solicitors or barristers. The employer does not have to deal with unions or solicitors at all.  He or she makes his or her case to the equality officer and must show that pay and conditions are not discriminatory.</P>
    <P>Fears may be expressed that to allow the Labour Court to decide on the pay and conditions of one group of employees could upset an organisation's complete pay structures.  However, exactly the same arguments can be advanced against existing and impending equality legislation, especially since the European Court has opened <Col N="469" /> the door to claims of indirect discrimination.  The recent £100,000 award to four employees of the Irish Aviation Authority and the current discussions about the incremental and promotional rights of job sharers are cases in point.  The awards certainly upset existing pay and relativity structures but only because those structures were illegal in the first place.  While a Labour Court decision under the Trade Union Recognition Bill would not declare an organisation's pay and conditions to be illegal, it would amount to saying they were unfair and should be changed.  That would often be the reason many workers would demand the right to join a trade union in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The fundamental case for this Bill is the absolute necessity of fairness for citizens in all walks of life.  That is the essential ideology of the Labour Party and the entire labour movement. SIPTU has rightly advanced the argument during the Ryanair dispute that, as in other walks of life, employees are entitled to professional representation in negotiations over pay and conditions. Mr. Paul O'Sullivan, a SIPTU official, noted that when Mr. Michael O'Leary received his first £14 million bounty from the share flotation of Ryanair, later to become £17 million, he would have received professional advice in his dealings with the owners of the airline.  It would seem that he should at least afford the same basic privilege to the lowest paid of his workers who now seek trade union recognition and professional representation.</P>
    <P>The list of employment legislation to which I have referred gives added weight to this argument. No ordinary employee can be expected to be familiar with the intricacies of this legislation. How can employees be expected to make effective representations, on their own behalf, in negotiations with experienced professional personnel or human resource managers without experienced professional trade union negotiators to guide them?</P>
    <P>Even in EU countries, such as the Netherlands, where trade union membership stands at approximately 30 per cent of the total workforce, the argument in favour of professional trade union representation is accepted by most employers.  In the literature which I consulted during the preparation of this Bill, I noted that employers in countries such as the Netherlands often prefer to deal with professional trade union representatives rather than people on the shop floor as trade unions have a great deal of experience in negotiation.</P>
    <P>At recent meetings on the Ryanair dispute, several Fianna Fáil Deputies with trade union experience &mdash; that exotic breed &mdash; indicated their support for trade union recognition.  One Deputy, who hails from my own constituency, spoke of fighting for this principle &ldquo;till the blood ran down his face&rdquo;.  I am not calling on this Deputy to take such drastic measures yet but l believe he and his colleagues must walk through the lobby in support of this Bill or else be seen as hypocrites.  The <Col N="470" /> Taoiseach and his brother, Deputy Brady and others would, in the past, have adopted the same attitude as the Fianna Fáil Deputy to whom I referred.  Will they now fundamentally betray their own people's basic civil right and vote against their own history?  I hope they will not and I hope the Taoiseach will accept this Bill and put in on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>I call on the Taoiseach himself to lead these Deputies and allow them to retain some honour and credibility by accepting this Bill.  The Labour Party believes the Bill, as it stands, is an important contribution to Irish industrial relations but we would be willing to accept reasonable amendments on Committee Stage which would preserve the central thrust of the Bill, namely, to resolve the problems of non-recognition of workers' chosen representatives in their trade unions by strengthening our existing experience and institutions, particularly the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a modest proposal as we are not proposing generalised mandatory recognition.  I make no apologies for bringing forward a modest proposal which is hopefully balanced to recognise the rights of both sides of industry.  This Bill is not a blunt instrument of mandatory recognition but a carefully tailored exercise to establish a framework in which trade union recognition disputes can be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party insists that it is the job of the Dáil to put in place laws which ensure that citizens are treated fairly.  It cannot be denied by most fair observers that, in the Ryanair dispute and other disputes over trade union recognition, very low paid workers and workers who experience difficult work conditions have been treated very unfairly and have been denied the fundamental constitutional right to be represented by a professional trade union.</P>
    <P>Until recently, the pay and conditions of the great majority of workers were organised by collective negotiations.  With a significant growth in the number of employers who do not want to deal with unions, a clear responsibility lies with legislators to ensure that citizens are dealt with in a fair manner in the workplace.  This is what the Trade Union Recognition Bill, 1998, is designed to do and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely and comprehensive Bill prepared by my colleague, Deputy Broughan.  It is with a good deal of pride and pleasure as a member of the Irish Labour Party and the labour movement that I take the opportunity to speak on the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Broughan has provided a comprehensive overview of the background to, and detail of, the Bill.  I would like to speak about its wider benefits to Irish industry and social partnership. Deputy Broughan has been researching and <Col N="471" /> drafting this Bill since late summer of last year.  I was interested to read newspaper reports at the weekend which indicated that Fianna Fáil spin doctors were attempting to portray the introduction of this Bill as a cynical exercise.  Nothing could be further from the truth and it is disreputable of certain individuals to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Broughan pointed out, since 1986 at least 14 trade unions have been involved in recognition disputes.  Many of these disputes have occurred in small companies where either the owner or the management have attempted to bully or, worse, to intimidate workers who wished to join trade unions and to be professionally represented by a trade union in negotiations with their employers.</P>
    <P>My party colleague, in researching and drafting this Bill, consulted widely in the trade union movement, with employers' groups and with other interested parties.  He has drawn from existing case law regarding trade unions and he has had the foresight to take account of the submission of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to the high level group established under Partnership 2000 to consider this issue.  The Bill was presented to and debated by the Labour Parliamentary Party and I wholeheartedly welcome the opportunity to speak on it tonight.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extensively researched and is supported by the trade union movement.  If this Government has good sense it will accept the Bill. It will make a substantial difference to the lives of many ordinary people whose rights have been trampled upon by certain disreputable employers. The principle the Bill elaborates on and protects is central to the successful operation of the economy. Of the many factors which have contributed to the recent upturn in the economy, social partnership and cohesion have been the most important.  In that regard, I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, who played a constructive role in developing the present system of social partnership.  It has proved of immense worth to the economy and of great practical assistance to workers and employers in addition to other sectors of society.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is aware that the logic behind the operation of social partnership dictates that the Trade Union Recognition Bill must be allowed to proceed.  Trade union leaders in recent weeks have issued warnings about the strain the current Ryanair dispute is putting on Partnership 2000.  This follows a budget which was deeply unpopular with the trade union movement, particularly trade unions which represent people on low pay.  The Taoiseach is aware of the concerns of the trade union movement regarding the direction his Government is taking and the role being assumed by some employers.  Tonight he is presented with an opportunity to address those concerns by accepting this Bill.  It will be another slap in the face for workers and the trade union movement if the Government cynically rejects it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> The Government cannot put Partnership 2000 at further risk.  It is aware of the seriousness of the current situation and it cannot hope to sit idly by in the expectation that the Ryanair dispute will dissipate.  The continuance of social partnership requires real involvement by the Government of the day.  It is incumbent on the Government to send a strong signal to Irish workers and to the trade union movement of its commitment to deepening social partnership.  The opportunity to do so is presented tonight and it should not be allowed pass.</P>
    <P>The principle of trade union recognition is central to the welfare of many workers.  As economies develop and expand, negotiations regarding pay, conditions, health and safety become ever more complex.  It is not reasonable for ordinary workers who are often raising families to be expected to adequately present their case to employers, human resource managers and, increasingly, professional consultants.  It is unfair and unrealistic to expect such workers to be able to engage in that type of activity.  To do that effectively they need the advice, help, resources and experience of the trade union movement.  That is becoming increasingly obvious as that movement, in the last 20 to 25 years, has consolidated to such a degree that a high level of research and expertise is available to people who represent workers.</P>
    <P>The workers in Ryanair want to have that level of professional representation at their disposal. They want to benefit from the best case possible being made on their behalf when they get involved in negotiations with their company.  No more than that is being sought.  They seek a level playing field, if that cliché can be used, when they enter negotiations with employers.  It is unfair and improper to expect workers to remain as gifted amateurs, as it were, making their case against hard-boiled professionals who have a range of data and consultancy expertise on which they can draw.  It is unrealistic to expect workers to compete in that environment.  The workers in Ryanair are seeking to make their case on a fair basis and by resorting to the best professional advice available. That is their objective in seeking recognition of their trade union.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a progressive step in the history of industrial relations and in the development and deepening of the social partnership and cohesion which has fundamentally underpinned the success of the Irish economy.  I congratulate Deputy Broughan on his hard work in producing it.  It is not a gimmick or opportunistic response to the Ryanair problem.  The Deputy was given responsibility for the Bill after the 1997 general election and what is before the House is a fine tribute to his efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to identify what I perceive as important common ground between all parties in the House. There is a shared view of the major contribution by trade unions and the workers they represent <Col N="473" /> to the economy and to society and the importance of continuing the current national partnership.  I acknowledge the Deputy's comments about the Taoiseach who played a significant role in building that partnership.  There is also a shared view of the importance of extending that spirit of partnership from the national level to the level of enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to chapter nine of Partnership 2000 which sets out an important series of actions to extend partnership at the enterprise level.  Moreover, by injecting further resources into the Labour Relations Commission for modernising the industrial relations system, it has demonstrated its commitment to addressing the industrial relations challenges arising from national and international competitive trends, such as furthering joint management of change and finding ways of avoiding crisis driven change, strengthening the negotiating capacities of parties at the workplace level by building up effective practices, procedures and structures and by assisting the parties at workplace level in their exploration of new manufacturing concepts and new attempts to forge principles and models for the conduct of industrial relations.</P>
      <P>I also share many of the concerns expressed about the dispute at Ryanair.  The Taoiseach has been forthright in his views on this matter and I am at one with him in this regard.  It is a matter of considerable disquiet that the dispute at Ryanair is continuing.  I regret that the company declined the recent invitation of the Labour Court.  The Labour Court provided the parties with an opportunity to clarify the issues, as it is most important to establish the facts in this dispute. What has Ryanair to fear about discussing this matter in the Labour Court?  In doing so it will go some way to re-establishing trust between management and the workforce in dispute.</P>
      <P>There has been a public debate about this matter and calls from a number of quarters for action. A period of reflection by the parties to the dispute is now called for.  I urge the company to consider how it proposes to manage its human resources now that it has become a substantial employer and a major player in the Irish airlines business.  I urge the employees and SIPTU to examine how they can best contribute to the development of the company and the attainment of improved working conditions.</P>
      <P>Confrontation or coercion of either party is not the way forward.  Perhaps the parties, in the course of their reflections, could examine the partnership provisions in Partnership 2000.  Other companies and their employees have taken the partnership route already; others are attempting to do so.  Why should the situation at Ryanair be any different?</P>

      <P>I have been and remain in contact with the parties with a view to finding the means <Col N="474" /> towards a resolution.  In addition, the chairperson of the Labour Court has confirmed that the court is keeping the matter under review and is prepared to facilitate the parties in any way.  I urge Ryanair to take up the Labour Court offer.  For the Governments' part, we will not hesitate to use such powers as we have to contribute to the settlement of the dispute.  Ultimately the responsibility for the resolution of this dispute rests with the parties directly involved.</P>
      <P>It should not be overlooked that union recognition, though long time an issue, with occasional high profile disputes, is not a perpetual preoccupation. The number of recognition disputes dealt with in the Labour Court in recent years was ten in 1979; 17 in 1994; nine in 1995; and seven in 1996.  I understand that in the Labour Relations Commission the numbers vary between 1 per cent and 3 per cent of all cases.</P>
      <P>In interpreting these data it is well to remember that some recognition disputes relate not to the issue of recognition <i>per se</i> but to grades not unionised in a unionised company and to inter-union transferability and resultant recognition issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, I would emphasise the necessity of not approaching this issue of trade union recognition in isolation from developments which are taking place in the European Union and both our inward investment and trading partner countries. Recent EU enactments in this area are confined to consultation and information mechanisms and employee representative structures and did not specifically legislate for compulsory trade union recognition.</P>
      <P>We simply cannot deal with this matter in isolation from wider economic developments.  Nor should we deal with it in the context of a localised dispute in an indigenous Irish company, no matter how much we might dislike the present situation.</P>
      <P>The Government is keenly aware of the contribution that trade unions have made, and continue to make, to economic and social developments. Social partnership has facilitated the social partners to work together with the Government in the development of the prosperity and competitiveness of the economy.  Advances in social inclusion have also been substantially facilitated and indeed brought about by this working together.</P>
      <P>The development of social partnership and its very inception have been largely based on the long tradition of free collective bargaining in the industrial relations arena.  It is in the context of this free collective bargaining that progress on trade union recognition is to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the parties in the House have supported voluntarism in industrial relations. lndeed, only last Friday in a debate in this House on aviation policy Deputy Owen warned that it would be a bad day for management and trade unions if words such as &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; were to become part of the language of industrial relations.  Yet, that is precisely what this <Col N="475" /> Bill seeks to do, to introduce coercion and mandatory sanctions into the industrial relations arena.  The Government does not and cannot support the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the proposers of the Bill should seek to undermine the voluntary industrial relations system and its institutions &mdash; the Labour Court and Labour Relations Commission &mdash; which provide such valuable assistance to the resolution of industrial relations disputes.  The impact of this would be to undermine the effectiveness of the Labour Court, in particular by assigning to the court a quasi-judicial role which would undoubtedly lead to litigation in industrial relations disputes.</P>
    <P>A survey conducted by the Labour Court in 1995 found that 84 per cent of its recommendations were accepted by the parties concerned. This is also mirrored in the 1996 report of the Labour Relations Commission where it indicated that 81 per cent of cases that year were settled at conciliation stage.  The success of the system would appear to be soundly based on the voluntarist nature of the industrial relations machinery. Both the Labour Court and the commission deal with more than 2,000 collective bargaining cases per annum where non-compulsory recommendations or voluntary settlements are issued.</P>
    <P>The evidence everywhere is that highly legislative and adversarial procedures run the risk of creating adversarial collective bargaining relationships from the very outset.  Yes, trade union recognition is a complex, difficult and controversial area.  The social partners and the Government ought to work together to achieve progress.  This Bill is not the way to encourage co-operation between management and employees and their representatives.</P>
    <P>This Bill is ill-timed, ill-conceived and appears to have been formulated rather hastily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will demonstrate my contentions in my references to the main provisions in the Bill.  First, I wish to set out my broad concerns. There is an adverse impact on industrial relations in it.  By assigning a quasi-judicial role to the Labour Court in one area of industrial relations, the Bill undermines the effectiveness of the court in assisting settlement of other types of disputes.  In addition, the involvement of the law courts in trade union recognition is likely to raise the general industrial relations temperature; to introduce a fundamental level of compulsion within the system is to depart from its essential voluntarist underpinnings.  This could lead in future circumstances to other areas of compulsion in industrial relations which would be anathema to both employers and the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of final arbitration and determination between employers and their employees as a group in the field can only be resolved through an agreed voluntary machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An assumption that an employer will concede recognition for collective bargaining purposes <Col N="477" /> rather than face the threat of statutory minimum pay and conditions appears to underlie this Bill; that faced with the threat of having pay and conditions in his enterprise settled by Labour Court order the employer will opt for union recognition, in other words &ldquo;talk now or pay later&rdquo;.  It is highly debatable that employers will behave like that; the more likely route is the one of litigation.  The proposal is not a convincing strategy to bring about trade union recognition.</P>
    <P>There will be damage to investment in jobs, especially foreign direct investment.  There is no doubt in my mind that mandatory trade union recognition &mdash; and changed policies that are perceived as leading to trade union recognition &mdash; would impact adversely and substantially on inward investment and employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, there will be threats to the continuation of the voluntary social partnership that has contributed substantially to economic and social life.</P>
      <P>The hub of the Bill is in sections 7, 10, 11 and 12.  These sections seek to coerce an employer to recognise a trade union for the purposes of collective bargaining on pay and conditions and information and consultation for the trade union itself. What is proposed in section 10 in relation to the making of an employment regulation order in respect of a particular employer is very much at variance with the process and procedures by which employment regulation orders are made at present.  Already some 150,000 workers are covered by the system.</P>
      <P>The essence of the JLC system is that it provides a real opportunity for the social partners to work together to establish and maintain minimum pay and conditions.  The rates of pay and conditions of employment which are to be set down in an order, are the subject of discussion and negotiation in the particular joint labour committee, which is representative of the employers and workers in the sector to which the committee applies.  When rates of pay and conditions of employment are agreed by a committee they are submitted in the form of proposals to the Labour Court.  When the court accepts the proposals it makes the necessary ERO.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the type of employment regulation order proposed in section 10 is fundamentally different from the existing employment regulation <Col N="478" /> orders provided for in the industrial relations Acts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I question the appropriateness of adopting the existing ERO mechanism for the purpose proposed by section 10.  The use of employment regulation orders as a threat, as proposed in the Bill, will undermine rather than allow full preliminary conciliation as claimed by the proposers in their explanatory memorandum.</P>
      <P>Co-operative industrial relations, involving full conciliation where appropriate, are a key factor in the maintenance of enterprise competitiveness. Threats, coercion and litigation will not encourage co-operative industrial relations and thus will damage competitiveness &mdash; competitiveness in enterprises and the economy's competitiveness in terms of attracting internationally mobile investment. The spectre of industrial relations battles in the courts will not maintain the international perception that Ireland is a positive place in which to locate foreign investment.  Without such investment, our ability to create the jobs that we need to maintain and improve workers' living standards will be seriously eroded.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that Deputy Broughan is so knowledgeable as to say that if his Bill is passed, nothing will change.</P>

      <P>There is one further point about the impact of the Bill, in practical and perception terms, on foreign direct investment.  It has been argued in the past apropos this kind of provision that it is likely that the multinationals will not be affected by the Bill because their pay and working conditions are good and employees are not seeking to join trade unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned the introduction of threat and coercion into the industrial relations arena will undermine that voluntary social partnership. From start to finish this Bill unleashes <Col N="479" /> considerable potential for litigation and division, directing the parties down the road to confrontation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which Deputy Broughan clearly enjoys.</P>
      <P>Trade union recognition disputes have their origins in concern about pay and other working conditions.  The Bill ignores this reality by placing exclusive concentration on providing a role for the Labour Relations Commission in the recognition element of disputes.  This is not the way to facilitate full preliminary conciliation in disputes. In any event, the possibility of referral to the LRC of all the issues in an industrial relations dispute is already provided for in section 26 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  Procedures which are slanted towards recognition are likely to make it more difficult to resolve the pay and conditions element of recognition disputes through dialogue and conciliation, not least because any negotiations on those matters take place under the shadow of ultimate Labour Court action.</P>
      <P>While section 10 acknowledges that the ultimate issues to be resolved in recognition disputes are those relating to pay and conditions, it would be more constructive to place the emphasis on pay and conditions at the beginning of the process rather than at its end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This was the thrust of the work of the high level group which reported to the Tánaiste before the end of 1997, and which Government and the social partners wish to reconvene to finish the work.  I will return to that matter.</P>
      <P>Section 3 sets the scene for the legalistic or statutory approach to the area of trade union recognition which is the basic thrust of the Bill, by setting out certain procedures for Labour Court investigations and by providing ministerial powers for the laying down of more procedures by regulations.  This approach of statutory procedures for the Labour Court is at variance with the way in which the court has operated in the industrial relations area since its establishment in 1947.  The long standing freedom of the court to set its own procedures has contributed in no small way to the effectiveness of the court's dispute settling services.  The Bill compels the Labour Court to investigate every dispute referred.  The court has no discretion.  The obligation to investigate is all the more significant because section 2 empowers either of the parties to refer &mdash; not joint referral &mdash; a dispute to the Labour Court.  I am, therefore concerned at the departure, provided for in this section, from the traditional freedom of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> Granting the Labour Court powers to order a ballot during its investigation of a recognition dispute is also likely to bring it into controversy.  The Bill does not state what the ballot is to be about. Such a serious omission leaves the court in an invidious position, especially in terms of possible litigation.  This difficulty is added to by another omission.  Section 4 does not provide a basis on which the Labour Court is to take its decision to order a ballot.  These omissions illustrate the undue haste with which the Bill was prepared.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that the ordering of a ballot by the Labour Court may undermine the present stature of the court as an industrial dispute settling agency.  This undermining is particularly likely if there are difficulties about the ballot. For example, the taking of a ballot may encourage confrontation.  The trade union will seek the maximum support for a ballot which it favours whereas management may seek to discourage such support.  Experience on the taking of ballots relating to union recognition in, for example, the US is that confrontation does arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will involve the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission in this confrontation &mdash; a scenario likely to damage the stature and ultimately the effectiveness of both.  The Deputy obviously likes confrontation and I know what he is about.  He has let the cat out of the bag.</P>
      <P>There are other provisions in the Bill which grant the Labour Court powers that give it a quasi-judicial or tribunal status.  Can we really expect the Labour Court to exercise two very different roles in the industrial relations arena, on the one hand, to provide a voluntary dispute settling service and, on the other, to assume the role of a tribunal or court of law?  The powers for the Labour Court in the section are akin to the powers conferred on the Employment Appeals Tribunal. However, the roles of the two bodies have been very different, notwithstanding that the court has functions in relation to statutory rights, for example, appeals in employment equality cases.  This assignment of powers to the court similar to those of the Employment Appeals Tribunal illustrates the fundamental change in the role of the court as an industrial relations agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears the investigation by the court, as provided for in section 3, is to include investigation of pay and conditions of the employees of a particular employer.  Under other provisions of the Bill the court may make an employment regulation order setting minimum pay and other working conditions for the employer who has been the subject of an investigation by the Labour Court.  The implication is that in setting the pay and conditions the court, as part of its investigation, would summon other employers as witnesses to establish a comparator for the minimum pay and conditions to be included in any subsequent <Col N="481" /> employment regulation order.  The direct involvement of other employers in a legal process relating to the pay and conditions of a particular employer who is in an industrial relations dispute is a vista I would prefer to avoid contemplating. Suffice to say that this is not the road to maintaining positive industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The sum total of the conversion proposed would fundamentally alter the ethos as well as the institutions and would generate an employer search for loopholes and encourage litigation in industrial relations.</P>

      <P>It would increase confrontation rather than co-operation between management and employees, damage the perception of Ireland as a location for mobile international investment and, most fundamentally, threaten the voluntary social partnership which has served this country well since 1987.</P>
      <P>Another area of confusion relates to the definitions in section 13 of the representivity of a trade union for the purposes of the Bill which are, at best, uncertain and vague and, at worst, seriously flawed.  How would the Labour Court, or a court of law, interpret representative of &ldquo;a substantial number of the employees concerned having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When one adds the proposed qualification &ldquo;whether or not it represents all or a majority of the employees&rdquo;, there is little doubt that employers and even trade unions would have difficulties interpreting the provisions in this section.  My conclusion is that section 13 adds to the high degree of legal uncertainty in the Bill and legal uncertainty leads to litigation.  Litigation arising from section 13 may not be confined to challenges in the courts involving the employer and the Labour Court but may also involve a trade union and the court, and possibly all three.</P>
      <P>This Bill may be novel in an Irish industrial relations context but it is not new in itself in that it appears to represent a hotch-potch of trade union recognition legislation in other jurisdictions, including the UK and the USA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed the Deputy has come up with only a hotch-potch of various legislation given that he has been working on it for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trade Union Act, 1975, in the UK did not in practice support the development of the trade union movement nor did it advance trade union recognition.  Rather the Act occasioned a series of actions in the courts which did not benefit the trade union movement.  The Wagner legislation in the US appears to encourage confrontation, particularly in the taking of ballots.  Also, there <Col N="482" /> is little evidence that the density of trade union membership in the US increased as a result of the Act.</P>
    <P>Difficulties about trade union recognition are not new.  Under successive national agreements efforts have been made by ICTU and IBEC to devise solutions within the voluntarist industrial relations system.  The position of all Governments through the years has been that the question of whether a company recognises a trade union must be worked out between both sides and that no changes should be made to industrial relations and trade union legislation in the absence of agreement on such changes between ICTU and IBEC.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Broughan's interruptions. When the Labour Party was in Government it was lobbied on trade union recognition by the trade union movement but, in those days of political prudence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Labour Party recognised that the system which depends on willing players deciding to negotiate and to settle differences in their own good time works and that mandatory systems would destroy it.  Although Deputy Quinn, who was Minister for Enterprise and Employment at that time, knew of the trade unions' views on recognition, he did not seek to introduce such a measure because he knew it would not work.  He knew it would destroy the good work of the Labour Court and that it would change the Labour Court from an accessible mediation agency into another stamping ground for senior counsel and barristers, into an expensive litigious place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will illustrate Deputy Quinn's views at that time by drawing the House's attention to a reply given by him as Minister for Enterprise and Employment in June 1994 to a question from Deputy Gilmore on workers' representation. Deputy Broughan will not like this, it is not very tasty.  As reported in the Official Report, 29 June 1994, Vol.  444, No. 6, col.  1275 he stated:</P>
      <P>The question of whether or not an organisation recognises a trade union is something which must be worked out between both sides of industry in accordance with the voluntarist nature of our free collective bargaining system. There is no legislation enabling or disabling recognition.  In the absence of agreement between the social partners I have no proposals to legislate in this area.</P>
      <P>Those were the words of wisdom of the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Quinn.</P>

I consider trade unionists to be more mature and reflective people than does Deputy Broughan.  They will realise that this proposal is not realistic and should be described as opportunistic. Whatever short-term appeal this proposal may appear to have, the long-term consequences are to damage the very machinery that has brought us industrial peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The trade union movement in Ireland is strong. Trade union density here compares well to other European or US levels.  There is a concern because some newer businesses establishing in Ireland will not deal with unions but this Bill is an inappropriate response to that problem.  That matter has to be pursued in a cool and considered way and not in the heat generated by the latest hard case.  This is truly an instance of a hard case giving rise to a proposal for very bad law.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000 it was agreed that our industrial relations system should be modernised, among other reasons, to develop a high trust environment between employees and managers. In that context it was agreed that proposals for dispute resolution in relation to the issue of trade union recognition would be examined by a high level group on trade union recognition.  This is how I propose to proceed.</P>

      <P>In 1894 when the first meeting of the Irish Trade Unions Council met in Capel Street, Dublin, the 119 delegates in attendance represented 21,000 trade union members, directly, and 39,000, indirectly, through the various trade unions councils in Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick and Drogheda.  Nowadays over 50 per cent of the workforce is represented by trade unions.  Almost 100 per cent of those working in the public service have trade union representation. The adjectives used in 1894 to describe the address of the President, Tom O'Connell, to that first meeting were cautious, reformist and moderate. He warned against the unnecessary use of the strike and cautioned against the unilateral position of an eight hour day.  He even called for the demise of the House of Lords.  It is interesting that 104 years later that debate is still going on and in the past few weeks we again heard calls for the demise of the House of Lords.</P>
      <P>The emphasis in that inaugural year was on striking a note of respectability.  Professor Patrick Lynch in his Thomas Davis lecture of the overview on history of the trade union movement speaks about the trade union in the UK and Ireland going through three stages &mdash; oppression, tolerance and privilege.  Irish men and women trade union members have gone through all three stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early years of this century men such as James Connolly, Jim Larkin and William O'Brien had varying views.  If all three were in the House the exchange which took place between Deputy Broughan and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, would be in the ha'penny place compared to the differences those men had about how the trade union movement should expand and grow.  They were all sceptical about political parties and saw the need to keep the trade union movement independent. However, in 1922 congress contested the <Col N="485" /> election and 17 of the 18 Labour candidates were elected.</P>
    <P>Words, such as &ldquo;respectability, responsibility and restraint&rdquo; describe the aims of the trade union movement in the 1920s.  The membership fluctuated and did not thrive in the first decade of our independence. In 1923 the membership was 189,000 but by 1929 it had dropped to 92,000.  In 1939 there was a rapid recovery of the trade union movement and by 1959 when the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, was founded trade union unity had been restored and trade unions began to take their place here in a more vibrant way.</P>
    <P>The membership in 1994 &mdash; the latest year for which I could get information &mdash; was 677,560 of which 473,600 were in the Republic and 203,950 in the North.  That breaks down as 63 per cent men and 37 per cent women.</P>
    <P>The relationship between governments and trade unions has been chequered.  In the 1960s the movement played a decisive and progressive part in the great economic and social changes which took place.  The involvement of the trade union movement in the Ken Whitaker economic plans was vital to their introduction and trade unions began to take part in the formation of social policy. By 1994, the centenary of congress, suppression, toleration and position of privilege had all been experienced by the trade union movement. The position of privilege has been arrived at.  I do not say that in any pejorative way.  Trade unions are an integral part of the establishment, they are social partners.  Trade union leaders are perceived as supporters of social stability.</P>
    <P>Patrick Lynch also referred to the ghost of James Larkin smiling ironically in the photograph that appeared in a morning newspaper in February 1994 with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and Peter Cassells as President of ICTU in Dublin Castle for the centenary celebrations. This was the epitome of privilege and the unmistakable outcome of a victory fought so hard by many people through the years.  It was ironic that that centenary was celebrated in Dublin Castle given that many trade unionists in the early years of this century had fought against the control of Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The late 1970s and early 1980s were bad years for industrial relations.  We had many strikes and many issues of confrontation between trade unions, management and governments.  Since 1987 we have all enjoyed the benefits of social partnership as manifested in the Programme for National Recovery in 1987, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in 1990, the Programme for Competitiveness and Work in 1993 and Partnership 2000.  The issue of confrontation has been replaced by consensus.  These agreements have created a unique model of social partnership. They are the hallmark of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>Our EU partners and the Scandinavian countries in particular are anxious to know how we managed to secure industrial peace and reach the stage where the number of man days lost has <Col N="486" /> been reduced dramatically.  In the period l977-81, 673,000 man days were lost in one year; this figure had been reduced to 61,000 by l993.  I understand a Norwegian delegation is to visit the ICTU shortly to examine how the concept of social partnership, from which we have benefited greatly, has been developed since l987.  It was the harbinger of the Celtic tiger.  It has allowed all issues of concern for employers and, more importantly, employees to be realistically examined.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1.2 of Partnership 2000 reiterates the objectives which have underpinned the agreements. It states:</P>
    <P>The key objectives of the strategy are the continued development of an efficient, modern economy capable of high and sustainable economic and employment growth and operating within the constraints of international competitiveness ensuring that Irish society becomes more inclusive, that long-term unemployment is substantially reduced and that the benefits of growth are more equally distributed.  The strategy provides a framework within which specific issues and programmes will be developed in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Partnership involves a shared and mutual understanding of the key mechanisms and relationships in the formulation and, more importantly, implementation of policy.  There is interdependence between the partners.  What is good for one is good for another.  The Government can only supply much needed services from the taxes raised from the workforce.  Workers' future depends on good management and marketing skills and managements' prosperity depends on a happy, united and diligent workforce.  No party to the partnership can achieve its goals without the support and commitment of the others.</P>
    <P>Under Partnership 2000 it was agreed that a high level group would be established by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I understand it is chaired by Mr. Dermot McCarthy with representatives from IBEC, the ICTU and relevant Departments and it will report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It has studied the issue of trade union recognition and in an interim report presented at Christmas there was agreement that the ideal way forward was through a voluntary code accepted by workers and management.  The ICTU, however, argued for a mechanism to deal with a reluctant management which could ignore the wishes of a majority of workers.  The decision that the high level group should meet again was taken before the Ryanair dispute began.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has always supported the concept of a voluntary code.  With the Labour Party and Democratic Left, it was involved in the formulation and framing of Partnership 2000.  We agreed fully that there was a need to establish a high level group to tease out all the issues surrounding trade union recognition.  As the Minister of State reminded the House, I said during the debate on aviation policy, in which I dealt with the Ryanair <Col N="487" /> dispute, that words such as &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; are not consistent with good industrial relations.  We must remain attractive as a location for direct foreign investment.  If we are not careful, words such as &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; will damage our image abroad.  The reason the partnership agreements dating from l987 have worked is that these words have not been used.  The Government, employers and workers mutually decided to omit the concepts that had caused so much damage and so many people to take to the streets in the late l970s and early l980s.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Broughan for the work he has put into this legislation.  While the Minister of State was wrong to criticise a member of the Opposition in such a virulent way in dealing with a policy matter which requires examination, this is not the way to tackle the problem.  The legislation is untimely.  Fine Gael believes that we should await the outcome of the deliberations of the high level working group which is considering the issue of what one should do with a management that decides it will not listen to the views of workers.  We should not allow the Ryanair dispute to colour our views.</P>
    <P>I condemn the regressive and backward attitude of Ryanair management which is not willing to go to the Labour Court.  The company has benefited from the partnership agreements and Government policy over the years.  Mr. O'Leary should realise that it is placing the partnership concept in danger by refusing to participate in the Labour Court.  Will the Minister of State consider my suggestion that an independent third party should be appointed under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, l990, to tell Ryanair that it must participate?</P>
    <P>I have taken soundings on this Bill from employers and trade union members, particularly those who have long experience of negotiations. Concern has been expressed about unilaterally abandoning the concept of voluntarism and partnership which has worked so well, although others may have said to Deputy Broughan that they are very happy with the Bill which is stronger and more penal than ICTU was looking for.  It does not define, for example, the term &ldquo;a substantial number&rdquo;.  I am concerned about section 8(2) which seems to be offensive to the Labour Court.  It implies that it may make mistakes which may have to be corrected.  Will Deputy Broughan explain why this section has been included?</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom trade union recognition is not mandatory.  The Blair Government has promised a White Paper on the issue.  It recognises that there is no quick remedy.  One of the issues that is outstanding in discussions with the information section of the TUC is what constitutes a majority.  Under this Bill a majority would not be required.  Section 13 states:</P>
    <P>In determining whether a trade union is representative of employees or a category thereof <Col N="488" /> for the purposes of this or any other enactment, the trade union shall be held to be representative if it represents a substantial number of the employees concerned having regard to all the circumstances, whether or not it represents all or a majority of such employees.</P>
    <P>That is a recipe for confusion in deciding whether a trade union should be recognised.</P>
    <P>I understand the CBI and the TUC in the UK have issued a paper having studied the matter. When the high level group reports I believe there will be a case for further co-operation and discussion in a wider public arena on the issue of trade union recognition.  Bringing in legislation such as this immediately is not the way forward. Deputy Broughan's objectives are fair and he does not want a situation like that in Ryanair to be allowed to happen again, but there are other ways to do that.</P>
    <P>Ryanair cannot be allowed damage the partnership from which they have rightly gained.  The Ryanair dispute is colouring this debate and it is unfortunate that we cannot discuss the issue of trade union recognition at a time when there is no ongoing dispute about trade union recognition. This issue is particularly relevant because of the forthcoming by-election in Dublin North where many Ryanair workers live.  I fully support the Ryanair workers in their demands that management listen to their point of view in the Labour Court and allow judgment be made by the Labour Court with all the parties sitting at the table.  When the high level group reports it may well recommend a mechanism whereby errant management can be given some sanction for not agreeing to discuss matters with their employees, but we will have time to examine that issue again when the committee has reported.</P>
    <P>Great concern about this issue has been expressed by IBEC.  I cannot give facts and figures about jobs that might be lost in the future if mandatory trade union recognition legislation is introduced, but suffice to say that the people working in the many new jobs that have been created here do not have, nor are they seeking, mandatory recognition of trade unions.  Thankfully, many of those workers are enjoying the fruits of very good jobs and they can seek good pay and conditions from management because proper management-worker relations have been established in those companies.</P>
    <P>It is a fallacy to imply that mandatory recognition will be good for workers and a punishment for employers.  Mandatory recognition might also be damaging to workers.  What about the companies where workers do not want to have recognition? There is a risk that under Deputy Broughan's legislation a small number of people, who may be seen to represent a substantial number of people in a small section of a company, might be in a position to demand mandatory recognition against the wishes of many other workers.  We should not revert from the consensus to the adversarial model which did not do this country any good.  We must guard, with all our policy <Col N="489" /> ideas, the whole concept of partnership which has worked well here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan has raised an important issue which we must discuss in this House but his legislation is premature and there are elements of it which would not be good if they were put into law.  I ask the Deputy to wait until the high level group reports to see what mechanism it might recommend.  I have spoken to ICTU and employer representatives and they discussed this issue in great detail at their high level group. Clear agreement was reached that a voluntary code was the way to proceed.  I await with interest what they will say following their next meetings.</P>
    <P>I hope that any words of difference I might have with Deputy Broughan will not be taken as an indication that Fine Gael is not anxious to solve the problem where employers will not listen to their employees and treat them properly.  We fully support the Ryanair workers' case but in this instance we await the outcome of the high level group and then we will see what other studies need to be carried out before taking this step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Owen for sharing her time.  I agree fully with what has been already stated.  I am opposed to any arrangement that would impose mandatory union recognition on an employer.  One reason for this is that it would be difficult for Ireland to remain attractive as a location for foreign direct investment.  The high level group to which Deputy Owen referred, which included a number of trade unions as well as Mr. Jimmy Somers, President of SIPTU, concluded that, in light of all the circumstances, including arrangements in other jurisdictions, our voluntary approach to industrial relations should be underpinned.</P>
      <P>The Ryanair dispute has arisen at a bad time in that the emergence of one difficulty would not justify moving from the voluntary approach to this issue.  While welcoming the enormous contribution made by trade unions and workers to the economy over the years, it is important that the current national partnership be continued.</P>
      <P>The biggest investment any employer makes is in their employees.  The GLC rates are effective in ensuring that proper rates are paid to employees.  Small companies throughout the country have developed successfully due to the option of voluntary trade union recognition.  We should not walk away from that because successful companies depend on the good partnership between the employee and the employer.  The unions have done enormous work over the years ensuring that employers adhered to the code of conduct that is necessary to carry on a successful business.  Employers taking on staff are very conscious of the obligations imposed on them in regard to their employees.  That area should be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of the social partnership has been based largely on the long tradition of free collective bargaining in the industrial relations area.  It is in the context of free collective bargaining <Col N="490" /> that progress on trade union recognition will be made.  I am a business person employing a number of people and my success in dealing with my staff is due to discussing their needs with them.  Many small firms throughout the country do not avail of unions but the staff have the option of inviting them in.</P>

The biggest investment any employer makes is in personnel.  Most businesses, whether they are factories or in the retail sector, involve dealing with customers.  Unions are doing very necessary work, and I salute that, but our success to date has been based on the voluntary option. Ireland is recognised throughout the world as an attractive country in which to invest and we should not do anything to damage that recognition.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not present because it is a matter for the Minister to change Government policy in this area.  I hope the Minister of State will convey my message to him. There is insufficient money for sewerage schemes and treatment plants, which now go hand in hand. One cannot simply pump sewage into rivers or the sea.  There is a dire need for a significant amount of money to be provided annually for sewerage schemes and treatment plants for small towns and villages such as Cheekpoint.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly tabled parliamentary questions on this subject in relation to Cheekpoint to which I have got the same reply, that only a few million pounds are provided annually in this regard for the whole country.  That means hundreds of villages are waiting for the provision of sewerage schemes and treatment plants.  That type of facility should be provided and there should be a reasonable chance of it being provided within a reasonable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 30 years people from Cheekpoint have requested that a sewerage scheme be provided for the village.  All types of resolutions have been passed at county council meetings, consultants have submitted reports and as long ago as <Col N="491" /> 1981 a preliminary report was submitted to the Department of the Environment for approval.  On 2 July 1985 contract documents were submitted to the Department of the Environment.  In 1988 approval of the contract documents was received from the Department along with a direction that tenders should not be invited until specific approval to do so was given by the Department.</P>
    <P>Cheekpoint is a beautiful village at the confluence of the three sister rivers, the Barrow, the Nore and the Suir.  The development of the village and the surrounding area is inhibited due to the lack of a sewerage scheme and treatment plant.  That is a disgrace because it is a beautiful area that is ripe for development.  There are two general septic tanks for council schemes and private individuals, but other than those the people are depending on individual septic tanks. It is not desirable to have septic tanks in such a scenic area which attracts many visitors, especially in the summer months.  There are also two high class restaurants in the area.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give me and the people of Cheekpoint some hope that a sewerage scheme and a treatment plant will be provided to enable orderly development of the village and its surrounding areas so that houses can be built.  It is not fair that applicants are refused planning permission because the area does not have a sewerage scheme and a treatment plant.  Another problem is soakage in the area is not good.  Therefore, the area is dependent on the provision of a scheme.  Eventually the population will steadily grow older and the area will stagnate.  Schools may be in danger of closing due to lack of numbers. It is not possible to plan ahead if the necessary facilities are not in place for proper development. I ask the Minister to give some hope that a scheme will be provided for the village within a reasonable period and I would appreciate if he would indicate a timescale for its commencement.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter.  I would like to outline the broader picture in relation to investment in water and sewerage services before I deal with the specific issue he raised.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Water and Sewerage Services Capital Work Programme, details of which were published on 2 February last, is by far the largest in the history of the State.  Under the programme, investment in water and sewerage services will amount to almost £185 million in the current year.  That represents an increase of just over 13 per cent on expenditure during 1997 and a 50 per cent increase on the 1996 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of that is for small towns and villages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Funding at such an unprecedented level clearly demonstrates the Government's <Col N="492" /> commitment to improving the country's environmental infrastructure and to meeting the existing and projected needs arising from residential, economic and other development.  The investment programme for 1998 will see some 61 major public schemes starting construction with a final estimated value of over £470 million.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to state that County Waterford is benefiting from this substantial level of investment.  The programme covers schemes in Waterford with a final value amounting to £53.87 million.  They include interceptor sewers 3 and 4 of the Waterford main drainage scheme, the east Waterford water supply scheme and the Waterford city water conservation project, all currently at construction.  Provision has also been made for the advancement through planning of the Tramore and Dungarvan sewerage schemes as well as the treatment works and interceptor sewer 1 of the Waterford main drainage scheme.  In those circumstances it can be fairly said that Waterford city and county are getting their fair share of the available funding.  Those major schemes will greatly contribute towards removing existing development constraints in Waterford and will provide the necessary infrastructure to support tourism and other economic sectors.</P>
      <P>Turning to the specific proposal raised by Deputy Deasy, I can inform him that contract documents for stage one of the Cheekpoint sewerage scheme have been submitted to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the 1998 national water services investment programme to which I referred shows the very high level of existing commitments which have to be funded and in view of the large number of unapproved schemes countrywide before the Department it is not possible to say when this proposal will be approved.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I thank the Chair for selecting this matter for the Adjournment.  The flashpoint which led to the highlighting of the chaos that is Mountjoy Jail was the graphic condemnation by the prison chaplain last week of the gross overcrowding there.  The stark reality is that a much more serious flashpoint is looming unless the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform takes action immediately.  Where there are 250 people, many of whom are in prison for serious crimes involving violence and personal injury, drug addicts whose temperaments are dictated by their habits and their access or lack of access to drugs and a hoard of people who feel hostile or threatened, there is the chemistry for a possible catastrophe.  Given the present situation it is a miracle lives have not been lost.  The Minister should have seen this coming.  Is there not something seriously wrong with a prison system which has 200 more prison officers than prisoners, <Col N="493" /> costs the taxpayer a conservative £46,000 per prisoner per annum, where each prison space costs £110,000 to construct and has a failure rate of three out of four, or more than 70 per cent?</P>
      <P>Mountjoy Jail was built in 1850 and, despite cosmetic treatment, it is antiquated and totally inadequate.  Its modern day capacity is 500 inmates, yet on 22 July 1997 there were 684 prisoners in the jail, while on 23 October 1997 there were 687.  Last week there were 750 &mdash; that is 250 more prisoners than Mountjoy's accommodation provides for.  They are sleeping on mattresses in corridors, in dining halls and in recreation areas.</P>
      <P>Last July the prison visiting committee wrote to the Minister about the situation, but nothing seems to have happened.  The reality is that, apart from a medical unit, not a single additional prison space was provided by the Minister's party in Government between 1987 and 1994.</P>
      <P>The building programme initiated by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, ensured that in 1996 some 30 places were completed at St. Patrick's Institution, 25 at Castlerea and 68 at the Curragh. In 1997, 55 more places were completed in Limerick prison and a further 125 places will come on stream in Castlerea shortly.</P>
      <P>The new women's prison, with 60 more places, will be completed this year.  Construction is well under way for 400 spaces at Wheatfield and plans are well advanced for 80 further spaces at Portlaoise jail.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been singularly inept in dealing with this problem.  Last week he told the Dáil that 6,300 people were arrested and detained for the non-payment of fines.  Each of those 6,300 was brought with all due ceremony to Mountjoy jail before either being released or redirected elsewhere. What a waste of time, money and prison space.</P>
      <P>Every day people are jailed for the non-payment of civil debts, yet a simple Bill, which would deduct fines or civil debt liabilities from income at source &mdash; which, we were told, was supposed to be a Government priority &mdash; has been allowed to languish on the &ldquo;also ran&rdquo; list of Government measures intended for legislation.  The Minister may say that only ten spaces per day are taken up by such cases, but the reality is that last week he said 6,300 people went through the doors of Mountjoy in 1997 for the non-payment of fines.</P>
      <P>Is it not nonsensical that everybody who is sentenced by the courts is sent first to Mountjoy instead of being sent to whichever prison has the least accommodation problems?  Why not change this policy and introduce some liaison between the courts and the prison service to relieve, at least in the short-term, some of the chaos?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, presides over a prison policy that seems to have no focus or purpose except that of detention.  Is he aware that a study of Mountjoy prisoners, commissioned by his Department and published in June 1997, showed that 77 per cent of those surveyed had spent time in St. Patrick's Institution and that they had an average of 14 convictions and ten separate prison sentences each?  Their <Col N="494" /> time in prison had neither deterred nor rehabilitated them, yet community-based sanctions &mdash; according to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the NESC, and the Whitaker report &mdash; result in a far lower reoffending rate than prison.  In spite of this, the probation and welfare service remains the Cinderella of the system.</P>
    <P>Having completed the programme of 840 extra spaces, introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Owen, why is the current Minister now going to provide 2,000 more spaces at a minimum cost of £200 million plus a proven cost of £46,000 per annum to run and maintain each prison space?  As soon as the 840 spaces are available, the Minister should begin a systematic dismantling and rebuilding of the entire Mountjoy complex as well as a serious re-evaluation of current prison policy, which simply is not working.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for selecting this item for discussion and I thank the Minister for coming to respond.</P>
      <P>Our system of criminal justice has suffered from chronic neglect over a long period.  This history of inaction and lethargy has necessitated serious reform in the recent past.  No political party in this House can wash its hands of responsibility for the past neglect of our criminal justice system.  However, one party, Fianna Fáil, has been in charge of the Department of Justice of seven and a half of the past ten years.  That stark fact cannot be ignored despite the valiant efforts of our current Minister to do so while he was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>We need a rational debate on our criminal justice system and it serves nobody's interest to turn the issue into a political football.  I wish the current Minister had acknowledged this fact while he ranted and raved in Opposition.  I am more interested, however, in the actions the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform now proposes to take to tackle the issues, rather than the way he behaved while Opposition spokesman.</P>
      <P>The recent revelations regarding chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy jail demonstrate that reform of our prison system will not produce results overnight.  The current level of prison building, sanctioned and begun by the previous Government, continues apace and will provide more accommodation for prisoners.  In particular, it will provide separate accommodation for remand prisoners which has been long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government sanctioned the provision of over 800 extra prison places.  These places are necessary if we are to achieve three goals: first, that sentenced prisoners serve their sentences in full or until they are deemed fit for early release; second, that the need for the current system of renewable temporary release be removed.  This method of temporary release, the so-called revolving door syndrome, is a disgrace. It makes a mockery of the work of the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison system itself. It flies in the face of the principles of prison <Col N="495" /> rehabilitation by releasing prisoners to make more room for recently sentenced prisoners, not because they are deemed fit for release, but because new prisoners have to be accommodated. The system of temporary release has a devastating effect on victims of crime who see perpetrators of often violent crimes against them or their families being released after serving only a fraction of their sentences.  It undermines public confidence in our justice system and cannot continue. Third, increased prison spaces are needed to resolve the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy that has plagued our prison system for years.  We need extra places so that sentenced and remand prisoners can be held in standards that fulfil our international obligations and our sense of decency.</P>
    <P>Prison building, however, is only a part of the solution to our current problems.  It is time we seriously examined alternatives to incarceration. Community service orders and probation orders have always been the poor relation of the criminal justice system.  This represents a wasted opportunity.  We have an extremely high level of imprisonment and recidivism, compared to our EU neighbours.  In addition, an extremely high proportion of persons in jail are under 21.  A visit to Mountjoy is a pathetic experience, when one sees such young people incarcerated there.</P>
    <P>Many people argue that our prison system does not work and that it is not effective in preventing crime, in rehabilitating offenders or in protecting the public.  These three aspects of our current system point to an urgent need to research and properly fund a comprehensive system of alternatives to prison.  These alternatives must not be seen or portrayed as a soft option; they must be applied to individuals who show remorse for their crimes and express an intention to reform themselves in a credible manner.</P>
    <P>Given the strong links between opiate addiction and crime it is imperative that prisoners are offered a proper drug rehabilitation programme. This new departure for our criminal justice system will require significant investment in the probation and welfare services, which have been starved of funds for many years.  However, given the high cost of keeping prisoners in jail and the failure to rehabilitate the vast majority of them, it is imperative that the Minister should seriously address this issue.</P>
    <P>We have been faced with a crisis in our criminal justice system for years.  We should recognise that this presents us with both challenges and opportunities.  We should have the courage to meet these challenges and opportunities with imagination.  I hope the Minister will do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with not a little wry amusement to the contributions made in relation this matter.  It is, of course, true that due to a combination of factors &mdash; not least, the implementation of the zero tolerance policy &mdash; that the <Col N="496" /> number of prisoners in Mountjoy last week hit an all time high of 762.  Let it be said, however, that these warnings were delivered by me on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party from the Opposition benches on numerous occasions.  The day it was ensured that Mountjoy would have an all time high of 762 prisoners was the day when the rainbow coalition Government decided to cancel the building of the new prison at Castlerea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To speak in the House this evening of a prison building policy propagated by the rainbow coalition Government is to engage in a battle for a victory in fantasy land.  For the first time in recent history there is a prison building policy which is being delivered upon.  The cheque for the building of prison spaces under the rainbow coalition Government was forever in the post.</P>
      <P>I have already acknowledged that the existing level of prison accommodation is inadequate to meet current demands and that this has been the case for some years now.  I accept that this lack of accommodation is causing problems for the conditions and regimes in places of detention for prisoners.  I will come back to this later as l would like to set the record straight on a number of matters which have given rise to comment in recent days.</P>
      <P>Our prisons, particularly Mountjoy, are not overcrowded because of fine defaulters.  Last Tuesday, for example, seven persons were held overnight in Mountjoy for non-payment of fines. At no stage in recent years, let alone days or months, were 106 persons incarcerated in Mountjoy in any given day because of non-payment of fines.  I emphatically reject any such suggestions which remind me of the extraordinary day when the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, stated that there were people in prisons who should not be there and that if they were released, room would be made available for a considerable number of new prisoners.</P>
      <P>It is being suggested that the immediate introduction of an attachment of earnings Bill would in some way provide a quick fix solution to the accommodation problem in Mountjoy.  I will introduce an attachment of earnings Bill in due course as part of my overall programme of law reform.  However, to suggest that such legislation would address the situation at Mountjoy, in circumstances where only a handful of people are there for non-payment of fines and, at any given time, only 1 per cent of prisoners are in custody in the entire prison system for non-payment of fines, is wide of the mark.  It is as wide of the mark as it is to suggest that a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in office for eight months could produce hundreds of prison places overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mountjoy has been operating in excess of its capacity for many years.  I said that in Opposition <Col N="497" /> and in Government so there has been no lack of consistency in recognising the problem and seeking to resolve it.  Last week the number of prisoners reached an all time high of 762. Officers of my Department together with the Governor and staff of Mountjoy are making extraordinary efforts on a daily basis to keep the numbers in the prison at as low a level as possible in the current circumstances.  This is accomplished by transferring inmates to other prison institutions and, unfortunately, by resorting to an undesirable level of early releases.  It is clear, having regard to the established trends in the numbers of committals from the courts to prison, that the prison capacity increase being provided for by the previous Government was inadequate to fully cater for current and future demands.</P>
    <P>The current prison building programme will provide over 1,000 additional places within the first two years of this Government.  I am committed to the provision of a total of 2,000 additional places over the life of this Government in the face of Fine Gael opposition to the measure.</P>

      <P>While a significant amount of these improvement works, including the installation of integral sanitation facilities in some old prisons, and more essential health, safety and security works have been completed, much remains to be done.  Since many of our existing prisons were constructed in the 1800s &mdash; some of them are 150 to 200 years old &mdash; Members will appreciate the urgent need for proceeding with modernisation and improvement works, particularly in the older institutions.  It is unacceptable that some prisoners are held in overcrowded conditions but this problem is being addressed as a matter of urgency.  The various refurbishment works and the extensive building programme will come on stream in the coming months and years to help resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the development of community sanctions and measures as alternatives to custody and as a means of combating crime.  My Department's probation and welfare service has a significant role to play in this regard. A number of alternatives to custody are already in place.  On average, on a daily basis, there are well over 4,000 offenders serving community-based sanctions under the supervision of the probation and welfare service.  That is almost twice the number of persons who are in custody. Approximately 1,042 offenders are placed on probation orders each year.  Another alternative to custody which has proven successful is community service.  Each year approximately 1,600 offenders are required by the courts to perform community service.</P>
      <P>A more recent development in the area of alternatives to imprisonment is intensive probation supervision.  This is a special community based programme for serious or persistent offenders requiring a more intensive form of supervision.  Participants may be referred to this scheme by courts as an alternative to a substantial sentence &mdash; two years or more &mdash; or may be released early from custody towards the end of such a sentence. They are obliged to attend and take an active part in the programme as a strict condition of their continuing to reside in the community.  Failure to do so means an immediate return to court or to custody.  The scheme commenced in 1992 and now has over 150 offenders participating in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my Department's policy to develop probation as a viable alternative to imprisonment.  To this end, funding is provided to over 40 hostels, day centres and workshops.  These projects are operated by a number of voluntary, community and business groups in association with the Probation and Welfare Service, and they are working to intervene with young people at risk of offending and to reduce re-offending among those already involved in criminal behaviour and under supervision.  The financial assistance available to these bodies in 1997 was over £4 million.  Prevention is a key strategy in the fight against crime. By funding community based facilities and harnessing <Col N="500" /> community goodwill to reduce offending behaviour, particularly in disadvantaged areas, the Probation and Welfare Service can, even with relatively small amounts of money, produce significant results.</P>
    <P>I again stress my commitment to community sanctions and measures as viable alternatives to custody.  I recently established a group to examine the Probation and Welfare Service, its role, needs and organisational structure, and to make recommendations on how the service should develop into the next millennium.  In this context, I secured funding for a much needed new IT system for the service which will be developed in 1998.  I also secured additional money for three new probation centres for 1998.  In total, I increased funding to the Probation and Welfare Service in 1998 by 27 per cent over last year's allocation.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined will, in time, alleviate the problem of overcrowding in prisons and places of detention.  Unfortunately, many offenders at this time are under 21 years of age, and in response to this, the new Children Bill contains important proposals for the more appropriate management of young offenders to steer them away from a life of crime.</P>
    <P>I trust I have now illustrated that this Government is well on the way to ending, once and for all, the discredited system of the revolving door in the Irish criminal justice system.</P>

      <P>I believe the primary duty of the State is to protect the safety of its people, and this is as true in the classroom as anywhere else.

The teachers have concluded they can no longer provide schooling to the pupil at the centre of this incident.  However, the Minister insists the school cannot expel the pupil unless and until it finds another school willing to take him.  It is unacceptable the Minister allows such a stand-off. He cannot wash his hands of responsibilities in this area.  The State exercises its authority to compel school attendance and it must be willing to provide suitable accommodation and not to seek <Col N="501" /> to shunt responsibility onto a school which cannot cope in such an instance.</P>
    <P>Parents and pupils also have fundamental rights which must be respected.  We are in the process of enshrining new rights for parents and students to appeal the exercise of authority by a teacher or a school.  The Minister must go further in this area.  An education Ombudsman must be appointed.  Parents must be embraced as an equal partner.  Coherent policies governing behaviour and suspensions which parents can see are applied consistently are needed in schools.  All rights carry reciprocal duties and a serious issue which arises in this case is whether compulsory attendance should extend to parents to attend child case conferences, or to pupils to attend psychological assessments.  I believe there should be such compulsion on pupils and parents in respect of the education of their children, which is itself compulsory.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have been far too quick to act as Pontius Pilate in the issue of school discipline.  The Department has guidelines which it issues to schools, but this is a matter of resourcing schools to cope.  Disruptive children cannot be dealt with unless a resourced alternative exists to cater for them.  Children are not being cared for in the right way.  Schools do not have available to them the alternative treatments needed for particularly disruptive children.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had for well over a year a path breaking report on school discipline.  It put forward a serious and logical proposal: the establishment of a support team to which a teacher or a school could refer, at a timely stage, a child with discipline problems.  No such support team is available to schools at present.  Such a team should involve psychologists and counsellors as well as education specialists and community gardaí.  Not only was this recommended one year ago in the report on school discipline, the same recommendation resurfaced when the Clondalkin study on school attendance arose.</P>
    <P>The system of education, welfare and school attendance is a shambles.  No coherent records are kept of school attendance; they have fallen into disuse.  School attendance officers, or education welfare officers as they are known in modern parlance, are only in a handful of areas.  No consistent policies are set out in this area.  Suspensions are not consistently reported to anyone and problem children are left to be catered for by the school, predominantly acting alone.  This is a huge gap which must be filled.  It is impossible to expect teachers, who sometimes must teach up to 40 pupils in a primary classroom, to deal with extremely disruptive children.</P>
    <P>It is high time this issue was addressed and that the curriculum was examined to see if it is properly equipped to cater for children who have difficulties responding to the traditional curriculum and school environment.  It is gone beyond the stage now where the old type curriculum is used for all pupils regardless.  Curricula should be more flexible and project based to encourage particularly <Col N="502" /> disruptive young people who get frustrated in the existing system to develop their talents. Teachers must be supported in the classroom with proper resources.  I hope the Minister will now commit those resources and devise structures to involve those in the health and justice services in such a support team for schools.</P>

      <P>We are all deeply shocked by the assault on the teacher.  On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Martin, myself and our Department, I take this opportunity to wish him a quick and complete recovery from the injuries he received.  I sincerely hope he will soon be able to resume teaching.</P>
      <P>Nobody can legislate for this type of incident. While a certain level of security must be maintained at every school, boards of management cannot be expected to take extreme measures to guard against every possible scenario.  School should be a happy place where our children can be educated in an atmosphere that is free from fear and tension, and I have every confidence in the wisdom of school authorities to decide what is appropriate for each school.</P>
      <P>The Department has issued guidelines to assist schools in discharging their responsibilities in the area of discipline.  These were drawn up following consultation with representatives of management, teachers and parents.  The managerial authorities are responsible for ensuring that there is a fair and efficient code of behaviour in their school, and these guidelines are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to meet the particular requirements of the school.  A copy of the Report on Discipline in Schools which was commissioned by the Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin has been made available to every school.  This report sets out models of best practice, and I am confident that it will be a valuable resource for school authorities in helping them to deal with breaches of discipline.</P>
      <P>Dr. Martin's report comprehensively addresses issues such as the extent to which discipline is a problem in schools, and sets out models of good practice in the maintenance of discipline in schools.  The report outlines the views of teachers on innovative strategies to promote and maintain a good standard of discipline.  While the report found that the vast majority of schools consider that discipline has become more of an issue in recent years, 80 per cent of the schools surveyed described the level of indiscipline as low.</P>
      <P>The report also states that the new programmes at second level, such as transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme, are having a positive impact on students and help to reduce breaches of discipline.  The introduction of the junior certificate school programme will assist further in matching the abilities, aptitudes and interests of each student which, in turn, will positively influence their behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> We are currently finalising proposals for the establishment of a management support service. This will help school authorities to deal with vital areas such as school planning and discipline.  We intend to put this service in place for the new school year in consultation with the partners in education.  Teachers and school authorities throughout the country deal competently and sensitively with a wide range of breaches of discipline on a daily basis.  Parents and guardians who are familiar with the school code of discipline readily accept that sanctions are needed from time to time.</P>
    <P>Incidents such as the recent assault on a teacher, which are thankfully extremely rare, raise issues of security as well as discipline.  I am greatly reassured by the manner in which this very serious situation is being handled by the school authorities.  Their prompt and responsible action demonstrates, if proof were needed, that the guidelines currently in place, as set out in the Department's circular which was issued last September, are sufficiently adaptable to address even the most difficult situations.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we accept that there cannot be any complacency in this area, and we intend to keep the whole issue of school discipline under continuous review.  It is always unwise to place too much emphasis on extreme, isolated incidents <Col N="504" /> when formulating future policy, and we must not overlook the fact that the overwhelming majority of our pupils are conscientious and well behaved. Likewise, the vast majority of parents fully support the school in its efforts to create a spirit of mutual respect and co-operation.  Ultimately, it is the school authority which is best placed to assess the local situation, and we have no immediate plans to change guidelines which have been drawn up in consultation with the partners in education, and which are sufficiently flexible to enable school authorities to adapt them to meet their particular needs.</P>
    <P>I assure the House the Minister for Education and Science is deeply interested in this matter. With the officials in our Department, we are addressing it in great detail.  We will be bringing forward our report shortly on what we propose to do in this area.  It is important that the House should realise that we must all be responsible, that we must all maintain a resolute respect for a code of discipline right across society.  That initially starts at home, continues through the school system and ultimately in society.  Collectively, we have a duty to ensure that the proper environment exists so that the school system can serve our nation and that discipline is maintained not alone in the education system but in later life.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some of the conditions attached to the tourism angling measures administered by the Central Fisheries Board are preventing clubs from applying for development funding in the fear that their members' access will be severely curtailed or restricted.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism provides over £16 million for the development of the tourism angling product to ensure that our coarse game and sea angling resources are upgraded to the best international standards.  Two of the key criteria for funding are that applicants must demonstrate that the project will be capable of attracting additional foreign visitors leading to increased employment and tourist revenue and be readily available for tourist use.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the programme has a key target of increasing the number of tourist anglers from 179,000 to 240,000 over the period of the programme.</P>
      <P>The overriding objective, therefore, of the programme is the improvement of our angling resource so as to attract more tourist anglers to Ireland and thereby to create additional economic activity and jobs in the sector.  An essential condition for receipt of EU grant aid is that tourist anglers will be guaranteed equal opportunity of access to any fishery which is upgraded with the assistance of that funding.  Letters of offer to successful applicants contain an explicit reference to this requirement as a pre-condition for any project being funded under the measure.</P>
      <P>Any angling club, community group or private concern as well as the Regional Fisheries Boards may apply for funding under the programme.  To date some 90 projects have been approved for EU funding of over £12 million.  If approved for funding it is a matter for applicants to decide whether they are prepared to meet the conditions of the aid including that of equal opportunity of access for tourist anglers.  In the final analysis this is a tourism angling initiative and clearly EU moneys may not be provided for developments of angling facilities to which tourist anglers are denied access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been encouraged by the increasing number of clubs and community groups putting forward projects under the programme.  I would like to see more such projects coming forward in line with my objective of closely involving local interests in fisheries development.  I am strongly of the view that far from being reluctant to participate, angling clubs all over the country should be working hard to access funding through soundly based projects which will enable them to <Col N="506" /> upgrade and develop their own local fishery to the benefit of tourist and local anglers alike.</P>

      <P>The fleet renewal and modernisation measure under the fisheries operational programme is administered by BIM in accordance with fully objective procedures laid down by the Department and agreed by the EU Commission and the Operational Programme Monitoring Committee.  These are subject to audit and crosschecks by the Department and Commission inspectors, as well as BIM itself.</P>
      <P>Applications are rigorously assessed by BIM to ensure compliance with eligibility criteria which are set out in the relevant EU Regulations. Applications are scrutinised by BIM to ensure that they represent value for money.  To inform this assessment process, a database of costs for previous modernisation projects is maintained against which quotations for new applications are compared.  Quotations for major modernisation works are further cross checked against information from suppliers.</P>
      <P>BIM's own technical and administrative staff have considerable expertise in assessing quotations for works.  All projects are subject to financial approval of the fleet investment committee within BIM and in some instances the approval of the board itself, prior to submission to the Department and me for final approval.</P>
      <P>All projects are subject to strict assessment from a technical and structural perspective. Refurbishment projects which entail alterations to the structure of a vessel are assessed to ensure adherence to safety and stability standards. Boatyards are visited by BIM's survey staff during and on completion of the project in order to ensure that work has been carried out in accordance with technical specification and best marine engineering practice.  On completion of the project a full inspection of the work is carried out by BIM technical staff and a clearance report is provided before grant funds are released.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the systems currently in place in BIM are designed to ensure that the projects are validated from the necessary technical perspectives and represent good value for money.  Those systems will continue to be kept under review and regularly crosschecked by BIM to ensure that the relevant standards and criteria are met.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a written question on 28 January last, the work of the task force on the dumping of radioactive materials in the maritime area is at an advanced stage and I expect its report to be published in March. Deputies will recall that I established the task force last year in the wake of revelations by the UK authorities that documents had been discovered in the public record office in London which indicated that radioactive waste had been dumped in Beaufort's Dyke in the north Irish Sea during the 1950s.

      <P>EU funding for the fishing fleet under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99 has not to date been allocated to new vessel purchases but has been directed exclusively towards the modernisation of existing vessels.  Accordingly no EU funding could have been provided, or commitments given in relation to the likelihood of such funding, in the case of the applicant in question.  The position was clarified to the applicant by BIM in 1996 and was further clarified to him by the Department by letter on two occasions last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my announcement last week of proposals for funding a capital grant aid scheme for a number of new vessels over the next three years.  These proposals will be submitted to the EU Commission in the coming weeks.  However, I believe that it is only right for me to confirm that this scheme will not, for obvious reasons, have retrospective application.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 39 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Significant co-ordinated investment in ports infrastructure and shipping servicing the central Irish Sea corridor has been completed in recent years or is under way and nearing completion. The development of Dublin Bay port's facilities catering for ro-ro and lo-lo traffic has attracted new and improved services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997 Dublin Port and Dún Laoghaire Harbour were vested as commercial semi-State companies under the Harbours Act, 1996.  The effect of this is that the new Dublin Port Company and Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company will both be able to operate as commercial enterprises, free from undue control by the State to manage and develop services on a commercial basis.</P>
      <P>The ongoing investment programme for Dublin and Dún Laoghaire of some £60 million funded by the port companies and port customers and co-financed, through my Department, by the EU from the Operational Programme for Transport, the Cohesion Fund and Ireland/Wales Maritime INTERREG Community Initiative will continue until end 1999.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Bay ports are being provided with the infrastructure and flexibility to operate efficiently, effectively and ultimately benefit trade, tourism and the economy as a whole.  The central Irish Sea corridor can now boast state of the art ro-ro facilities including upgraded marshalling acreage, new passenger facilities serviced by northern Europe's largest multipurpose ferry and the world's largest high speed ferry with new ro-ro vessels due to come on service later this year along with upgraded cranes and rail link to service lo-lo services from Dublin Port to Liverpool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of these operations in attracting additional freight traffic is demonstrated by <Col N="510" /> record throughput statistics for the central corridor which show a 128 per cent increase in ro-ro freight carried in 1996 compared to 1993.  Passenger numbers recorded a 16 per cent growth for the same period.  I am confident that the success story of the central Irish Sea corridor can be continued and cater for projected future growth.</P>

      <P>There is a growing awareness of the commercial potential of lobster fishing for inshore fishermen around the coast.  My Department together with BIM is working in close consultation with the lobster fishing industry to ensure that effective stock conservation, management and development strategies are put in place and that the necessary support is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Active encouragement, and financial support through the EU PESCA Initiative and the Leader Programme, has been given to locally generated stock preservation and enhancement programmes. Statutory controls on lobster fishing have been introduced to underpin these voluntary initiatives.  Specifically, the sale of lobsters below a specified minimum size has been banned, and lobsters which are &ldquo;V notched&rdquo; must be returned to the sea for breeding purposes.  The &ldquo;V notch&rdquo; programme is proving to be successful and paying dividends in terms of stock enhancement.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been made by certain sections of the lobster fishing industry that statutory controls, in the form of specific lobster fishing licences, should be introduced as a further protection and incentive.  While I fully support the underlying objective there are complex legal and practical implications inherent in this approach. These are being assessed by my Department in consultation with the Office of Attorney General and BIM and there will be detailed ongoing discussions with the lobster fishermen with a view to working out an agreed and achievable framework within which the industry can go forward.</P>

Only last month the Department published a further safety booklet, on man overboard procedures for fishing vessels, copies of which are currently being made available to skippers.  I can also report that guidelines on emergency procedures for fishing vessels are currently being developed and it is proposed to shortly publish these for distribution to the fishing industry.  This range of safety information booklets can play a very useful role in developing a safety culture among fishermen, which the review group identified as being necessary.</P>

These proposals include a plan for a capital grant aid scheme for new whitefish vessels. I have also secured in the Finance Bill special tax based reliefs to encourage capital into the whitefish fleet.  These proposals which are designed to be consistent with State aid parameters will be submitted to the EU Commission in the coming weeks.  I am confident that the proposed reliefs and capital grant programme will enable the industry to set about the challenge of renewal with the aim of securing the safety, competitiveness and long-term future of the fleet.</P>

      <P>EU and Exchequer funding of £79 million is supporting a total investment programme of over £141 million for the fishing industry under the Fisheries Operational Programme 1994-99.  The funding is supporting targeted investment in the sector in order to maintain and enhance its contribution to the national economy and in particular its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities.  This is being achieved through specific investment programmes for fleet modernisation, fishery harbour development, fish processing, marketing, training and research.  Almost £40 million of the total EU aid of £63 million available under the Operational Programme has been committed to projects to date.</P>
      <P>Funding is also available under the PESCA Community Initiative to assist fishing communities to diversify and to support alternative economic activity including aquaculture, marine tourism and stock management.  The amount of EU aid remaining to be allocated under the PESCA Community Initiative is approximately £2.7 million. There has been, therefore, a significant take up by the fishing sector of available EU and Exchequer funding to date.  My objective is to ensure efficient and effective use of remaining funding up to 1999, to deliver on investment objectives for the sector.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I announced last August an action plan on pollution prevention and response strategies at both national and regional level to tackle fish kill incidents and damage to water quality as it affects fish stocks and freshwater fish habitats.  The action plan is designed to ensure that the resources of the fisheries service and of all relevant agencies are deployed and mobilised to best effect to prevent pollution, deal with the causes of pollution and to act swiftly when pollution occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I subsequently expanded on this initiative on 1 September when I endorsed a national fisheries catchment management strategy by giving the immediate go-ahead to six pilot fisheries catchment projects around the country.  Under the pilot scheme local fisheries, tourism angling industry and farming interests are working together to plan catchment development strategies to improve water quality, prevent pollution and protect fish life.  I had the opportunity last Saturday of assessing progress at first hand on the pilot project for the Barrow Catchment which confirms my view that local co-operation, <Col N="516" /> empowerment and involvement is the way forward in tackling the many challenges facing the fisheries resource.</P>
    <P>A key component of my water quality action plan was to address as quickly as possible the need for better farm practice to minimise the risk of agricultural pollution to fish stocks and habitats. I am pleased to report that the response of the farming organisations has been positive, constructive and responsible and that the IFA together with Teagasc launched a programme designed to guide and inform farmers on the need and scope for reduction in phosphate usage which will have consequent beneficial effects for water quality.  I have requested the Central Fisheries Board for a detailed progress report on all aspects of implementation of the water quality action plan which I announced last August.  I will advise the Deputy of the fully up to date position as soon as the Central Fisheries Board reports.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that in reaching a decision on licences in relation to aquaculture developments in Woodstown strand, the legitimate interests of all users of the area will be given due consideration.  To this end a consultation process was initiated by the Department to seek the views of interested parties.</P>
      <P>The objective of the consultation process was to arrive at a consensus on the sharing of responsibility for the rational development of aquaculture both in terms of oyster production and bottom mussel cultivation in the Waterford estuary.  A meeting was held with local fishermen and it was agreed that groups comprised of all interested parties should be set up to agree a way forward.  The Department also engaged in correspondence with solicitors acting on behalf of certain local fishermen with a view to establishing the nature and extent of their fishing activity including details of records of catch and the value thereof, in the case of fishermen deriving a substantial part of their earnings from fishing, details of tax returns and for those claiming social welfare entitlements, notification of earnings to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requested information has not been furnished to date.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the absence of verifiable information on these issues it is not possible to deduce the likely economic impact on the activities of local fishermen which might result from the existing and proposed aquaculture developments in the estuary. In this regard I should also point out that the <Col N="517" /> Department was informed by the solicitors that legal action was being initiated on behalf of the local fishermen against the owners of oyster cages at West Bank at Woodstown and the Department.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above, it is my wish that a consensus should be reached with existing users of the estuary.  The licensing process requires careful scrutiny of proposals taking into account the views and interests of all the parties and these procedures will be rigorously followed.  My intention is that existing applications for aquaculture licences will be dealt with under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1997, which provides a comprehensive and independent appeals process in respect of any licensing decision.</P>

      <P>My Department is responsible for administering the CSF operational programme for fisheries, 1994-99, which provides for EU aid of over £62 million.  The programme is aimed towards supporting targeted investment in order to maintain and enhance the commercial fishery sector's contribution to the national economy and in particular its contribution to growth and employment in coastal communities.</P>
      <P>There are nine measures within the programme. The measures are administered by the appropriate Departments or implementing agencies, not all of which are under the aegis of my Department.  Four of the measures specifically involve grant-aid schemes for the private sector and a fifth, the research measure, provides funding for a range of projects across the spectrum of marine endeavour from fisheries and marine food to marine technology.  The projects are practical and innovative and are characterised by strong partnership between business, third-level institutions and the public sector.</P>
      <P>The CSF mid-term review package agreed that implementing Departments would examine the scope for implementing changes in pursuit of achieving the CSF evaluator's recommendations in regard to cost recovery and the need for more competition in the delivery of services.  These provisions are intended to cover mainstream services and activities such as training and marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> The terms of the package were presented to the members of the fisheries operational programme monitoring committee at its last meeting on 22 October, 1997.  BIM is the body responsible for the delivery of the training and marketing measures of the operational programme.  My Department is examining options with them in order to report to the next monitoring committee meeting on 22 April, 1998.</P>
    <P>The technical assistance measure of the programme is administered by my Department.  It is designed to underpin all other measures by assisting with economic, technical and feasibility studies and support services.  Public procurement rules are applied to contracts placed under the measure.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department is responsible for the following measures: first the forestry sub-programme of the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry (OPARDF): Funds currently allocated to the forestry sub-programme of the OPARDF under the community support framework are approximately £74.146 million in 1996 prices over the six year period 1994 to 1999.  In July, 1997 an evaluation of the forestry human resources measure of the forestry sub-programme, which attracts approximately 12 per cent of sub-programme funds, recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that a proportion of courses be put out to tender to seek the involvement of the private sector, the third level institutions and other bodies.</P>
    <P>My Department subsequently set up a liaison group to review the training and education needs of the forestry sector in the light of that evaluation. Further steps will await the outcome of the group's deliberations which are due to commence on 3 March 1998.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that grants under the OPARDF relate mainly to farmers and, to a lesser extent, to individuals, companies or institutions. Grant beneficiaries, private and public, while obviously not required to participate in a tendering process in the normally accepted sense of that term are awarded grants on the basis of compliance with eligibility criteria set down for the various schemes and a competitive assessment and selection process.</P>
    <P>Second is the commercial seaports and regional ports measures of the Operational Programme for transport.  The commercial seaports and regional ports measures provide for an investment of over £60 million, attracting EU aid of over £30 million, in port infrastructure over the six year period 1994 to 1999.  The availability of EU aid acts as a strong lever for investments in ports generating up to 55 per cent matching funding and has also managed to involve the private sector in a significant role in port development. My Department has actively encouraged investment proposals from the private sector.  These projects represent a total investment of £16 million including a private sector contribution of approximately £9 million.  Projects, both public <Col N="520" /> and private, approved for aid under these measures are subject to EU procurement procedures.</P>
    <P>Third, the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism, the central and regional fisheries boards are in receipts of funds &mdash; £12.2 million approved to date &mdash; under the tourism angling measure of the operational programme for tourism.  Grant aid is available under the measure to the public and the private sectors and the relevant eligibility criteria apply equally to all applicants.</P>
    <P>Fourth is the coast protection measure of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services. This measure provides for expenditure of £5.1 million over the six year period, 1994-99. Under the measure, aid is primarily available for the protection of public property and infrastructure. Private property will only be considered if it can be shown that some unique fauna, flora, etc. is being protected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been known for a number of years that gold mineralisation has existed in the Clontibret area of County Monaghan and over the years there has been considerable interest in exploring the deposits to ascertain if the deposits can be considered commercial.  The current holder of prospecting licences permitting exploration for gold and certain other minerals in the area is Conroy Diamonds and Gold Plc.  The first three licences which were issued to this company allowing prospecting in the area were issued in July 1996 with two further licences issuing in November 1996.  The company had promising results from its initial exploration and sought additional areas.  A further licence issued in April 1997.  Four other licences issued in January 1998 and applications for six others are currently being processed. All licences are valid for a period of six years.</P>
      <P>While the company issued a press release on 22 January 1998 in regard to the prospects of the mineralisation eventually being proven to be commercial, much further detailed work needs to be done to support the view that an economic deposit is present.  Technical staff of my Department are regularly monitoring the exploration activities of the licensee and are being kept fully informed of developments.  A State mining lease or licence authorising the commercial extraction of gold has not been sought in respect of any of the licence areas and it would be far too early for me to consider an application at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="522" /> Before consideration could be given to the issue of a lease or licence authorising extraction the application would have to be made to my Department supported by a feasibility study and my Department would have to consider the economic viability of a mine and appropriate terms for the State mining lease or licence.  The company would also have to seek and obtain planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency before a mining facility would issue.  Only then could mine development commence.  These latter processes would require that the company carry out a detailed environmental impact study.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the evidence since the 1970s of a slow decline in sea trout stocks in a number of catchments and of the population collapse in many mid-western sea trout fisheries in 1989.  Sea trout research programmes have pointed to a range of environmental factors which are adversely affecting sea trout habitats and other fish stocks, including drainage, pollution, fertilisation, predation, hillside erosion and acidification. In addition to these factors the 1994 Whitaker report, associated the marked incidence of adverse pressure on mid-western sea trout stocks with heavy sea lice infestations on prematurely returning post smolt sea trout.</P>
      <P>National sea trout conservation management and research programmes since 1991 have been directed towards the necessary sea trout research and stock rehabilitation, through stock assessment, restocking and conservation measures as well as measures to address the various adverse factors at work.  The measures include intensive sea lice management strategies on marine based salmon farms.  Further enhancement of these multiple strategies was recommended in the Whitaker Sea Trout Task Force Report of 1994 which has been the agreed blue print for sea trout programmes since that time.  There is evidence that the strategies have been paying dividends with modest improvements in a number of stocks. However, the reliability of rod catch statistics and sea trout stock assessments, through notably the installation of counters, needs to be further improved, in order to accurately quantify the impact of measures taken to date and to underpin ongoing management and rehabilitation strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My policy objective is to secure the future of sea trout stocks through forward looking sea trout rehabilitation management, conservation and research strategies which are consistent with <Col N="523" /> the overall approach laid down by the Whitaker task force in 1994 while drawing on the collective experience of the last four years.  The Marine Institute, the Salmon Research Agency and Central Fisheries Board have been asked to review that experience and to make proposals on how best to take forward the science, management and structures for dialogue in relation to the sea trout programmes.  The collective view of the agencies will directly inform my thinking on future directions for sea trout strategies.  Those strategies will continue to reflect the widespread consensus that the sea trout question is far from being one dimensional but involves a variety of multifaceted and complex factors.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy is referring to oil and gas exploration and development in our continental shelf.  There is now a substantial interest in our offshore with a near all time high number of authorisations on issue to petroleum exploration and seismic acquisition and other data companies.  At present there are in place 28 petroleum exploration licences; 17 petroleum prospecting licences; petroleum licensing options and one petroleum lease and an application for another petroleum lease is under consideration by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1997 three exploration wells were drilled, two in the Porcupine Basin and one in the Kish Bank Basin, and hydrocarbon shows were encountered in one of the Porcupine wells.  In addition two appraisal wells were drilled in the Connemara Oilfield, but the field was not declared commercial. Also, last year 25,000 line kilometres of <Col N="524" /> seismic was acquired and that was a record for seismic acquisition in Ireland.  Plans for seismic companies for 1998 indicate that it also will be a good year for seismic acquisition.  I expect that two wells will be drilled this year &mdash; one exploration and one appraisal well.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to be precise in regard to the potential for a new commercial development in our offshore as it would depend on specific aspects of the field such as, the amount of oil or gas recoverable, the duration of production, the distance to land, water depth at the location, costs and market price of the product.  My concerns in relation to any future oil or gas development in our offshore would be to ensure that there is optimum recovery of the oil or gas, that it is done in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner and that the development should make the maximum possible contribution to the economy.</P>

      <P>The taking of shellfish and crustaceans by divers has been prohibited by law in this country since 1965.  There were a number of reasons the prohibition was introduced.  Principally, there was widespread concern amongst traditional fishermen around the coast at the effect which divers were having on stocks especially in relation to scallops and crayfish.</P>
      <P>The levels of catch by divers severely depleted stocks and threatened the economic survival of inshore fishermen.  Stocks were also threatened by the fact that diving for crayfish and scallops was at its highest during the summer months when the fishery was closed to traditional fishermen for conservation purposes.  In addition, the diving method provided very little employment and usually yielded nothing to the local coastal community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> In recent years there has been a remarkable increase in the number of diving centres around the coast.  This has attracted large numbers of tourists from the UK and the Continent and it is in this direction and as a leisure activity that diving within our coastal waters should be encouraged to develop.</P>

      <Col N="528" /> The most recent population and labour force projections report was prepared by the CSO in 1994 and published in 1995, using the census and labour force information then available.  This included labour force projections up to the year 2006.  Because of the uncertainties of the assumptions which would be involved, the labour force projections were not divided into their employment and unemployment components.  An updated set of projections is being prepared by the CSO for publication towards the end of 1998.</P>

      <P>A 1798 commemoration lecture tour of America will take place over a seven day period in late March of this year.  Professor Tom Bartlett of UCD and Professor Kevin Whelan of Notre Dame University, Dublin will participate in all five of the lectures planned.  It is also intended that papers will be given by academics from each of the host universities.</P>
      <P>The first of these lectures will take place in New York University, New York, on 25 March followed by lectures in Georgetown University, Washington, on 26 March, Boston College, Boston, on 28 March, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, on 29 March, and, finally, Notre Dame University, South Bend, Indiana, on 30 March.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the lectures, while not overly academic, will deal with the history of 1798 from a national and international perspective, will look at the culture and memory of this period and in addition will examine this aspect of Irish history from an American perspective.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that a lecture tour of Australia will take place in September of this year, with lectures taking place in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Hobart in Tasmania.  Professor Tom Bartlett and Dr. Ruan O'Donnell, an expert on Irish-Australian history, have both agreed to participate in the tour.  However, plans are at an early stage and a final schedule is not yet in place.</P>

      <QRef>[4004/98]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, on 28 January. The NESC report No. 102 on population distribution and economic development provides a very thought-provoking analysis of population distribution patterns in Ireland and an assessment of consequent policy implications.  The report finds, <i>inter alia,</i> that counties Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim and Cavan remain on the margins of the urbanisation process and, as a result, endure relative disadvantage in economic development. Consequently, the NESC recommends special area based measures for these counties which would take due account of local conditions and resources in policy development and implementation.</P>
      <P>As a first step, I have referred the report to relevant Ministers and Departments for their deliberation.  I should point out, at the same time, that a number of innovative initiatives are already under way to assist the disadvantaged counties in question, for example, Interreg rural resettlement and local development programmes.  These initiatives are complemented in the cases of counties Cavan and Leitrim by other measures operating under the auspices of the International Fund for Ireland and the EU Peace and Reconciliation Fund.  All these proactive programmes represent serious attempts to alleviate and perhaps eventually redress the relative disadvantage suffered by the counties in question.  The NESC report No. 102 is particularly timely, having regard to the preparation at present of a White Paper on rural development.  That paper will be used in the next round of the CAP negotiations and will take into account not just agriculture, but rural development in its broadest sense, including from the perspectives of education, industry and infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is acutely conscious of the special needs of all disadvantaged areas.  With particular regard to County Cavan, we accept fully the importance of the link between infrastructure on the one hand and inward investment and job creation on the other.  As a further indication of the Government's firm intentions in that regard, I draw the Deputy's attention to the recent announcement by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in which over IR£7.5 million will be allocated in 1998 for the restoration and improvement of non-national roads in County Cavan.  This, together with an estimated IR£1.35 million being inputted by the council from its own resources, means that about IR£9 million will be expended on these roads in County Cavan this <Col N="531" /> year.  In addition, the National Roads Authority has allocated IR£9.74 million for the improvement and maintenance of national roads in the county during 1998.</P>

      <P>Since the closure of Pretty Polly Limited in 1995, IDA Ireland has been actively promoting the town as a priority area.  The site and buildings were offered free of charge to IDA Ireland by Sara Lee Corporation, the parent company of Pretty Polly, with the objective of attracting a new manufacturing company to the site.</P>
      <P>A new brochure to promote the building was launched in January 1996, together with a new Killarney town brochure.  Both of these brochures were designed by Pretty Polly and IDA Ireland, and were funded by Sara Lee Corporation.  The new brochures were used for intensive marketing of the Pretty Polly site, particularly in the United States.  Initially, companies in the textiles sector were targeted, then the marketing campaign was broadened to include other sectors such as electronics and engineering.</P>
      <P>From July 1995 to date, there have been 24 IDA Ireland sponsored site visits to Killarney and 22 of these visited the Pretty Polly site.  IDA Ireland continues to prioritise and highlight the Pretty Polly site to all potential industrialists visiting the area.</P>

      <P>The multilateral agreement on investment, known as the MAI, is being negotiated under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the OECD, in Paris.  It will be a free standing international treaty open to all countries willing and able to meet its obligations. Negotiations are due to be completed this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Countries which become party to the MAI will commit themselves to treat foreign investors no less favourably than they treat their own investors. They will also agree not to discriminate among investors of different MAI parties.  Other <Col N="532" /> important provisions will include the following: transparency of laws and regulations; the right to transfer funds to and from the host country, although governments will be able to suspend this right temporarily in the event of a balance of payments or monetary crisis; the right of the investor to bring key personnel to the host country, subject to general immigration laws; the prohibition of certain performance requirements such as minimum export targets, as a condition for allowing an investment to be set up; and the right of a foreign investor to adequate and effective compensation in the event of the expropriation of property.</P>
    <P>All these provisions will be underpinned by a dispute resolution system, both between states and between the investor and the host state. Where countries are willing and able to implement the main thrust of the MAI but have difficulties with specific obligations, they will have the opportunity to negotiate country-specific exceptions.</P>
    <P>The Government supports the conclusion of the MAI and expects that this country will, in due course, become a party to it.  This would allow us to give yet another important signal to foreign investors that they are welcome here.  We already treat foreign investors favourably and would not, therefore, need to make fundamental changes in order to honour our commitments.</P>
    <P>The agreement would also be of value to our outward investors in that it would allow them to compete on a level playing field in the markets of those countries which choose to become party to the MAI.  They would also benefit from the assurance that they can repatriate their profits here, employ Irish managers and specialised technicians and have a right of fair and adequate compensation if their property in another MAI country were ever expropriated.</P>
    <P>I am aware that criticisms of this proposed agreement have been voiced by some development agencies because of concerns that it would have a negative effect on developing countries. While all OECD countries are expected to sign the agreement, there is no similar expectation in the case of non-OECD countries.  All countries willing and able to meet the obligations of the MAI will be welcome to sign the agreement, but no-one will be obliged to do so.  If a particular country decided to sign the MAI, it would increase its attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment.  However, it would be for every country to decide for itself whether the balance of advantage lay in signing the agreement.</P>

      <P>A receiver was appointed some weeks ago to Squash Ireland Limited, in receivership, on foot of a debenture held by Lower Mount Limited.  The Registrar of Companies advises me that despite reports to the contrary, a portion of a charge due to the debenture holder remains unsatisfied.  Subsequent to the receiver's appointment, a creditor presented a petition to the High Court for the winding-up of the company.  The High Court has yet to make an order on that petition.</P>
      <P>The Companies Acts provide particular duties to a liquidator.  Among those is the duty to inquire into the reasons for a company's failure and to report the results to the High Court for such action as the court deems fit.  Section 142 of the 1990 Act is relevant in this regard.  In view of the fact that the matter is before the High Court and that the appointment of a liquidator would enable the matters in question to be fully investigated, I do not propose to exercise my powers of investigation under Part II of the Companies Act, 1990.</P>

      <P>It is too early in the year to report specific progress in job creation for any part of the country in 1998.</P>
      <P>However, in 1997, in the west region, IDA Ireland created 1,428 new jobs, a growth of 9.5 per cent from the 944 new jobs created in 1996. There were also nine project announcements for the west region during 1997.  The impact of these announcements will result in additional employment in the area during 1998 and in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of the agency to attract overseas investment to the north-west region, the results are disappointing.  In the case of IDA Ireland assisted companies, 279 jobs were created in 1997 compared to 297 jobs in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA Ireland continues to pursue a policy of encouraging and facilitating the most equitable regional distribution of jobs throughout the country. The result of this proactive approach was reflected in 1997 in several project announcements for areas outside the larger urban centres. IDA Ireland is committed to attracting more <Col N="534" /> investment to all regions and I assure the Deputy that both the west and north-west areas will continue to be extensively promoted during 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main factors giving rise to the decision to withdraw from the provision of export credit insurance was that the State scheme was tiny in the context of our total exports.  Over the six year period since the scheme was restructured, the total turnover, or contract value, of exports covered was about £66 million.  This compares to a total value of merchandise exports in 1997 alone of over £30 billion.  The number of companies which availed of the scheme was less than 20.</P>
      <P>The scale of operation of the restructured scheme, when compared to our buoyant exports, shows it has been of minimal benefit to exporters. I am satisfied that the scheme is no longer necessary and that its abolition will not have any significant adverse effect on industry.</P>

      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment issued 633 dual use export licences and 434 military export licences during 1997.  Of the 434 military licences, 363 were granted to private individuals for the purposes of exporting shotguns.</P>
      <P>Of the total number of export licences granted during 1997, seven dual use licences were granted for the export of dual use goods to Columbia.  The Department is unable to disclose the names of licensed exporters and end users as all dealings with individual applicants for export licences, which can involve the disclosure of commercially sensitive information, are conducted on the basis that confidentiality will be maintained.</P>
      <P>When examining export licence applications, the Department takes account of several factors such as the description of the goods, end use and the end user of the goods, the reputation of the company and information made available arising from Ireland's participation in EU and other international export control regimes.  On the basis of the assessments carried out, the Department was satisfied that the goods authorised for export to Columbia were not intended for use in the violation of human rights.</P>

Information for 1998 is not as yet available.  The information sought in respect of the individual towns named by the Deputy is not available.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is committed to securing new projects for the north-west region, particularly County Donegal, and every effort is being made to ensure that this happens during 1998.  IDA Ireland has put in place a number of specific measures for the Donegal area including financial incentives which are biased in favour of regional locations such as Donegal; working in partnership with the local authorities in the region to provide high quality sites.  An example of this is in Letterkenny, where IDA Ireland is developing a 27 acre business park in conjunction with Donegal County Council.  Serviced sites are also available in Donegal, Ballyshannon and Buncrana; a new 20,000 sq.  ft.  advance factory building to be constructed in Letterkenny as soon as planning permission has been received; Letterkenny being promoted for international service projects due to the availability of graduates from Letterkenny Regional Technical College with appropriate skills and the allocation of two senior managers to work with the north-west/Donegal regional office in attracting small German companies to the area.</P>
      <P>Forbairt for its part is actively engaged in seeking industrial and other employment for County Donegal and is involved in a number of initiatives in this regard including: working with Donegal County Council in examining means of developing both existing companies in the fish processing sector and the infrastructure in Killybegs to maintain and grow the port's strategic importance; the agency has promoted a number of seminars in Letterkenny encouraging involvement in teleworking; in November 1996 Forbairt approved assistance for a community enterprise centre in Ballyshannon; Donegal County Council has undertaken with Forbairt's help an assessment of a potential industrial estate for Killybegs; the initiative for Killybegs manufacturing industries to investigate servicing the offshore oil industry for Killybegs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> The monetary returns from the forestry programme prior to the establishement of Coillte Teoranta in 1989 were essentially derived from the sale of timber during that period.  These returns were reported annually to the Oireachtas and are available in the Appropriation Accounts for the years in question.</P>
    <P>The value of the State's forest asset transferred to Coillte Teoranta on 1 January 1989 was £575 million and the State has received share certificates in respect of that value.  I understand that between capital investment and growth within the forest estate, the current value of this asset is now in excess of £1,000 million.  As the Deputy is aware, Coillte Teoranta is a commercial private company owned by the State and the company's annual reports detail its annual financial activities.</P>

      <P>The central and regional fisheries boards have responsibility for and administer fisheries previously held by the Land Commission. Stated policy and practice is to lease, as opposed to selling, these fisheries with preference given as far as possible to local angling interests.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board also has direct responsibility for the management of the State owned Galway, Erriff and Moy fisheries. Reflecting my stated policy commitment to the catchment management approach, I generally favour devolving the management of fisheries to regional and local level and to ensuring the full participation of local angling and enterprise groups in development of the resource.</P>
      <P>Apart from the ESB, which has statutory ownership of fishing rights on the Shannon catchment, I am not aware of fishing rights held by State companies which would give rise to the concerns underlying the Deputy's question.  If the Deputy has details of a specific situation, I would be glad to have it investigated.</P>

The efficiency, effectiveness and value for money of the national and regional inland fisheries protection programmes is being evaluated currently in the context of my review of overall fisheries management and conservation strategies and of expenditure programmes and structures of the inland fisheries service.</P>

      <P>It is a key priority for the Government to maximise fishing opportunities and, therefore, incomes for the fishing industry and to ensure that all fishing vessels fishing in our waters are strictly monitored and controlled both at sea and in port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> I will continue at EU level to press other member states to co-operate more closely on and to demonstrate real commitment to fisheries control and enforcement.  I have also been pressing the Commission to expedite new proposals aimed at enhancing existing fisheries control measures.  I won agreement last October to the introduction of new EU conservation measures which are designed to protect juvenile fish stocks and spawning grounds.  In the annual negotiating round on the total allowable catches for fish stocks, my stated policy objective is to ensure increased quotas for Irish fishermen through the setting of TACs at a level which, while taking account of the conservation imperative, reflects the economic needs of fishermen.</P>
    <P>Existing and proposed EU agreements with third countries provide increasingly valuable access to fishing grounds for member states' fishing fleets.  The Irish fleet already benefits from agreements with Norway the Faroes and Greenland. Ongoing Commission proposals for new agreements are being monitored closely, in consultation with the industry, to ensure that potential benefits for the Irish fishing fleet are realised.</P>

      <P>There are two grounds on the basis of which a person resident abroad, not already an Irish citizen through birth in Ireland or the birth in Ireland of a parent, may apply for Irish citizenship &mdash; descent from a grandparent or, in certain circumstances, a great-grandparent who was born in Ireland or marriage to a person who is an Irish citizen by birth or descent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure by which persons born and resident abroad may apply for citizenship is by having particulars of their births entered in the Foreign Births Entry Book at an Irish Embassy or in the Foreign Births Register at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  A standard application form is completed and presented with copies of a current passport and two photographs of the applicant, the long form of the civil birth certificates of the applicant, his-her parent and his-her grandparent, the long form of the marriage certificates of the parent and grandparent and, if applicable, the death certificate(s) of the parent and-or grandparent and the fee of £100 or £34, if under 18. Processing the applications involves checking that the evidence of the applicant's identity and of his-her descent from a grandparent born in Ireland <Col N="545" /> are satisfactory.  This is normally done in three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>A foreign national who has been married to a person who is an Irish citizen by birth or descent for at least three years, whose marriage is subsisting and who is living with his-her Irish spouse may become and Irish citizen by making, on a special form, a declaration accepting Irish citizenship as his or her post-nuptial citizenship.  The Irish spouse makes an affidavit in a standard form confirming the facts on which the declaration of the non-Irish spouse is based.  The declaration and affidavit must be witnessed by a qualified person.</P>
    <P>If resident abroad the couple's declaration and affidavit are presented to an Irish Embassy or Consulate along with the long form of the birth certificate, the passport and three photographs of each spouse, other proofs of their identities and that they are living together.  After presentation of the documentation, the couple may be called for interview.  Due to the risk of fraud and the possibility of marriages of convenience, applications for Irish citizenship based on marriage have to be carefully checked.  This process normally takes some months.  When an application is found to be in order it is passed to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for formal acceptance.  The foreign national is so informed and asked to send the fee of £100 direct to that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made clear in my reply to Deputy Connaughton's question on the subject of Irian Jaya-West Papua of 11 December 1997, the Government is open to considering allocating further grants to meet the needs of the most vulnerable and to promote food security throughout the island in the coming months.  In this context, I assure the Deputy that I have received the recent appeal issued by the International Committee of the Red Cross for Irian Jaya-West Papua, as well as a number of other appeals for humanitarian funding for the island as a whole.  I have asked officials dealing with emergency aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs to examine these <Col N="546" /> appeals closely and recommend what actions the Government can take that will best support the needs of the population on the island of New Guinea.</P>
    <P>The Government approved a grant of £50,000 in December 1997 to support the provision of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations on the island of New Guinea.  The entire island, which is shared by Irian Jaya-West Papua and Papua New Guinea, had been severely affected by the El Nino phenomenon.  No rainfall had occurred on the island since April 1997 and UN estimates indicated that at least 500,000 throughout the island were suffering from malnutrition.</P>
    <P>This grant was channelled through the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs, UNDHA, and was equally divided between those most in need in Irian Jaya-West Papua and Papua New Guinea.  The UNDHA has been providing relief supplies, medical assistance and transport to the worst affected areas using light aircraft to distribute supplies to remote areas.  Distribution is being carried out by UN personnel on the ground and I understand that the operation, which is also financed by the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Britain and Norway, has been going well.</P>
    <P>As is usual with all emergency grants made to international organisations and to non-governmental institutions, officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs remain in close contact with the officials in the implementing institution and receive regular informal updates on the progress of the project.  I also expect to receive a full financial and narrative report following completion of the project, which is scheduled to finish at the end of April 1998.</P>

      <P>The Government wishes to see an end to the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba.  On 5 November 1997, Ireland, along with all our European Union partners, voted in the United Nations General Assembly in favour of a resolution which called for this to happen.  The General Assembly adopted the resolution with 143 votes in favour, three against and 17 abstentions.  The US Government is well aware of our concern about the embargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 2 December 1996, Ireland joined with the other EU member states to adopt a common position on Cuba.  The EU favours a peaceful transition to democracy and a sustainable recovery and improvement in living standards of the Cuban people and does not try to bring about <Col N="547" /> change by coercive measures with the effect of increasing hardship.  Nevertheless, I wish to make clear that the EU, including Ireland, attaches importance to the Cuban Government's responsibility to ensure full respect for human rights and political freedoms within Cuba.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The appalling human rights situation in Colombia is of serious concern to Ireland and our partners in the European Union.  As Amnesty International has made clear, the human rights crisis continues to worsen as the long running armed conflict intensifies.  Amnesty International has also noted that although the numbers of human rights abuses directly attributable to the armed forces has decreased in recent years, there has been an increase in the numbers of abuses committed by paramilitary and vigilante groups operating with their support or acquiescence.  The former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, met the Colombian Foreign Minister, Senora Maria Emma Mejia Velez, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 22 September 1997 and took the opportunity to express Ireland's deep concern about the situation in Colombia, the widespread abuses of human rights and attacks on human rights workers.</P>
      <P>On 25 September 1997, the Luxembourg Presidency issued on behalf of the European Union a declaration on the political and human rights situation in Colombia.  The EU reiterated its strong support for the recommendations made by the UN Commission on Human Rights in reports drawn up following visits to Colombia and urged all parties to avoid a worsening of the problem of displaced persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of reports of aerial bombardment of civilians by the armed forces and of other attacks by armed groups on defenceless civilian communities.  I assure the Deputies that Ireland will continue to encourage and support effective international action to redress the human rights abuses in Colombia.  In particular, Ireland welcomes the recommendations recently made by <Col N="548" /> Amnesty International in relation to Colombia. At the UN Commission on Human Rights meeting in Geneva, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs. Mary Robinson, will report on the operations of her office in Bogota and on the general human rights situation in Colombia. We are hopeful that the mandate for this office will be extended.</P>

      <Quest>if Iraq is developing weapons of mass destruction including biological and chemical weapons on a major scale; if this is contributing to instability in the area; and the representations, if any, Ireland has made to Iraq in this regard.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">

      <P>Ireland wants the complete removal of weapons of mass destruction from all of the Middle East as we believe that the presence of these weapons in any one country increases instability in the entire region.</P>
      <P>Following the Gulf War, the United Nations Security Council in resolution 687 of 1991 authorized the setting up of the United Nations Special Commission, UNSCOM, in order to ascertain the location of biological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction held by Iraq and to destroy these weapons.</P>
      <P>The inspection system set up by the United Nations has had some successes.  The question of Iraq's nuclear capacity was investigated by the International Atomic Energy Commission which, in its fourth report of 14 January 1998, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, stated that there was no indication that Iraq had been successful in its attempts to produce nuclear weapons, although it had been on the threshold of success in certain elements of such production. Most of the components of the Iraqi nuclear weapons programme had been revealed, destroyed or rendered harmless by the end of 1992 with some further prescribed material being handed over in August 1995.</P>
      <P>As regards chemical and biological weapons, it was reported last year that UNSCOM had succeeded in discovering and destroying an advanced chemical weapons capability.  The commission has also succeeded in destroying Iraq's production facilities for biological weapons. However there still remains, in UNSCOM's view, a quantitatively small but qualitatively still significant number of items unaccounted for in Iraq.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation is complicated by the fact that the work of UNSCOM has constantly been frustrated by non-compliance on the Iraqi side.  The latest crisis has arisen from the refusal by Iraq to co-operate with the inspection team which it claims is dominated by personnel from a small number of countries.  The dispute has now broadened to include disagreement on access to presidential <Col N="549" /> sites and on the timetable for the completion of inspections.</P>
    <P>If Iraq was to retain any weapons of mass destruction it would remain in defiance of the decisions of the UN Security Council and would continue to pose a threat to the international community.  Ireland, together with EU partners, has consistently called on Iraq to comply with the relevant UN resolutions.  Diplomatic efforts are ongoing and I remain hopeful that a peaceful outcome will be achieved.</P>

      <P>The prevention of the further spread of nuclear weapons remains a cornerstone of Irish foreign policy.  The Government is alert to the danger of the further proliferation of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems.  We remain vigilant, along with other like-minded countries, ensuring that Ireland in no way unwittingly contributes to the spread of nuclear weapons capability and, to this end, we apply strict export controls on all equipment, components and sub-components which may be used in the development of such weapons or delivery systems.</P>
      <P>India detonated a nuclear explosive device in 1975 and both India and Pakistan have been active in the acquisition of nuclear weapons capability for many years.  India and Pakistan have refused to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty, 1968.  Successive Irish Governments have called in particular on so called &ldquo;threshold states&rdquo;, that is, states with a known but undeclared nuclear weapons capability, such as India and Pakistan, to accede to the NPT.  India and Pakistan have more recently refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 1995.  Both these countries have been made aware of our concerns in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both India and Pakistan are known to be capable of, and in the process of further developing, the means to deliver nuclear weapons, including the development of missile delivery systems. While clearly both countries have acquired elements of their respective missile capability from third parties, China has denied the supply of such technology or equipment to Pakistan.  In the context of its non-proliferation commitments mentioned above, Ireland maintains strict export controls on all equipment, components or sub-components to India and Pakistan which could be used in the development of nuclear weapons and the delivery systems. <Col N="550" /></P>

      <P>I am deeply concerned about mounting tensions in Kosovo.  We continue to take every opportunity, including through recent bilateral contracts and with our EU partners, to impress on the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia FRY and the Kosovar Albanians the need for restraint and the early start of substantive dialogue to resolve the issues which are at the heart of these tensions.</P>
      <P>The EU has condemned both violent police action against peaceful demonstrators in Kosovo and terrorist acts by certain Kosovars.  The EU declaration of 9 April 1996 on recognition of the FRY by EU member states called for full respect for human and minority rights and the granting of a large degree of autonomy for Kosovo within the FRY.  This remains the Union's position as spelt out most recently in a public declaration by the Union to the citizens of the FRY.</P>
      <P>Confidence-building measures need to be set in place urgently.  The education agreement, which was brokered in 1996 by the Vatican-based St. Egidio Community, between President Milosevic and Kosovar leader, Dr. Rugova, needs to be implemented without delay to allow Kosovar students to return to their institutions.  I hope further mediation by the St. Egidio Community will achieve progress.  The EU has made clear its readiness to provide financial support urgently for any agreed solution on education and to assist with other measures for the building of a civil society in Kosovo.  The EU is ready to exercise a beneficial role through the opening of an office in Kosovo, if allowed to do so by the FRY authorities.</P>

      <P>There is no federal or state legislation in Australia prohibiting the erection of masts within 500 metres of human habitation, nor is there a national or state regulation requiring emissions to be below 0.001 microwatts per square centimetre.</P>
      <P>The current Australian standard sets a public exposure limit of 200 microwatts per square centimetre. In May 1997, the Australian Department of Human Services and Health's committee on electromagenetic energy &mdash; public health issues published an information leaflet on health issues relating to mobile telecommunications towers. That leaflet reflects the current position of the Australian authorities.</P>

      <P>The terms genetic engineering and genetically modified organisms are commonly used to describe the application of bio-technology in the agriculture and food sectors although its use is by no means confined to these sectors.  The technology has potential in terms of facilitating the production of safer and cheaper food but, obviously as with all technology, great care must be taken to ensure that its use is, at all times, regulated in such a way as to safeguard the well being of consumers and the environment.  In this connection, the European Union has introduced regulations governing the sale of novel foods, including those obtained by genetic engineering and the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment.  These regulations are being implemented respectively by the Department of Health and the Environment Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>Although my Department has overall responsibility for the development of the food industry, it is not itself engaged in research on food production methods and technologies.  Such work is carried out by Teagasc, the universities and other third level institutions and individual food companies. While my Department keeps up to date with developments in this field, it is not conducting any studies on genetic engineering of foods.  In 1997, Teagasc carried out a field trial to evaluate genetically modified sugar beet. However, Teagasc was not involved in the genetic modification of the beet.  A small amount of work being carried out at Moorepark, falling into the general area of biotechnology, could in certain circumstances be described as genetic engineering.</P>

      <P>My Department implements a wide range of programmes which include direct payments for farmers, aids for on-farm investment, structual improvement and environmental protection as well as the Leader programme and the pilot programme on the provision of integrated public services in rural areas, designed to support rural communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> The Leader programme which operates throughout rural areas in the 12 western counties provides an opportunity for local groups and communities to involve themselves directly in the development of their own areas.  In particular my Department requires each of the approved groups to implement a local programme of animanation and capacity building to facilitate and support community activity as well as grant aiding local projects.  Indicative allocations totalling almost £44 million has been approved for groups operating wholly or partly in the 12 western counties in the period to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The pilot programme for the provision of integrated public services was established with the objective of testing community based models of public service delivery in rural areas of low and dispersed populations.  The involvement of local communities in the delivery of public services has an important part to play in the revitalisation and renewal of rural communities and the experience gained from the pilot programme will make a valuable and practical contribution to policy formulation in the future.  Six of the seven pilot initiatives are based in western counties.</P>
    <P>My Department also now has responsibility for the Western Development Commission which has been established to promote economic and social development in seven of the western counties, Connaught and Counties Clare and Donegal in the interests of the people in the region.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made to establish the Commission on a statutory basis and to provide for a western investment fund to assist investment and enterprise in the region.</P>
    <P>Rural development forms an important element of the European Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals and I will be seeking to ensure that a coherent and integrated rural development policy forms part of the reform of the CAP and the next &ldquo;round&rdquo; of Structural Funds.  I announced recently details on the preparation of a White Paper on Rural Development which will address the challenge of supporting rural communities throughout the country in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Teagasc National Farm Survey shows that in 1996 the average agricultural family farm income for western farmers was £7,782.  This figure does not include off-farm earnings and the survey shows that on 41 per cent of western farms either the holder, or the holder's spouse, had an off-farm job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> I am concerned about the issue of low farm incomes in the west of Ireland.  There are of course a number of measures in place which are helping to improve the situation.  Under the Structural Funds for example, cattle and sheep headage payments in disadvantaged areas amounted to over £126 million in 1997.  Western farmers also benefit from direct payments provided for under the reform of the CAP in 1992. The Teagasc survey shows that in 1996 the average western farmer received in total almost £5,500 in such direct payments.  Measures such as the scheme of early retirement from farming and various tax concessions are also in place to encourage improvements in agricultural structures. There is a significant usage of REPS by farmers in the region.</P>
    <P>In the context of Agenda 2000 one of my main objectives will be not only to protect farm incomes but to seek to maximise the income of all farmers particularly those on smaller farms.  The Government, while recognising the importance of primary agriculture, will also be looking at the wider rural development perspective in terms of diversifying the rural economy through on-farm and off-farm enterprises and activities in order to maintain viable sustainable rural communities.</P>

      <P>Under the EU regulations governing the quota regime, farmers holding suckler cow quotas greater than seven, were required to use at least 70 per cent of that quota in 1996 otherwise the part not used would be forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  Farmers may not lease out quota for more than three successive years and may sell that quota following three years of leasing. The person named established a suckler cow quota of 19 premium rights in 1992.  He leased out his entire quota in 1994 and leased out nine premium rights in 1995 and in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was required to use at least 70 per cent of the quota in 1996 but, having leased out only nine premium rights and not having applied for suckler <Col N="563" /> cow premium scheme himself in 1996, the amount of quota used was less than the required 70 per cent.  The unused quota, i.e. ten premium rights was forfeited and returned to the national reserve.  He appealed the decision to forfeit those rights but that appeal was rejected.</P>

At an on-farm inspection on 10 December 1997 one of the animals applied upon was found to be a female and thus ineligible for this scheme.  This action was considered to be seriously negligent and consequently the applicants were informed on 19 December 1997 of their exclusion from the special beef premium scheme for 1997.  The applicants sought to have this decision reviewed and a review was carried out by a person other than the person who made the original decision.  The original decision was upheld and the applicants were informed accordingly on 5 February 1998. It is open to the applicants to have this decision appealed to the headage and premia appeals unit. Appeals should normally be lodged with the appeals unit within 21 days.  No such appeal has yet been lodged.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package (which was paid out in October 1996) provided for the payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU special beef premium scheme or 1995 suckler cow premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards or downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme and 1996 suckler cow premium scheme.  In effect, the regulations required that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme and 1996 suckler <Col N="564" /> cow premium scheme are made, a comparison was carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money was recouped from those farmers who had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The person named was paid BSE special beef premium top-up on 50 male animals amounting to £954.00 (50 × £19.08), based on the 1995 special beef premium scheme.  He had 14 less eligible male animals in 1996 and for this reason the sum of £267.12 (14 × £19.08) was recovered from his 1997 deseasonalisation slaughter premium payment.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The cattle artificial insemination service in Ireland is currently regulated by the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Act, 1947 and the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Regulations, 1948.</P>
      <P>Under this legislation a person may not distribute or sell bull semen or practice the artificial insemination of cattle under and in accordance with a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has licensed 13 semen trading companies to sell and distribute bull semen.  Eight AI organisations have been licensed to provide an AI field service and AI technicians employed by these organisations to deliver the service to farmers have been approved by my Department. Individual farmers have also been licensed to carry out artificial insemination of cattle in their own herds only.  Through this structure the artificial insemination in each case may be performed using semen from any of the licensed AI service organisations or licensed semen trading companies provided the semen satisfies all the necessary <Col N="567" /> animal health and zootechnical requirements laid down in legislation and licence conditions.</P>
    <P>Intra-Community trade in bovine semen is governed by the European Communities (Trade in Bovine Breeding Animals, their Semen, Ova and Embryos) Regulations, 1996 &mdash; SI No. 112 of 1996.  Under these Regulations any person may import semen into the State provided it is first consigned to an approved semen collection centre and it complies with all the relevant provisions of the 1996 Regulations and is accompanied by the required animal health and zootechnical certification.</P>
    <P>The system for licensing AI service organisations under the 1947 Act is currently under review in my Department.  However, in view of the veterinary and zootechnical control considerations involved, it is not intended to allow each AI technician to provide an independent semen sales and AI service.  It is envisaged that, for the foreseeable future, it will be in the best interest of the cattle breeding industry for such services to be provided by organisations with all the necessary resources to ensure an effectively controlled and comprehensive quality service.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that there will be full compliance with all the relevant national and EU legislation and AI licences and approvals issued thereunder.</P>

      <P>Under the European quality beef scheme, approximately 26 mecu will be made available by the European Union this year for the promotion of quality beef and to underpin the new EU regulation on the labelling of beef.  The main objective of the European quality beef scheme is to promote beef on a generic basis as a quality product.  The new regulation on labelling is designed to ensure the accuracy of claims made about the quality or origin of beef.</P>
      <P>Bord Bia has been recently allocated a grant of just over £1 million under this scheme for the promotion of high quality and value-added meat products in key European markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already expressed concern about the difficulties being experienced by Irish beef exporters on the European market as a result of the renationalisation of that market following the BSE scare of 1996.  I am particularly concerned about developments on the UK market and am in the process of meeting the major UK multiples to discuss the situation.  I have recently asked Bord Bia to prepare a strategy as a matter of urgency to enable Irish beef exporters to recover market share in these markets and I have also held discussions with the beef industry and with farm organisations about the funding of that strategy.  No final <Col N="569" /> decision will be made on the funding until the Bord Bia strategy has been approved.</P>

      <P>The strategic management initiative provides for major changes to the financial management system.  The central features of the new approach are a move to multi-annual budgeting and a clearer focus on the outputs or results of expenditure programmes. Departments will be given the maximum possible scope for managing the resources allocated to them.</P>
      <P>As a counterpart to the greater delegation, each expenditure programme is to be subject to a thorough review every three years.  The reviews will be carried out by the spending Departments under the aegis of steering groups drawn from the spending Department concerned and the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>In July 1997, the Government approved the first programme of spending reviews by all major Departments and Offices to be started in 1997. The Government also considered an indicative list of the reviews which might be started in the second and third years of the programme.</P>
      <P>The 1997 reviews are currently under way. They are at varying stages.  A small number have been completed, others are at an early stage.  My Department has urged that the full programme be completed by the summer.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for successfully carrying through a review lies with the Department responsible for the programme being reviewed. This reflects the responsibility and accountability that properly lies with Departments' managements.</P>
      <P>In the summer, I intend to propose to the Government the programme of reviews for the second year.  A decision on the future programme of reviews will take account of progress with the first round of reviews.</P>
      <P>The main aim at this early stage is to ensure that the review process is introduced successfully and supports reform of the financial management system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my Department, which does not have significant spending programmes under its aegis, a review of the ESRI has been carried out.  Other Ministers will no doubt supply information on reviews in their areas should the Deputy ask them. <Col N="570" /></P>

      <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners does not record details of changes in ownership which arise after cars have been licensed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for road tax purposes.

      <P>I have no functional responsibility for forecasting vehicle numbers in the longer-term.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has no statutory function in relation to the supervision of banks.  In accordance with the Central Bank Acts, the Central Bank has the duty and function of licensing and supervising banks in Ireland.  The Deputy will recall that in response to a previous question from him I indicated that the Governor of the Central Bank had confirmed to me that the board of the bank is satisfied with its legal powers; that the board keeps under review the bank's supervisory practices and its approach to supervision; that the board endeavours to ensure that these are in line with international best practice and are subject to continuous modernisation and adaptation to meet the needs of a changing global environment.  I also indicated that the Governor confirmed that the board is satisfied that the supervisory procedures and practices are effectively implemented by the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the Bank is obliged to report to the Garda a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering.  Money laundering embraces tax evasion. In addition, under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Central Bank may disclose to the Garda, where it has <Col N="573" /> reasonable cause to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence.</P>
    <P>On evasion of tax, neither the Central Bank nor my Department have a statutory role which would involve them in prosecuting any person or persons. As I said when I spoke on the motion establishing the Moriarty Tribunal in September, the pursuit of the tax affairs of individuals and companies is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister for Finance does not get involved in such cases for obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>I want to make very clear my complete intolerance of those who engage in tax evasion and of those who assist or abet tax evaders.  Revenue already have a wide range of powers to combat such evasion.  These include powers to access bank accounts although only in certain specified circumstances where they have the names of the account holders.  Following the publication of the report of the McCracken Tribunal, I asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to review the existing powers and to come back to me on this if they believe that these should be augmented.  In addition, the terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal requires the tribunal to make such recommendations as it considers expedient for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment or maintenance of offshore accounts, and to recommend whether any changes in tax laws should be made to achieve this end.  If additional powers are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective then legislative proposals will be brought forward.</P>
    <P>While the Governor is satisfied with his existing legal powers of supervision and regulation, the Deputy should note that the terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations the tribunal considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally.  Any action recommended by the tribunal on this issue will, of course, be considered.</P>

      <P>Information from income tax returns is not recorded in such a way that it would be possible to provide an estimate of the income levels of individuals liable to capital gains tax.  To obtain the information it would be necessary to identify the cases and extract the information manually.  Such an exercise could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>It has previously been stated that a 1 per cent reduction in the 40 per cent rate of CGT costs about £2 million.  Consequently, on a static basis, reducing the standard rate of CGT to 20 per cent for all relevant disposals would cost of the order of £40 million.  However, being a prudent accountant, I considered it necessary to take account of the likely increased buoyancy and the retention of the 40 per cent rate on certain disposals and, therefore, as I announced on budget day, the estimated full year cost of the reduction would be in the region of £19 million.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable the cost of the reduced rate to be apportioned between multinational and indigenous companies.</P>
      <P>The total value of assets held in family trusts is not known.  It is impossible therefore to outline the likely total gains to such trusts from the reduction to 20 per cent of the standard CGT rate.</P>

      <P>Stamp duties are payable on certain documents such as deeds of property transfer.  The rate of stamp duty on the transfer of land depends on the market value of the land.  There is an exemption from stamp duty in respect of conveyances, transfers or leases of land made to a body of persons established for charitable purposes only or to the trustees of a trust so established.  To qualify for the exemption the land must be acquired by a charity and it must be acquired for the purposes of carrying on the charity.  The exemption is confined to charities which have been approved as such by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>This exemption for charities is based on legislation and neither I nor the Revenue Commissioners have powers to waive stamp duty in other cases where an exemption does not exist. Any move to legislate for an exemption for voluntary groups in general would reduce the yield from stamp duty and, perhaps more crucially, given the diversity of groups which fall into this category it would be very difficult to administer and could not be easily confined to genuine cases.</P>
      <P>Revenue from stamp duty on property plays an important role in shifting some of the burden of taxation away from employment and it also makes a significant contribution toward the cost of implementing Government policy.</P>

Articles of children's personal footwear of sizes which do not exceed the size appropriate to children of average foot size of ten years of age, but excluding footwear which is not described, labelled, marked or marketed on the basis of age of size, are zero rated for VAT.</P>
      <P>All other clothing and footwear attracts VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.  The provisions of EU VAT law would rule out any extension in the scope of the zero rate at this stage.</P>
      <P>The practical administration of these provisions is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, who have at all times endeavoured to apply them in an equitable way and in full consultation and agreement with the clothing and footwear trade. Explanatory leaflets detailing Revenue's administrative practices in this area are available on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that some children may require adult size clothing and footwear earlier than others.  However, any rule with a cut off point, <Col N="577" /> such as this one, is likely to give rise to anomalous situations, with both winners and losers.</P>
    <P>I sympathise fully with any parents or guardians who may face additional costs arising from the rules in question.  However, I regret to say that it would not be practical to put special arrangements in place to deal with the problem as they would be costly, difficult to administer fairly and likely to give rise to an even greater number of anomalies than the current system.</P>

      <P>The Valuation Office will relocate from its existing premises at Ely Place to new premises in the Irish Life Centre, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin, in early March 1998.</P>
      <P>The Valuation Office is providing accommodation for archive storage and reading facilities at the Irish Life Centre.  This accommodation will comply with standards and conditions prescribed by the National Archives with regard to controlled atmosphere, lighting and security.  The retrieval, handling and reading of material will be regulated to accord with National Archives specifications. Material requiring temporary storage will be held in a custom built facility approved by the National Archives to meet archive storage requirements.</P>
      <P>The National Archives Act, 1986, requires that, with limited exceptions, all departmental records more than 30 years old must be transferred to the National Archives where they will be made available for inspection by the public.  Therefore, transfer of the material to local authority libraries is not possible.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the National Archives Act, only those records which are subject to a disposal authorisation issued by the National Archives are destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To allow the removal of existing records to the new accommodation, the Records Branch in the Valuation Office will close for a period and will not reopen until the end of March 1998.  An enhanced service will then be available to the public at the Irish Life Centre. <Col N="578" /></P>

      <P>The widow's pension of £6,322 which the taxpayer receives from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs together with her income from employment is taxable.  This pension, however, is paid gross by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, i.e. without tax being deducted.  The method of taxing the social welfare widow's pension is that an amount equivalent to the annual social welfare payment is deducted from the taxpayer's full tax-free allowances.  Consequently, the taxpayer's net tax-free allowance, for use against other sources of income, is £278.  I do not accept that the method of collecting income tax in this case represents a disincentive to returning to employment.</P>

      <P>The matters raised concern beer duty suspension and deferment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulation 14(1) of the Beef Regulations, 1993, requires the prior approval of the Revenue Commissioners before beer may be removed from a tax warehouse without payment of duty for a purpose other than exportation or shipment as stores.  Since the introduction of the end-product beer duty regime in 1993, the commissioners' policy has been to restrict the inter-warehouse movement of beer, both home-brewed and imported, in the State except in certain limited circumstances; for example, where the beer is intended to be exported or shipped as stores at the end of its storage period in the State, or the beer requires further processing or packaging, or where exceptional circumstances apply in a particular case.  The deferred duty payment arrangements which apply to beer &mdash; average 45 days deferment &mdash; are considered very generous given the comparatively limited shelf life of beer products generally.  The commissioners therefore will not normally allow the re-warehousing in the <Col N="580" /> State of packaged beer intended for home use where the sole intention is to extend the period of duty-suspension of the beer in question.</P>
    <P>The brewing company concerned wrote to their local warehouse control officer on 22 December 1997 with a proposal to remove bulk consignments of beer from their tax warehouse in Dublin for bottling, under duty suspension arrangements, at the premises of a third party in Wexford.  The company claimed that the Wexford premises was an approved tax warehouse but subsequently official inquiries established that this was not the case and the company was informed accordingly on 5 February last.  The brewing company was also informed at that time that if an application for approval as a tax warehouse was received from the Wexford company the application would be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>An application from the Wexford company for approval of their premises as a tax warehouse was received by fax on 10 February and approval, under the standard conditions applicable to such cases, was granted with effect from 13 February. An application from the brewing company to be allowed to remove bulk beef from their tax warehouse to the Wexford tax warehouse was received on 6 February and the application was allowed, under the standard conditions, with effect from 13 February.</P>
    <P>The brewing company have complained about the Revenue Commissioner's interpretation of Council Directive 92/12/EEC.  The Commissioners inform me that they have at all times fully complied with the requirements of this directive in relation to this matter.  The delays experienced by the company in this case have been due to the company's failure to supply correct information in the first instance and to follow procedures by submitting the necessary applications for approval.</P>

      <P>The price, ex-manufacturer, of drugs and medicines prescribable and reimburseable in the general medical services scheme and in the community drug schemes is controlled through a mechanism of an agreement between the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association and the Irish Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association.  In the case of aspirin products generally, I am not aware that there is any significant increase in price over the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>In the case of products containing 75 milligrams of aspirin, intended for the management of cardiovascular disease and in respect of which there are now three products available, it appears that a significant price increase has occurred.  This apparent price increase has arisen out of the placing on the market of two new proprietary forms of the product which had previously only been available in a non-proprietary form, at a trade price of £1 per hundred tablets.  This remains the position today.</P>
      <P>In February 1997 dispersible aspirin tablets 75 milligrams was placed on the market in a proprietary form on the basis of an authorisation granted by the Irish Medicines Board.  The trade price of this new proprietary product was £2.94 for 28 tablets.  This product complied fully with the terms of the pricing agreement in place and, accordingly, was admitted to the GMS scheme. The authorisation holder of this proprietary form was the distributor in this country of the previous non-proprietary product.  On the introduction of the proprietary form, the non-proprietary form immediately ran into short supply.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of many complaints about the lack of availablility of the non-proprietary product and the apparent price increase the Department wrote to the company concerned seeking an explanation regarding the non-availability of the non-proprietary form of the product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the supply problem in regard to the lower priced non-proprietary form of dispersible aspirin tablets 75 milligrams BP is now <Col N="583" /> remedied and that supplies of this product are available on request in pharmacies.</P>

      <P>I was pleased to be in a position to provide £16 million additional funding for services to persons with a mental handicap in 1998 to continue the process of delivering on the Government's commitment to provide additional services in line with the needs outlined in An Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap 1997-2001, and to strengthen existing services.  Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are currently being agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.  As not all health board regions have submitted their plans to my Department in respect of 1998 I am therefore not in a position at present to indicate the new services which will be made available this year.</P>
      <P>A programme of new building is essential for the delivery of the services required to meet the needs which have been identified in the assessment of need.  I am, therefore, putting in place a £30 million capital programme for mental handicap services to run over four years in tandem with the assessment of need, beginning this year with the capital allocation of £5.25 million which I have already mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional funding of £16 million was made available in 1997 for the further development of <Col N="585" /> services to persons with a mental handicap.  The additional services provided by this funding included 240 new residential-respite places and 400 new day places.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic treatment services in the Cavan-Monaghan area is the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board and the waiting lists for treatment are maintained by the board.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the board that a total of 631 persons are on current waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in the Cavan-Monaghan area.</P>
      <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment, it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected-handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity-handicap.  The average waiting times for treatment in the Cavan-Monaghan area are currently as follows: Category A, 326 days; Category B, 1,163 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> I accept that these waiting periods are unsatisfactory. However, the health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the Dental Health Action Plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through the introduction of a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  In addition to clinical duties, a primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate training to sub-consultant level for health board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available since prescriptions for methadone can be prescribed on the general medical services scheme or by private prescription.  It would not be appropriate to request information about such prescriptions except in the context of an official inquiry into the prescribing practices of particular general practitioners in accordance with the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984. Information is, however, readily available in relation to the number who are attending this pharmacy and are being dispensed methadone in accordance with the protocol for prescribing methadone.  The number involved is 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that recommendations concerning the prescribing and dispensing of methadone to opiate misusers have been circulated to all pharmacists and general practitioners following a report by an expert group set up to assess the use of methadone treatment in opiate misuse.  The group's report examines specifically the protocols for good practice in the prescribing and dispensing of methadone and points to appropriate controls which might be put in place. It also sets out the basis on which methadone treatment should continue to be developed and recommends a concise framework for the future operation of the scheme.  With a view to implementing these recommendations my Department has written to each general practitioner and pharmacist nation-wide requesting that they become involved in the protocol as required.  In line with this strategy the Eastern Health Board is actively recruiting additional general practitioners and pharmacists in each <Col N="589" /> community into the treatment of drug misusers and my officials are in continuous contact with the board regarding drug treatment service developments in the Dublin 8 area.  So far satellite clinics have been established at Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House and Merchants Quay.  As new doctors and pharmacists come into the methadone scheme, it is expected that this will reduce the number of drug misusers who visit any individual general practitioner's surgery or pharmacy and relieve the problems associated with high numbers.</P>
    <P>The report recommends that patients attending any general practitioner or pharmacist should be from the immediate locality.  In addition it proposes limits on the numbers attending any individual general practitioner or pharmacy.  It acknowledges that in order to encourage more general practitioners and pharmacists to become involved in the scheme, appropriate supports such as training must be put in place.  Under the terms of the scheme proposed in the report any person seeking a prescription must be registered with the central treatment list, must have a treatment card with a name of a general practitioner and a named pharmacy, and may only receive methadone from that pharmacy.  This should also lead to restricted numbers attending pharmacies participating in the scheme and thereby reduce social problems associated with congregations of large numbers of addicts.  A committee, comprised of representatives from the Eastern Health Board, the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the General Medical Services (Payments) Board and the Department of Health and Children has been established with responsibility for implementing the recommendations contained in the report. The committee's main objective will be to ensure that all general practitioners and pharmacists providing methadone treatment, do so in accordance with the arrangements in the report.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations in the group's report will result in strict control on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone in the treatment of opiate misuse and will allow for the more even distribution of treatment thus relieving the problems arising in the area mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Under section 26 of the Child Care Act, a court may appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child in any proceedings under Part IV or Part VI of the Act, which relate to care proceedings and children in the care of a health board respectively, where the child is not a party and the court is satisfied that it is in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so.</P>
      <P>These arrangements are made at local level at the discretion of the judge and, in the interests of providing an independent voice for the child, guardian <i>ad litem</i> services are often provided by voluntary organisations active in the child care area.

      <P>The development of a comprehensive child and adolescent psychiatric service in each health board area has been identified as a priority in my Department's health strategy and a consultantled service is now available in each health board.

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of <Col N="592" /> child and adolescent psychiatric services in Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  The board has established a working group to examine and consider services required for adolescents in the future.  The development of day programmes specifically for adolescents who present with significant emotional, behavioural, educational and family problems is seen as a priority by the board.  Some adolescents whose own welfare, or that of others, is seriously at risk, may require care and treatment in a setting where their liberty is restricted and the establishment of the special care units for this purpose is also being examined by the board.</P>

The preliminary report of the Laghey sewerage scheme was approved by my Department in 1992.  The revised preliminary report for the Ardara sewerage scheme, and contract documents for the Glencolmcille sewerage scheme have been submitted to my Department.  Given the high level of commitments under my Department's water and sewerage services investment programme, I cannot say when it may be possible to advance these proposals all of which must rely on being fully funded by the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 206 and 212 together.</P>
      <P>The EU negotiating position in advance of the Kyoto Conference in December 1997 proposed that developed country parties, individually or jointly, should reduce emissions levels for carbon dioxide, CO 2, methane, CH 4, and nitrous oxide, N 2 O, together by at least 7.5 per cent and 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2005 and 2010 respectively. This was not a unilateral commitment and was subject to the acceptance of comparable commitments by other developed countries.  The communication from the European Commission &ldquo;Climate Change &mdash; The EU Approach for Kyoto&rdquo;, published in October 1997, concluded &ldquo;that the (EU) emission reduction targets are technically feasible and economically manageable in the EU only if all industrialised countries make comparable reduction efforts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In December 1997 the Council of Environment Ministers was advised that the Commission will, for the meeting of the Environment Council in March 1998, present an analysis of the move from an objective of -15 per cent for three gases to an objective of -8 per cent for the six gases now covered by the protocol so that the effects can be assessed precisely.  The Council also noted that the Commission will review, for discussion at the Environment Council in June 1998, the Communication which it had put forward for the Kyoto Conference.</P>
      <P>Ireland will be actively participating at EU level in the detailed consideration of the issues involved.  I have already indicated my intention to adhere to the level of ambition implicit in Ireland's indicative national growth limitation target of 15 per cent which was part of the internal burden sharing agreement associated with the EU negotiating position.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 213 together.</P>
      <P>The Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change provides for certain flexibility mechanisms for parties in achieving compliance with their legally binding commitments to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These mechanisms include the optional use of a 1995 base year for hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride; joint implementation on the basis of project related investment by one developed country in the territory of another; and the creation of a clean development mechanism to assist developing countries in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the Convention.</P>
      <P>The Protocol also provides that developed countries may participate in emissions trading for the purposes of fulfilling their greenhouse gas emission limitation and reduction commitments, provided that any such trading is supplemented to domestic action.  The relevant principles, modalities, rules and guidelines, in particular for verification, reporting and accountability, are to be defined at the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP4) in Buenos Aires in November 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Protocol requires parties which have directly ensured afforestation, reforestation and deforestation since 1990 to offset the amount of carbon sequestered in these sinks against their target.  This is a restricted approach to the counting of sinks, linked to quantifiable human action. Further negotiations on modalities, rules and guidelines are required before additional sinks related to human activities may be allowed in future.</P>
      <P>In advance of the meetings in June 1998 of the subsidiary bodies to the Convention, which are expected to consider certain of these aspects of the Protocol, the EU is working towards the adoption of a common position.  These meetings will prepare for COP4, at which the same aspects will be addressed further.  Throughout the negotiations leading to the Kyoto Protocol, the EU wished to avoid a situation where unwarranted flexibility in the terms of the Protocol could dilute the commitment to real action.  This consideration, which I support, will continue to inform the EU approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> It is the Government's intention to comply with the requirements of the Protocol on the basis of joint fulfilment of the commitments by the EU as a whole after discussions on the internal burden sharing between member states are completed.</P>

The legal provisions governing motor tax are based on associations between the particular vehicle and its taxation category, determined by reference to factors such as engine size, type of vehicle and the purposes for which it is used.  The tax disc issued is based on these details.  There would be major administrative difficulties in varying the system as suggested by the Deputy, particularly in moving away from the practice of taxing on a monthly basis.

      <P>An application from Athlone Urban District Council for a grant of £200,000 towards the overall cost of a swimming pool to be built as part of the Athlone Regional Sports Centre was received in my Department in December 1992.  Plans for the proposed swimming pool together with a request for an increased grant of £500,000 were subsequently received in February 1997.  There is a provision of £4 million in my Department's Vote for 1998 for the construction and refurbishment of swimming pools.  This provision is fully committed to projects under construction or fully approved and on which work is shortly due to commence.  It will not therefore be possible to make an allocation for the Athlone Regional Sports Centre from this year's provision.</P>

      <P>For a person in receipt of a contributory social welfare pension to qualify for a qualified adult allowance in respect of his or her spouse, he or she must be wholly or mainly maintaining the spouse.  A spouse is regarded as wholly or mainly maintained where his or her income is not greater than £60 per week.  In the case of savings this would allow for a person to have capital of up to £32,800 and still be regarded for social welfare legislation purposes as a qualified adult.</P>
      <P>In this regard also any income solely of the person in receipt of the contributory pension is not taken into account in determining whether the qualified adult allowance is payable-only the income of the spouse himself or herself is taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of automatically providing a qualified adult allowance for a person who qualifies for a contributory social welfare pension, regardless of the income of his or her spouse, is not readily available.  However, it would be likely to have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  It would also have implications <Col N="602" /> for the treatment of qualified adults in the social welfare code generally.  In the case of a contributory old age pensioner, whose wife is in receipt of carer's allowance, the combined income would place them in excess of the limit for the back to school clothing and footwear scheme.  Any increase in the income limits, or to allow a disregard of certain specified income types, would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>My Department is in the process of taking over responsibility for the legislation governing the civil registration system.  The existing legislation dates back to the 1850s and needs to be thoroughly examined and overhauled so that a more modern civil registration system can be put in place to meet current and future needs.  In this regard there are a number of issues, such as the computerisation of the general register office data and the re-organisation of the General Register Office itself, which will have to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> I understand that the current situation with regard to venues for marriage is civil marriages may only take place in the office of the appropriate registrar and exceptions to this rule are only allowed on grounds of ill health of one of the parties to the proposed marriage.  In general, there are no civil law restrictions on the time or place of a Roman Catholic marriage.  Except in the cases of marriage celebrated by special licence, Church of Ireland marriages must be celebrated in a church or chapel.</P>
    <P>Any relevant proposals, including those contained in the Family Law Bill presented by Senator Kathleen O'Meara to allow civil marriages to take place in venues other than a registrar's office, a church or a chapel will be addressed in the context of an overall review of the civil registration system.</P>

      <P>There is an enhanced emphasis in my Department's programmes and grant schemes on supporting families and parenting, and additional resources were provided in the 1998 budget for marriage and child counselling services, the family mediation service and family and community resource centres.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently taken over, from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, responsibility for making grants to organisations engaged in marriage and child counselling.  I hope to be in a position to announce shortly the procedure to be followed by such organisations in applying for these grants. Organisations such as the ACCORD centre in Tralee will then be able to make their case for funding in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to reduce the pension age for old age contributory and non-contributory pension.  The cost of reducing the pension age by one year is estimated to be in the order of £35 million in a full year.  Any reduction in the pension age would have major financial implications and could be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>In this case the persons concerned are husband and wife.  The husband was in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £51.10 based on a means assessment of £96 per week, derived from income from farming.  His payment included allowances in respect of his wife and three children.  This assessment was carried out in 1993.</P>
      <P>Following an investigation of the case, means from the holding were re-assessed at £170 per week, subsequently reduced to £152 per week. Based on this there is no entitlement to unemployment assistance.</P>

      <Quest>the arrangements, if any, which are made by the National Archives to notify other archive repositories, including local county libraries, of the availability of records from Government Departments when the National Archives on their examination of these records have no interest in them; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>No specific administrative arrangements are made to notify other archive repositories of the availability of records from Government Departments when the National Archives has no interest in them. However, when appraising departmental records, the National Archives takes into account the fact that other repositories might be interested in records which are not of interest to it.</P>
      <P>There are two legislative procedures whereby such records can be made available for preservation in another repository.  Under one procedure the records must in the first instance be transferred to the National Archives for preservation as archives but can subsequently be transferred to another repository in accordance with section 9 of the National Archives Act, 1986. Alternatively, under section 14 of the Act, another repository can be approved as a place of deposit where particular departmental records can be preserved as archives.</P>
      <P>To date neither of these procedures has been used for the purpose referred to by the Deputy. The National Archives has not disposed of any archives under section 9.  A small number of other repositories has been approved as places of desposit under section 14, but in each case the reason for this being done was not that the records deposited there do not warrant preservation by the National Archives, but rather that the records deposited there are of a specialised character and can best be preserved by the other repository.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the delivery of State services through Irish to Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht, and indeed to such speakers outside the Gaeltacht, is obviously unsatisfactory and has been well documented in recent years.  It is to this inadequacy of service that the Minister of State was referring in his speech and the comments he made, and the examples he gave, were aimed at highlighting this inadequacy.  I fully support his view that the supply of these services through Irish is inadequate and needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the Minister of State outlined in his speech the steps he proposes to take to improve the position in relation to the delivery of State services through Irish in the Gaeltacht and I would direct the Deputy's attention to those positive proposals.</P>

      <P>However, I can inform the Deputy that I am sympathetically disposed to carrying out some conservation works on this national monument, to be funded from Exchequer sources at my disposal, on a phased basis over a number of years. I would hope that these works could commence sometime in 1999.</P>

    <P>The provision in my Department's estimate for 1998 in respect of Irish Genealogy Ltd. is <Col N="611" /> £100,000.  The staff resources of the company comprise the chief executive and an administrative assistant on secondment from the ESB and a project manager who is employed by the Irish Family History Foundation.</P>
    <P>The day to day administrative and operational affairs of Irish Genealogy Ltd. are matters for that company.  The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Genealogical Project was reported on critically by the Comptroller and Auditor General in a value for money examination published at the end of 1996.  Responsibility for overseeing this project was transferred to my Department from the Department of An Taoiseach at the end of 1997.  I am seeking sanction for the additional staff resources I consider essential to enable my Department to take on this extra workload.</P>
    <P>When the necessary resources have been made available it is the intention of my Department to enter into discussions with Irish Genealogy Ltd. with a view to determining whether the deficiencies highlighted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are capable of satisfactory resolution with a view to establishing a marketable and viable product within a realistic time frame.</P>

As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 258, 295 and 296 of 10 February 1998 I am committed to providing modern court accommodation in Youghal as quickly as possible.  In order to achieve this my Department has put proposals to Cork County Council in relation to the project. These proposals include the provision of suitable District Court office accommodation as well as courtroom and ancillary facilities for the judge, legal practitioners and other court uses.  Provision of wheelchair access and suitable toilet facilities are also envisaged.  Cork County Council have been asked to draw up plans to take these requirements into account and to provide a preliminary cost plan for the proposals.</P>
      <P>My Department has also asked Cork County Council to carry out a conservation study of the building and site given the necessary statutory consultation process which must be undertaken with the Heritage Council.  The Department will also consult with the interested groups including the judiciary staff and legal practitioners when draft plans have been prepared.</P>
      <P>The plans and preliminary costings sought from Cork County Council will address foundation, roof, support, stonework and other problems which have been identified.</P>
      <P>When draft plans to meet my Department's requirements are available from Cork County Council it will be necessary to obtain the approval of the Heritage Council for the remedial works involved.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide a timescale for the project but the Deputy may be assured that my Department is working in co-operation with Cork County Council to ensure that it will be provided without delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1990 the Government decided that local authorities should be relieved of the financial burden of providing courthouse accommodation and that such costs should be met in future by my Department.  The courts building programme is now well under way and the budget for new and refurbished courthouses has been increasing steadily each year.</P>
      <P>Since 1991 as part of that programme major refurbishment works have been carried out at the following court venues: Letterkenny, Athlone, Dún Laoghaire, Donegal Town, Galway, Cork District Court, Carlow, Dungarvan, Ballinasloe, Castlecomer, Abbeyfeale, Clonmel, Midleton, Ballina, Naas, Carrick-on-Shannon, Portarlington and at the Four Courts, Riverbank and Richmond Courthouses in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Refurbishment work is currently under way at Edenderry, Roscrea, Ennis, Portlaoise, Cork Circuit Court, Rathdowney and I will be opening a new purpose-built courthouse in Tallaght very shortly.</P>
      <P>Much remains to be done to bring court accommodation generally up to a standard which is commensurate with a proper service to the public. This Government is fully committed to the provision of modern court facilities for all court users as indicated by the unprecedented level of funding of £12 million which I secured for improvement works this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 268 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that statistics regarding road traffic accidents are not compiled by them in such a way as to readily provide the details which the Deputy requests.</P>
      <P>However, details in relation to all road traffic accidents reported to the Garda authorities are supplied by the Garda to the National Roads Authority, St. Martin's House, Waterloo Road, Dublin 4.  A detailed report on road accidents entitled Road Accident Facts is prepared and published annually by that authority.  The most recent report, which is in respect of 1996, was published in October of last year and is available directly from the authority (Telephone (01) 6602511 or Fax (01 668009).</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269 and 272 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the position concerning the <Col N="618" /> Garda mast at Kilmacow and I would refer the Deputies to my reply of 12 November 1997 in which I pointed out that following the receipt of correspondence in my Department and in the Office of Public Works from the Kilmacow development group, I asked the Garda to re-examine their requirements to see if a lower mast would suffice.  The Garda subsequently advised that they would accept a 50 foot mast for the time being but that it was unlikely that such a mast would meet their longer-term requirements.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of consultation with the local community, the Office of Public Works has advised that in accordance with Part XIII of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, they gave notice of their intention to erect a Garda station and mast to the local authority and in the daily newspapers on 6 November 1997.</P>
    <P>However, I understand that the Office of Public Works omitted to erect a site notice as required under the regulations and that they now propose to regularise the situation under the Planning Acts.  Erection of the proposed mast will be deferred until this has been done.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resouces, inform me that they are aware of the speculation in relation to the possible move of Wimbledon Football Club to Dublin and they are also conscious of the possible implications of such a move.</P>
      <P>In the event of a definite decision being made to move the club to Dublin the Garda authorities will be made aware of the required details at an early stage and they are confident that, in partnership with all concerned, the policing requirements for any such move are well within the capabilities of the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <P>*Two printers assigned to Mountbellew Station in 1995-96 Area HQ for rural policing.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that telephony systems have been replaced and are being upgraded on an ongoing basis in stations throughout both divisions.  The current national radio network is being supported.  I understand that hand portables and mobiles have been replaced during the period and that plans are being developed for the replacement of the national radio network with new digital technology.</P>
    <P>The deployment of official vehicles within a particular division is a matter for the divisional officer.  I understand from the Garda authorities that the total number of vehicles and motorcycles allocated to the Galway West Division is 34 and for the Roscommon-Galway East Division is 25. In addition, vehicles attached to other specialised units within the Garda Síochána are available to provide assistance and patrolling duties to areas within the divisions both generally and as special needs arise.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities further inform me that the provision of funds is controlled by their finance section and that every application for same is dealt with on a meritorious basis.  They add that extra resources may be provided as the need arises from other Garda divisions.</P>

      <P>I understand that customs have six dogs trained in drugs detection.  They are based in Dublin Airport, Dublin Port, Rosslare, Cork, Shannon and Sligo.  However, they can be deployed to other areas as the need arises.  These dogs are used by customs officers in searches of premises, transport vehicles and vessels (cars, trucks, buses, yachts, ships and aircraft), passengers and freight cargo.

      <P>Bord Fáilte Éireann, which is funded under my Department's Vote, is responsible for the international marketing of Irish tourism. Included in their marketing activity is the promotion of rural tourism, angling, riding and many other products.  I understand that all these products are highlighted in the board's main market books and at all the trade and consumer fairs attended by Bord Fáilte.  I further understand that there are a number of co-operative marketing groups for farmhouses, angling, equestrian and other holidays who work in partnership with the board and the regional tourism authorities to promote their products.</P>
      <P>I expect that the substantial increase in marketing funds which I have secured for Bord Fáilte will benefit niche product marketing considerably in 1998.  In addition, following the mid-term review of the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, increased resources have been allocated to the marketing sub-programme, which is implemented by Bord Fáilte, specifically to support the marketing of tourism angling between now and the end of the programme.</P>

      <P>My Department has received requests for a remedial teaching service, with supporting documentation, from the schools specifically mentioned by the Deputies.  A total of 32 schools in County Mayo have applied to my Department for a remedial teaching service.  Particulars of the schools in question are as follows.  In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-8 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-8 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 remedial teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The main criterion applied in the selection process is the number of children who have been assessed as being at or below the tenth percentile on appropriate standardised tests of attainment.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the remedial teacher area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional remedial teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  Discipline matters in schools are the responsibility of the managerial authorities of individual schools.  Generally, my Department does not get involved in decisions made by school authorities in this matter.</P>
      <P>A full report has been received from the school in this case.  A complaint was made to the board of management of the school in question alleging that another named pupil of the school had been assaulted while travelling home on the school bus. Following detailed consideration and investigation into the incident, two pupils were suspended from the school.  Before arriving at its decision, the board met with parents of both pupils.  It would appear that full and proper procedures were followed by the board and that the rules of natural justice were applied.  In addition, the board offered counselling to the pupils for the period of their suspension.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the board will consider readmitting the pupils concerned upon receipt of a written undertaking countersigned by their parents in relation to their future behaviour.  Arrangements are being made to involve my Department's inspectorate in the case with a view to ensuring that the parents and pupils fully understand the position of the board and the pupils resume their education as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Staffing levels overall in my Department are determined within Government policy. Resources and allocations within areas are kept under constant review within resources and this Government policy.</P>
      <P>The work of the examination branch is a yearly cycle which rises to a peak in the summer months. The peak period is from the start of the certificate examinations in June to the issue of the junior certificate results in September.  The resources employed in managing this pattern comprise a core permanent staffing complement augmented by temporary employees and overtime working. In so far as I have knowledge of the administration of national terminal examinations in other countries I understand that such examinations are managed with a similar mix of staffing resources.</P>
      <P>With regard to the organisation of the oral examinations a number of processes are involved including the appointment of examiners, arranging marking conferences and providing examiners with material to enable them to conduct the tests.</P>
      <P>Industrial action is being taken by members of the Public Service Executive Union which is affecting overtime working among other issues. This has impacted upon some of the preparatory processes required to hold the oral examinations.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to resolve the industrial relations problems and hope that a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at shortly.</P>

      <P>The school in question was one of 54 schools included in the disadvantaged areas scheme for funding purposes when the scheme was last expanded in 1994.  As an alternative to a further widening of the scheme, and following in-depth studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre, a new pilot project, <Col N="630" /> the Breaking the Cycle project, was launched in May 1996.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing my Department's overall response to the problem of educational disadvantage.  My objective is to ensure that all available resources are properly targeted so that children who are educationally disadvantaged receive the support necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
      <P>In the event of additional resources being targeted on pupils in disadvantaged areas, schools will be selected for support on the basis of criteria which will have regard to each school's prevailing needs at the time of selection.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the application for the appointment of a resource teacher to the school in question.  However, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional resource teacher posts to primary schools.  In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 32 resource teacher posts have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for access to a resource teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the resource teacher <Col N="631" /> area, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be fully considered in the context of any additional resource teacher allocations which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I understand that the bus service referred to by the Deputy involves a number of schools, including the school in question, and therefore is constrained from providing an additional service on days on which the school closes for a half day.  Where schools share transport, they are expected to co-ordinate services in an effective and efficient manner, particularly in regard to school holidays and closures.</P>
      <P>I regret that it would not be open to my Department to provide additional transport services to facilitate schools which alter their closing times to such an extent that they cannot be co-ordinated with other services in their area.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in the policy document An Action Programme for the Millennium. This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates, where I have provided for an overall increase of 9 per cent in expenditure on primary education for 1998.</P>
      <P>In this context provision has been made for a £5 increase in the capitation grant for primary schools.  At 11 per cent, this increase represents a start in the process of increasing capitation at primary level.  However, it is important to note that the difference in grant level reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second level schools are greater on a unit cost basis than in primary schools.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools will continue to receive priority over the coming years.</P>

      <P>Detailed arrangements for job sharing by clerical and administrative staff have been circularised to vocational education committees in the form of Circular F11/89.  These arrangements allow for job sharing by any two permanent full-time members of staff in the same grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> My Department gave approval, on an exceptional basis, for an officer to participate in the job sharing scheme on the basis that any substitution or acting up allowances to be paid by the committee to an existing officer would be paid in accordance with terms agreed for such allowances through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for clerical and administration of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the committee sought sanction for a variation on these terms citing a previous departure which was approved by my Department. My Department has considered the situation and concluded that the case quoted did not have due regard for the agreed terms governing such payments which are of general application in the sector.  Accordingly, while my Department accepts that the officer concerned in another county may hold the enhanced allowance on a personal basis only, it does not accept that this can constitute a precedent for the sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>My Department, in partnership with Telecom Éireann, is distributing a questionnaire to first and second level schools.  The information obtained will, <i>inter alia</i>, provide information on the current position in all schools with regard to computer facilities.  As stated in Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy Framework for the New Millennium, each first and second level school will be assisted by my Department in acquiring at least one multimedia computer system with Internet access before the end of 1999.  Additionally Telecom Éireann has agreed to supply each school with a multimedia computer system by September 1998.</P>

      <P>Under the school transport scheme, where a school has been closed and amalgamated with another, children for whom the closed school would have been the nearest are eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation, even though this may not be the nearest school.  Eligible pupils travel free of charge.</P>
      <P>The children to whom the Deputy refers are not attending their appropriate school by reference to transport under closure and amalgamation conditions.  In the circumstances, I regret that the most these pupils are entitled to is concessionary fare paying to the school which they attend.</P>
      <P>The report of the school transport review committee was published on 21 January 1998 and has been circulated to various interests.  The matter of transport under closure and amalgamation is considered in the report.  I welcome the publication of the report which will afford an opportunity for extensive debate on its contents.  I will give serious consideration and reflect on the product of this debate before making final decisions on any future changes to the school transport system.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the current school year, the supply panel scheme was extended by the provision of a further 30 teachers.  The scheme now operates in 17 locations throughout the country serving a large number of schools.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers was served by the supply panel when it operated as a pilot scheme.  In the context of the development of the scheme, it was necessary to redress difficulties which had presented during the pilot phase.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, a reduction in the number of supply teachers in some locations was deemed appropriate to ensure a more efficient management of the scheme.  A consequence of this action was a reduction in the number of schools in these areas benefiting from the scheme.  I should stress that the reduction in supply teachers in some locations was accompanied by an increase in the number of teachers in other locations.</P>
      <P>The school to which the Deputy refers was one of the schools excluded following the changes to the pilot scheme.  I should emphasise, however, that the school in question is still entitled to engage substitute teachers when necessary from outside of the panel scheme.</P>

      <P>There are 65 primary and eight post primary schools in the areas referred to by the Deputy.  The statistical information sought is not readily available in my Department and the staff time required to assemble it is not justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a 26 per cent decline in births in County Galway in the period from 1986-96.  It would be expected that, in the light of these demographic trends, enrolments in primary and post primary schools will decline, though not necessarily uniformly.  Indeed primary school <Col N="642" /> enrolments generally have already declined in recent years.  The decline in post primary numbers will not be as noticeable due to factors such as increased participation rates, the development of the transition year option and increased numbers attending post leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <P>The teacher allocation to an individual primary or post primary school is made up by the allocation warranted by the enrolment at the end of the preceding September on the basis of the current pupil-teacher ratio together with any approved ex-quota and concessionary posts. Changes in enrolments will be reflected in the approved teacher allocation to schools.</P>
    <P>Amalgamation of schools will only take place following consultations with the relevant local interests and where such will be in the best interests of the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring, through the primary and post primary buildings programmes, that school facilities will be adequate for the needs of the modern curriculum.</P>
