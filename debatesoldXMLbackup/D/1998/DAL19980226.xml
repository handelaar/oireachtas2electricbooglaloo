      <P>I request the Adjournment of the Dáil under standing Order 31 to raise a matter of public importance involving the retention by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment of information that should have been given by her in reply to a parliamentary question and the implication this has for the accountability of the Government to the House.</P>

      <P>If that is the case it is the first time in the history of the House the Leader of the Opposition has not been called on a matter put on the Order of Business.  My concern about accepting this proposal is that the House operates on the basis of co-operation between Government and Opposition Whips.  That is how we are able to conduct orderly business.  One element of co-operation is that the Order of Business for each day is circulated in advance to the Opposition and is, indeed, negotiated to a degree with it on the basis that the Government has the final say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case for the first time for many years the Order of Business contains new matter which was not circulated to the Opposition and the question being put is part of that.  It is probably the first time ever it was not circulated to the Opposition beforehand.  Before we agree this matter, will the Taoiseach tell me why the Order of Business was not circulated to the Opposition in the normal way and why the Government did not abide by <Col N="1484" /> the normal procedures for co-operation in the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is identical to the one that would have been discussed, with the addition of a debate on non-resident accounts.  I regret that was not included earlier, but the Government Whip's office was made aware at 10.05 a.m. that a matter was being raised under Standing Order 31 and it was felt appropriate that we should allow time today for a debate on the issue.  It is an issue of some public importance that dominates the media this morning.  The Tánaiste is in the air so I was unable to contact her.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>She is travelling between one official engagement and another at Shannon Airport. We are offering to the Opposition, which I thought would be helpful, a debate on this issue today by way of statements and questions and answers rather than let it drift into next week.  We have used this practice to deal with urgent matters on many occasions in successive Governments over many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was the Opposition not consulted in the time available?  Why did the Government not avail of Standing Order 31 instead of adopting a different procedure?  Surely this House is governed by Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Government's embarrassment.  There is a matter of courtesy and competence at issue here.  Courtesy would demand that any variation in Standing Orders for today's Order of Business would, at best, have been communicated by fax to the relevant Opposition Whips' offices and, at worst, due to the exigencies of time, they would have received a telephone call.  Neither happened.  I appreciate, as the Taoiseach stated, the validity of Standing Order No. 31 was recognised and rather than have the Chair rule it in order, the Government offered statements.  We are all familiar with that practice, but the House has been insulted by the behaviour and incompetence of the Government's Whip's office by not communicating with us either verbally or in writing about this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of fact that Deputy Brennan knew at 10.25 a.m. but did not make a telephone call or send a fax to the Opposition Whips.  That is some performance.  We know why he is not in the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having known that the Chair was likely to grant a debate under Standing Order 31 and having regard to the nature of the matter, the Government proceeded to determine, without consultation with the Whips, the manner and method by which this matter would be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There was discourtesy followed by an arbitrary decision as to how the matter would be addressed bearing in mind that the party that raised this issue in the first place will not be party to these arrangements under existing Standing Orders.  The arrangement before us is simply not acceptable and I suggest that the Whips meet to discuss the format that should be adopted to decide business today.  Do I take it from what the Taoiseach said that the Tánaiste, who is central to the debate, is not available this morning and will, perhaps, be available in the afternoon?  Will she, rather than the Minister of State, deal with the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We endeavoured to contact her about 10.10 a.m. I do not know what the Ceann Comhairle's position will be in regard to the Standing Order 31 motion.  I thought that as a matter of courtesy to the House we offered time for a debate on important issues.  If the House is not satisfied with the way the time has been dealt with, the matter can be agreed among the Whips. We have no difficulty with that.  I resent the insinuation that when time is offered to debate a major issue we are being unhelpful to the House. What happened this morning relates to a time factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think only one motion under Standing Order 31 has been granted in the 21 years I have been a Member.  To make the assumption that the Ceann Comhairle would have repeated that 21 year old rule this morning is some hell of an assumption and I certainly did not make it.  I would be satisfied if the Whips meet and decide whether Members want a debate on this issue, which I thought was of some importance, and the time they want for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach said, but there are two issues involved.  The first relates to the normal courtesy of time and communication. Some 25 &mdash; or at least 15 minutes &mdash;<Col N="1487" /> elapsed between the decision being made and the Opposition being informed.  Fax machines or telephones were not availed of.  We were not consulted in any way.  The first we knew of the variation on this morning's Order of Business was when the Ceann Comhairle informed me that as statements were to be held later today the Standing Order motion fell.  That was the first I heard of it.  In the course of the Taoiseach speaking, the order was delivered to me in the Chamber and not, I understand, to members of other Opposition parties.  I propose that the Whips meet immediately after we dispose of the Order of Business and agree a formula on how the matter should be dealt with.  It is essential that the Tánaiste is in the House to answer questions.  I gather she is flying from Brussels to Shannon.</P>

I do not think we can make an order in the House without a specific proposal.  A meeting of the Whips is not a specific proposal that can be agreed in the House.

We should make a decision on the floor of the House on the overall time for the debate.  The necessary changes to be made to No. 4 on the Order of Business in relation to the allocation of time would properly be the subject of detailed discussion by the Whips and a variation can be introduced in the House in due course.  I suggest that from 1 o'clock we start with statements on Irish registered non-resident companies and if the Tánaiste is not available at that time no doubt the Minister of State can lead the debate and avail of the opportunity to set the record straight in relation to the allegations he made against Deputy Rabbitte yesterday.</P>

I wish to correct one issue which was stated inadvertently that the Government made a decision at 10.05 a.m. The Government heard of the request for a Standing Order 31 debate at 10.05 a.m. and tried to contact the Tánaiste.  In the normal course of events if a Standing Order 31 debate was taken &mdash; I have seen it taken only once in 21 years &mdash; it would start immediately.  That is a nonsense because one could not prepare for a proper debate.  The reason they are not taken is that one cannot start an intelligent debate immediately.  I thought this morning it was extremely helpful to the House, on the issue that has arisen, that we gave time today, even on a limited Dáil day, but unfortunately that is not accepted by some Members of the Opposition.  So far as anyone may have thought I said something derogatory about Deputy Barrett, I did not but he was seeking to interrupt me.

      <P>The issue of Irish registered non-resident companies has been under examination for some considerable time to see what action can be taken under company or tax law.  It has been looked at by a number of interdepartmental and ministerial groups.  The view is that amendments to company and tax law are probably required.  Most of the Irish registered non-resident companies are probably not productive but some are extremely important to US multinational companies in particular which legally use them to a considerable extent.  The legislation, which is complex, needs to be amended to ensure that those we would be far better off without, of which there are many, are dealt with without affecting the overall structure of company or tax law.  That is what the interdepartmental groups have been working on for some considerable time.  I hope they will conclude their deliberations during 1998.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) Act, 1980 to take account of new developments in the area of plant breeder's rights, which have been adopted internationally since the Act came into force and to provide for Ireland's ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, as revised in 1991.</P>
      <P>States which are party to the convention constitute the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, known as UPOV.</P>
      <P>UPOV currently comprises 13 member states of the European Union and 22 other states including the USA, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The convention as revised in 1991 was signed by Ireland, subject to ratification, in February 1992 and the proposed Bill will give effect to the provisions of that convention.</P>
      <P>The Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) Act, 1980 provided for the establishment of a system of plant breeder's rights in Ireland based on the principles set down in the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants as revised in 1978.  The central principle of the UPOV Convention is that the breeder of a new variety of plant is granted a title of protection, the effect of which is that the breeder has the exclusive right to reproduce and sell material of the variety and to authorise others to do so on conditions which he may specify throughout the territory where he has been granted plant breeder's rights.  He can also apply to the appropriate authorities in other states to have the same rights granted to him in respect of his variety.  Accordingly breeders are enabled to obtain royalties from reproduction of their plant material and protection against infringements of their rights.</P>
      <P>The Irish plant breeder's rights system is administered by the Office of Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights.  The controller who is an official of the Department of Agriculture and Food holds his office under the general supervision and direction of the Minister for Agriculture and Food but acts on his own and not under the name of the Minister.  Under the Act, the controller is responsible for any decision taken under the Irish plant breeder's rights system including the granting of compulsory licences.  The scale of operation of this office is modest but nonetheless since 1980 it has received 487 applications for plant breeder's rights and has issued 354 grants of plant breeder's rights of which 112 are still extant, published 34 Official Journals of Plant Varieties and maintained the Register of Plant Breeders' Rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland acceded to the UPOV Convention in 1981 because Irish plant breeding interests needed protection against infringement of varieties bred by them, many of which they also exported.  As a country where agriculture is of <Col N="1499" /> such importance we needed to have access to the very best varieties of grasses, sugar beet and cereals which might not otherwise have been available to us in the absence of a national system of protection for plant variety rights.  Most of the varieties for which plant breeder's rights are taken out are varieties that are of very considerable significance to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The main conditions to be satisfied for the grant of a breeder's right are that the variety must be novel, distinct from other varieties of the species, uniform, stable in its reproduction and be given a suitable name or other designation.  Novelty is essentially a legal condition to be satisfied at the time of filing the application for breeder's rights.  Distinctness, uniformity and stability are established by means of growing trials under agreed protocols.  The results of such technical examinations can be purchased from other member states under bilateral agreements.</P>
    <P>In relation to agricultural crops, the breeder's right is circumscribed to the extent that under the various marketing of seed regulations only seed of a variety which has been officially certified by the Department of Agriculture and Food may be marketed.  The seed can only be of varieties registered in the &ldquo;National Catalogue of Agricultural Plant Varieties&rdquo; or the &ldquo;European Community Common Catalogue of varieties of Agricultural Plant Species&rdquo; which is an amalgam of all member state catalogues.  Acceptance of varieties into the national catalogue is based on growing trials which establish value for cultivation and satisfactory use under Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>There have been many advances in the biological sciences since the UPOV Convention of 1978 was signed and those changes have impacted on the legal protection of new varieties.  The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants was revised in 1991 to strengthen the protection afforded to holders of plant breeders' rights and to enable them to obtain a fair return on the investment made in their varieties from all the persons making commercial use of such varieties.</P>
    <P>Under the existing convention there were clear weaknesses in the system in that other breeders could use a protected variety in order to produce a new essentially derived variety to compete with the protected variety without payment of any royalties to the breeder.  This problem arises from the unqualified nature of the breeder's exemption in the 1978 UPOV Convention.</P>
    <P>The plant breeder's exemption is the cornerstone of the plant breeder's rights system in that a plant variety may be freely used to create other varieties by crossing of two varieties and selecting from their progeny a variety that will be better than the original.  However, various plant improvement methods such as selecting mutations of vegetatively propagated varieties or back-crossing sexually reproduced varieties have had the effect that often, at little cost, another breeder produces a new variety from the protected <Col N="1500" /> variety.  Such a variety is considered an essentially derived variety and will possess all the characteristics of the initial variety and will differ from the initial variety in one or a limited number of characteristics.  The second breeder thereby takes full advantage of the investment made by the breeder of the initial variety without making any contribution to the costs of the development of the initial variety.  The revised 1991 UPOV Convention therefore discourages such types of &ldquo;cosmetic&rdquo; breeding.  Additionally breeders were concerned at the extent of the use by farmers of seed saved from previous harvests to grow their next crop without payment of financial contribution for use of the protected variety.</P>
    <P>The European Community, under Council Regulation 2100/94 EEC, has set up a separate system of community plant variety rights, based on the UPOV Convention but operating parallel to the national plants breeders' rights system in each member state.  Under the community system breeders can obtain with one application complete protection throughout the European Union for their variety, but they are precluded from exercising national rights in respect of the same variety or from subsequently submitting applications to individual countries in the EU for a national grant of plant breeders' rights.  The Community legislation, however, requires member states to provide corresponding penalties for infringements of community rights as apply for infringements of national rights and I have provided for this in section 12.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, protection will be extended to all plant genera and species of the plant kingdom whereas heretofore rights applied to varieties of cereals, grasses, potatoes, fruit trees, ornamental shrubs and roses only.  However, in practice, I expect that only a limited number of applications for plant breeder's rights will be received from Irish breeders, namely for the small number of cultivated species on which breeding work is being done and which it is necessary to protect, and from nationals of other member states of UPOV who wish to market selected varieties in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The right to apply for a grant of breeder's right belongs to the breeder and, where the grant is made, the breeder's authorisation is required in order to carry out certain acts of exploitation of the variety.  Section 18 of the draft Bill provides that the breeder's authorisation is required for acts in relation to the propagating material of the protected variety, and in certain circumstances to harvested material of the protected variety.  These are cascading provisions; that is to say, unless the breeder has had a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to propagating material of the protected variety, he can exercise his right in relation to harvested material obtained through unauthorised use of such propagating material.  If the defendant can demonstrate that the breeder has had a reasonable opportunity to exercise his rights in relation to the propagating material the breeder is barred <Col N="1501" /> from exercising his rights against the harvested material in question.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 19 respectively provide for the exhaustion of the breeder's right and for the application of exemptions to the breeder's right which are, however, narrow.  The holder of a breeder's right can only exercise it and be paid royalties once in every production cycle.  Breeder's rights are, however, not exhausted where further propagation of the protected variety takes place.  The minimum period of plant breeder's rights under the Bill is set at 30 years for trees, vines and potatoes and 25 years for all other species. I propose on Committee Stage to introduce an amendment setting a maximum period of protection for any species or plant grouping.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the holder of plant breeder's rights shall have the same rights in respect of a dependent variety.  Dependent varieties are those whose production requires the repeated use of the protected variety, namely hybrid varieties and essentially derived varieties. An essentially derived variety is a variety that is predominantly derived but still clearly distinguishable from the initial variety by a limited number of characteristics.  It is typically obtained by selecting natural or induced mutants within the variety, by back-crossing and transformation by gene technology.</P>
    <P>The extension of rights to the dependent variety means, in plain terms, that the holder of rights in an essentially derived variety cannot exploit the variety without the permission of the holder of rights in the initial variety.  The holder of rights in the initial variety does not, however, hold plant breeder's rights in the essentially derived variety.  It is accordingly envisaged that the two holders will reach a commercial agreement which will allow the holder of rights in the essentially derived variety to exploit them.  If, however, there is no such agreement between the two parties, the holder of rights in the dependent variety may apply to the controller for a compulsory licence where the holder of the rights in the initial variety unreasonably refuses to authorise exploitation of the essentially derived variety.</P>
    <P>A compulsory licence is only issued in the public interest and requires that the holder of the breeder's right in respect of whose variety such a licence is issued shall receive equitable remuneration. Legal provision for compulsory licensing of exclusive rights in the public interest is standard in all member countries of UPOV.</P>
    <P>The 1991 Convention requires a member country of UPOV to safeguard the interest of the breeder during the period between the filing or the publication of the application for the grant of plant breeder's rights and the grant of such rights. The holder of the breeder's rights is entitled to claim equitable remuneration in respect of such acts as would have infringed his exclusive rights had the grant been in force during the period of interim protection.  I have made such provision in section 8.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> Section 19(1)(d) provides for the farm saved seed exemption which has come about more through traditional practices rather than legal rights in the area of protection of intellectual property.  The UPOV Convention of 1991 provides that a breeder's right may be restricted within reasonable limits and, subject to safeguarding the breeder's legitimate interests, permits a farmer to use the farmer's own farm saved seed on his own holding.  The section applies the equivalent provisions under national legislation as apply under European Union regulations for the community protected variety.  The Minister will have powers to specify by order the species, such as cereals, fodder plants, oil and fibre plants and potatoes, to which the restriction applies.  The Minister will by regulations lay down the necessary arrangements to enable the farm saved seed exemption to operate.</P>
    <P>Farmers who have saved seed of varieties of these species will be liable to pay holders of plant variety rights equitable remuneration, which must be sensibly lower than the royalty charged for the use of those protected varieties.  The amount to be charged is for the holders and farmers collectively to decide between themselves.  Small farmers will be exempt from the requirement to pay for the use of the farm saved seed.  Small farmers under community legislation are those whose cereal and fodder plant production area would not exceed 15.13 hectares excluding permanent pasture established more than five years and in the case of potatoes one whose production area does not exceed 6.3 hectares.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when making regulations and orders in connection with the farm saved seed, will apply the provisions of the Community legislation establishing implementing rules on the agricultural exemption for farm saved seed &mdash; Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1768/95 of 24 July 1995.</P>
    <P>A particular problem arises for breeders of ornamental varieties such as rose bushes and pot plants, in that they face major difficulties in enforcing their rights, particularly in relation to royalty payments.  These varieties are easily propagated and pass through many channels before they reach the consumer and are sold from a wide range of sales outlets.  Unless the breeder knows the source of the plants being sold, he cannot establish whether the material being sold has been taken from an authorised propagation.  It is not only the breeders of ornamental plants but also traders who properly pay royalties who are put at a disadvantage by illegal propagation of plant varieties.</P>
    <P>I propose on either Committee or Report Stages to insert a provision to enable breeders to exercise their rights more effectively by tracing plant material back through the supply chain from the retail sales outlet.  Under this provision the holder of a breeder's right for the protected variety or his or her agent will serve an information notice on the trader asking him or her where he or she has obtained the harvested <Col N="1503" /> material being offered for sale.  If the trader does not supply the information within the time limit laid down in the notice, certain presumptions will operate in any subsequent infringement proceedings in the civil case, unless the defendant proves otherwise or shows he or she had a good reason for not supplying the information in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In any proceedings in court between the holder of the rights and the trader, the holder of the breeder's right will have to prove the link between the harvested material which was the subject of the information notice and the harvested material which is the subject of the infringement proceedings in order to activate the presumptions.  The presumptions are that the harvested material was obtained through the unauthorised use of the propagating material, and that the holder did not have a reasonable opportunity before the harvested material was obtained to exercise his or her rights in respect of the unauthorised use of propagating material.</P>
    <P>Any information obtained by means of an information notice can only be used in proceedings in connection with infringement of plant breeder's rights and any abuse of such information can be similarly proceeded against in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for the annulment and cancellation of grants of plant breeder's rights.  Revocation or nullity is retroactive to when the grant was made, whereas cancellation is from the current date.  Revocation or nullity arises where the grant of a breeder's right should not have been made in the first place, while cancellation will arise if the holder fails to meet obligations imposed on him or her arising from the grant of such a right.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on the principles of the UPOV Convention as revised in 1991, which I indicated earlier was signed by Ireland, subject to ratification, in February 1992.  The Bill will establish equitable relations between breeders, between holders of breeder's rights and patent owners, and between holders of breeder's rights for ornamental plants and traders.</P>
    <P>I encourage breeders to retain the scent of ornamental plants, flowers and shrubs.  Many breeding programmes seem to lose the exotic and beautiful scents we used to get when we travelled around the countryside in the old days.</P>

      <P>I know this is not Question Time, but could the Minister indicate in his reply if the other 34 signatories to the convention updated their legislation in a similar way?  It is important to know if there is a degree of unanimity about the operation of the convention.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated he proposed to table an amendment on either Committee or Report Stage &ldquo;to insert a provision in this Bill to enable breeders to exercise their rights more effectively by tracing plant material back through the supply chain from the retail sales outlet&rdquo;.  That applies primarily to ornamental varieties and would be a useful addition to the legislation.</P>
      <P>I understand there was a weakness in the 1978 convention, in that it allowed breeders to use protected varieties to produce new derived varieties to compete with the protected variety, without payment of any royalties to the breeder.  This arose from the unqualified nature of the breeder's exemption in the 1978 convention.  The breeder's exemption is the cornerstone of the plant breeder's rights system, in that a plant variety may be freely used to create new varieties by crossing new varieties and selecting from their progeny a variety which is better than the original. However, the production of the essentially derived variety from the protected variety could be done by using modern plant improvement methods, such as selecting mutations, back crossing and many other methods which I do not fully understand but with which the legislation seeks to deal.  To that extent, we welcome it also.</P>
      <P>The subject of genetic engineering is creating a great deal of controversy at the moment.  Deputy Naughten, who has expertise in that area, will speak on that matter.  There has been a great deal of irrational comment on the issue, with people being frightened by very exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims.  It is incumbent on the Government to lead in this area and promote a debate.  I understand the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is preparing a White Paper on the subject, and the sooner it is published the better. The Oireachtas could also give a lead in the matter by promoting debate and discussion in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised the matter here because the Bill is largely concerned with the ratification of a 1991 convention.  Is legislation which is brought in to ratify a measure dating from 1991 capable of dealing with all the technological and genetic <Col N="1505" /> advances which have occurred in the interim? Does the Bill need to be updated to deal with modern technology, genetic advances and so on? For example, does the Bill control the extraction of very large royalties by large multinational monopolies in the area of genetic engineering? Can those with a worldwide monopoly on a particular breed who are in possession of plant varieties derived from genetic engineering charge what they like for royalties or is there a control mechanism in the Bill?  We support this Bill on Second Stage but will reserve our position on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is important in that it protects the rights of plant breeders who put considerable effort into their work.  This is an aspect of agriculture on which I have not spent much time, but I want to say something about potatoes which might run into trouble under this Bill if it is not clarified.</P>
      <P>This area is of great importance to the human race and to the world generally in that when scientists produce a new variety of plant, it can eventually enter the human food chain.  Against that background it is reasonable that the rights of people who are capable of producing new varieties are protected in the same way as the rights of people in the music industry.  What this Bill proposes to do is similar to what IMRO does for the music business.</P>
      <P>I understand, from what the Minister said, that this Bill is a general updating of the legislation in this area.  It has been stated twice this morning that we are one of 35 signatories to it.  What worries me is what the other countries might be doing, because plant breeding is not confined to any particular part of the world.  I wonder whether we would be advantaged or disadvantaged by being outside this bloc.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that it is much more difficult to obtain a patent for plant breeding than it is to obtain a patent in industry.  In his summing up, perhaps the Minister will let us know how it will be policed.  I understand there is great piracy in this business, that there is no shortage of copycats. I note also that it is extraordinarily difficult to keep track of varieties that are crossed again. I cannot say I understand the process but I understand that, in the case of back-crossing or genetic modification, a scientist or breeder could perfect a new variety which meets the criteria laid out in the Bill for obtaining a patent but that the scientist or breeder may not benefit, that his or her work would be hijacked.  The Bill is trying to ensure that this does not happen.  To every book its cover and to every cow its calf is the basis on which this Bill is drawn up; people who have the capability to invent a new variety will have their rights protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to section 19(1)(d) in the context of the potato industry.  If a farmer grows certified potatoes on an acreage greater than 15 acres, he has to pay a royalty.  If such a farmer holds on to the seed from the first year's production of certified <Col N="1506" /> potatoes and sows it on his farm the second year, does he have to pay royalties?  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he could tell us how much the royalties are.  I hope there will not be a secondary charge, but I thought the Minister said that the charges can be continued at farm level years after the first certified seed is sown.</P>
    <P>For a country as small as ours, we have a great plant breeding history.  We have produced wonderful potatoes.  The one with which most Irish people readily identify is the rooster variety which is one of the best potatoes ever invented here.  Consequent on this Bill, we must try to get the best varieties to suit our conditions, whether we are talking about white clover, perennial rye grass, sugar beet or cereals.  We have to ensure the maximum return because we are competing on a European stage with people who have those facilities.  I pay tribute to the scientists &mdash; mostly unsung and unheralded &mdash; involved in this area. It is a part of Irish agriculture on which few people get an opportunity to speak.  The information we get every year on cereals is a case in point.  It is very important to know what varieties did well and which were problematic, before farmers use them on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>Genetic engineering was mentioned.  I will not go into it because the Bill does not cover it, but what the Bill covers is close to it.  I have no hangups about genetic engineering but I worry about the excesses, and I never like to tamper with nature. However, it has good aspects.  The blight resistant potato has eluded scientists for many years.  They are not able to breed a potato that is resistant to blight.  It was done once or twice, but the potatoes were no good, producing very few tubers.  If we could produce a blight resistant potato, that would be a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me take up the points made by Deputy Connaughton in relation to the potato industry.  At Enniscrone House, Crossmolina in north Mayo, we were noted for our potatoes, and they are now setting potatoes for sale abroad.  I welcome that.</P>
      <P>I am glad that plant variety rights will be protected. I hope we can go further because in recent times we saw what multiple supermarkets could do in relation to the beef industry.  I hope Tesco will not do in the area of plants what they did in relation to beef and import produce from Britain and other countries into Ireland.  We already have people involved in this industry who do a fine job. I hope this Bill will protect them but, in respect of our vegetables and other plants, the multinational supermarkets will not get away with what they did in relation to beef.  The Department must monitor this industry on a regular basis.  Given the action it took in relation to Irish beef, I no longer trust Tesco.  I will table parliamentary questions to see if imports in this sector have increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton referred to royalties. However, we know from the music business the problems associated with collecting these.  In <Col N="1507" /> some cases those responsible for collecting royalties have adopted a heavy handed approach and threatened the owners of public houses with court action.  People who produced a new variety of potato or plant may want to patent it so that they will be paid royalties.  However, it is difficult to patent such products.  I hope this matter can be resolved and that the Bill will be easy to implement.</P>
    <P>Traders and shopkeepers should not be held accountable under the Bill.  We are all aware of the case involving a shopkeeper from Ballina who was taken to court for selling cigarettes to a young boy.  It is not easy to run a business.  One must pay tax, VAT and rates; one is effectively working for the State on a full time basis.  My family is involved in business and it is wrong that a businessman who pays his dues was set up by a State agency in this way.</P>
    <P>I have received many representations on genetic engineering.  Many people are concerned about this matter and more information must be made available on it.  Like Deputy Connaughton, I do not like to see nature tampered with.  As we have seen in many areas, if nature is tampered with it has a way of responding, sometimes in an unpleasant way.</P>
    <P>This is not the most exciting Bill brought before the House.  It is the only Bill on which I have not received representations.  Earlier this week I sought the views of the IFA and various breeders but there was not much interest in it. Deputies Connaughton and Coveney asked how many countries have signed up to this convention. We are great at implementing EU directives &mdash; sometimes we are too good at doing this &mdash; and I would like to know the number of countries which have implemented similar legislation.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage.  It is not the most exciting Bill but if it regulates the industry it is welcome.  I hope the Minister monitors the industry as it will ensure that those involved in it are treated fairly by the multinationals.  If problems similar to those in the beef industry arise the multinationals will have to be taken on.  We may have to call on the public to respond to this in a certain way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to raise with the Minister the possibility of growing vines on the banks of the Shannon.  They could be called Shannon valley vines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate Ireland's ratification of the 1991 UPOV Convention and the EU Council regulation setting up a Community plant variety rights system.  Such a system is vital to ensuring the proper exploitation of new varieties of plants which may have major economic or nutritional benefits for the consumer and, therefore, I welcome it.  However, I would like the Minister to clarify a few points which may be <Col N="1508" /> regarded as ambiguous, particularly in view of new technologies such as genetic engineering.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 14, which define the types of new varieties, need to be clarified.  Under these sections the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo; is used as a method for defining the characteristics of the variety and for declaring plant breeders' rights null and void. How is the word &ldquo;stability&rdquo; defined in the Bill? Section 14(3)(a) refers to stability after repeated propagation.  What is the Minister's definition of the term &ldquo;repeated propagation&ldquo;?</P>
    <P>I ask this question because there may be an alteration in the genetic make up of a genetically modified plant which may instil herbicide resistance but which does not change the plant.  Is it proposed to have 97 per cent or 100 per cent stability in the case of herbicide resistance?  According to the Darwinian theory, 100 per cent stability is not possible.  I would like this definition clarified as it has major implications for jumping genes where a gene moves from one plant to another.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to life cycles.  For example, a variety may be stable for five or ten life cycles but unstable after 50 life cycles.  Both these phrases need to be clearly defined so that we know exactly what they mean.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;distinctiveness&rdquo; under section 14(1)(b) also needs to be clarified.  This section states that the plant variety concerned must be clearly distinguishable from any other plant variety.  How is the term &ldquo;clearly distinguishable&rdquo; defined?  Are we talking about the genotypic or phenotypic plant variety or both?  It is important that this is defined as two plant varieties may look the same and produce the same product or fruit &mdash; the phenotypic expression &mdash; but they may be dissimilar in terms of genetic make up.</P>
    <P>I will again use the example of herbicide resistance which is a topical subject.  While two sugar beet varieties may produce the same product, genetically one may be resistant to a herbicide. This may have major implications from an economic point of view.  Will the legislation ensure that other breeders have access to such varieties? Clarification of this is vitally important in terms of section 9(1) under which a person refused authorisation by a breeder to use a plant variety which clearly has major consumer and-or producer benefits can be granted authorisation by the controller if he is satisfied it is in the public interest to do so.</P>
    <P>Clarification of these points will help to allay fears among consumers regarding genetic modification of plant varieties.  We have been irresponsible in not having a full and open debate on this matter.  Expert groups should be called before the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that the Legislature has the full facts regarding genetically modified organisms.  This would enable us to make an informed decision on issues which will come before the House in future years.  It is only when the Legislature and public are fully informed that we can tackle the serious <Col N="1509" /> problems caused by regulations which inhibit the development of this revolutionary technology.</P>
    <P>All those involved in biotechnology research fully subscribe to the need for the regulation of biotechnology, including GMOs.  During the early 1970s when the technology was being developed genetic engineering researchers voluntarily agreed to introduce their own controls.  We now have significant experience of GMOs and a clearer picture of their economic, environmental and health benefits.  Instead of imagining the disadvantages and dangers of GMOs, it is time Ireland and the rest of Europe recognised the opportunities and benefits they can provide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring spoke about tampering with nature. We are talking about genetic manipulation, not genetic tampering.  It is the manipulation of existing organisms.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring stated that man should not interfere with nature but man has interfered with nature since time began.  In developing new plants, man has always mixed species and varieties to come up with new products and better plants.  We are using genetics as a tool to do that.  With genetic manipulation we are only speeding up the process.</P>
    <P>Industries here are losing out financially and are disadvantaged economically because the EU has the most restrictive regulations in the world. We need a full, open and frank debate rather than scaremongering.  People do not have the basic facts.  Genetic engineering can be of major benefit to the public in increasing food safety and the quality of life.  It has even been suggested that Dolly, the famous sheep may have been of help in the health area and the techniques may be used in transplant operations.  This would be advantageous because, as the House will be aware, there is a shortage of available donor organs.</P>
    <P>We must give this new science a fair opportunity. We need a full and frank debate in this Chamber and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, where we can debate the issues with the expert groups from both sides.  Then we can come up with a realistic proposal instead of the scaremongering entered into by one organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the general trend of what Deputy Naughten said.  Obviously he has benefited from his background in science and I welcome the introduction of a little science to this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what was said about interfering with nature, certainly we should not do it lightly. However, we must recognise that it has been done since man moved on from being a huntergatherer. In essence, the agriculture and food industries are about interfering with nature. Medicine interferes with nature in a pretty grotesque manner.  Nobody here would suggest for a minute that giving people blood transfusions is natural, yet it is highly desirable.  Therefore, when terms like &ldquo;interfering with nature&rdquo; are used we need to think a little more about it.  I am not suggesting <Col N="1510" /> there should be gross or reckless interference with nature, but we must recognise that we do it all the time and there is wholesale support for it.  I doubt many people want to argue that we should abandon medicine or that man should return to being hunter-gatherers in the wild.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in as much as it caters for the development of new plant varieties, etc.  It is important that Ireland keeps pace with these developments in its legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is another response to an EU Directive. It protects the rights of breeders over a wide range of countries.  It is important that those who engage in scientific research have their rights and investments protected since the development of plant varieties is expensive and important.  The development of a new plant variety, as I understand it, takes about 20 years from the initial research to developing the new variety to the stage when it is used in commercial farming.  It is important that the Bill defines the concept of novelty, and I welcome that development.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the Bill will expand the potential offered to Irish plant breeders.  The number of people engaged in plant breeding in Ireland is small.  There have been between ten and 20 people engaged in it at any one time. Nevertheless, Irish plant breeders have made a significant contribution to the science.  In the 1930s and 1940s, when Irish agriculture was fairly primitive, significant progress was made in the area of plant breeding, largely due to the work of the late Professor Pat Carroll, giving rise to the Glasnevin varieties of plants which fulfilled a valuable function in those days.  In later times there has been the work of Teagasc and, indeed, the great success which Mr. Kehoe had with the new variety of potatoes which was developed in Oak Park, County Carlow.  There is also the fine work being conducted by the Department of Agriculture and Food in this area, where it has built up considerable expertise and where it provides a valuable service to people engaged in commercial agriculture by assessing new plant varieties coming on the market.  Such work must greatly help the industry in decisions on investment in these new varieties.</P>
    <P>The Bill will help to stimulate research in this area, which is important.  It will increase the rate at which new and better varieties come on the market, and that is a welcome development.  It will also help to increase the variety offered to consumers, and to reduce the cost of food.  It will improve the quality of food in as much as some of these products are less prone to disease and attack by pests.</P>
    <P>It is important in developing plant varieties that the concerns of consumers are taken into account, but that has not happened to the desired degree.  The main concerns taken into account were those of the farming industry.  I do not want to belittle their concerns and I know they translate into improved products for the consumer to some extent, but I would like to see greater attention <Col N="1511" /> given to the concerns of consumers and have it filter back into the plant breeding industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also welcome as it gives rise to a rare occasion on which the Houses of the Oireachtas discuss matters which relate to science and technology. This is very much the exception.  It is a pity we do not afford more attention to science and technology.  In many ways there is a great fear of science and technology and this is an aspect of life to which Deputy Naughten referred. This Bill deals with genetic engineering in the old fashioned way but it is still genetic engineering, the modification of the genetic composition of plants in an old fashioned and crude way.  There is no point deluding ourselves that this is not genetic engineering.  It is.  However, when it is done it is important that all concerns are taken into account.  It is important to have an adequate supply of information on genetic engineering, but we have not.  It is important to have appropriate controls and, as I understand it, they are not there. It is very important that there is proper assessment of the risks attached to genetic engineering, and science and technology generally.</P>
    <P>There is a huge fear of genetic engineering, yet those who are close to science would understand that this is the next big frontier to be crossed. There is a huge potential for good.  There is a huge opportunity.  We must go forward on that basis rather than turning our backs on science.</P>
    <P>Most factors relating to genetic engineering are driven from outside the country.  We have relatively little control except whatever influence we can exercise through the EU.  We certainly have very little control over what we can do here. Many developments are being driven by the US. Given its dominance in science and technology, it would be hard for us, regardless of what we do, to avoid the impact of these developments.  It is very important then that we set about understanding them and influencing their direction as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that an important conference on science and technology will be held next month which I understand is being organised by Professor David McConnell in Trinity College. It is unfortunate that it falls to somebody like Professor McConnell to take the initiative and organise this type of conference.  I would have thought those engaged in policy formation and development would be organising these conferences rather than leaving it to a scientist.  That should not be the case.  Parliament should be behind the development of understanding in these areas.</P>
    <P>Some of the realities in relation to what is taking place in genetics, and the implication of that for all of us, are chilling.  I understand we are not far from the day when it will be possible to say, having carried out a DNA analysis on an individual, that he or she will be a schizophrenic by the age of 30 or will suffer from Alzheimer's disease at 60.  The implications of that are mind-boggling, particularly for agencies such as the insurance <Col N="1512" /> industry because it works on the concept of risk. If all risk is eliminated, responsibility for problems that arise will fall back on the State.  The implications of these developments are enormous and it is a pity that the Irish chattering classes, those who lead opinion in Ireland, are not interested in these matters because inevitably they will visit us.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that some effort is not put into increasing public understanding of science and technology.  The key industries are science and technology based.  The food, farming, electronics and chemicals industries depend on science and technology, yet a large number of people do not make the connection between developments in those industries and the economic welfare of the country.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned that I wish to share my time with Deputy Gormley.</P>

One wonders at the mentality of a person who says they have stopped eating meat because they are afraid of contracting CJD, yet they smoke 60 cigarettes and drink ten or 12 whiskeys each day.  They are afraid of contracting CJD yet they are burning out their lungs and developing cirrhosis of the liver as they gulp down alcohol.  That is an enormous paradox and I wish those people in charge of disseminating information would make more of an effort to introduce an element of balance on these matters.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing his time.  This has developed into a debate on genetic engineering, which I welcome.  It is timely that we are discussing this important issue in the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Upton stated that Professor McConnell in TCD will soon hold a conference in the Point Depot, which is welcome, but until now a debate on this issue has not taken place in this House or in the public arena but in our courts because of the judicial review granted to Genetic Concern on foot of the Monsanto trials.</P>
      <P>I want to return to some of the points made by the previous speakers.  Deputy Naughten said that some of us are engaged in scaremongering.  That is a charge often levelled at the Green Party.  I have been called a scaremongerer for many years in relation to other issues.</P>

Pigs will fly when companies like Monsanto put people's health over profit.  That is what this is all about.  Genetic engineering is essentially driven by profit.</P>
      <P>A number of statements have been made about the fact that genetic engineering has continued for hundreds of years but they are inaccurate.  We are not talking about genetic engineering but traditional plant breeding which is known as hybridisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. This allows us to cross different varieties of fruit or vegetable from within the same family to produce strains with improved characteristics.  For example, we can have tomatoes which grow in colder climates.  That is a welcome development but with genetic engineering, scientists cross barriers between species so that, for instance, genes from a fish are put into a tomato to stop it freezing.  Genes taken from a virus, a bacteria or a flower are spliced into sugar beet to make them resistant to herbicide, which Deputy Naughten referred to.  Maize is being engineered so that its leaves produce a pesticide. We have to recognise that we are moving into a completely different area.</P>

      <P>There is a great deal of public concern about this and, for once, I am not in the minority on this important issue.  The Deputies who are clearly in favour of going ahead with genetic engineering talked about calculating the risk factor.  They are not calculating the risk factor because there have been instances in the past, and I referred to this when I called for an Adjournment debate on this issue, where companies like ICI and Dupont produced CFCs.  This was a cheap, safe product yet we now know it has caused enormous damage to the ozone layer. Recent reports indicate that using sunscreen is not sufficient protection, and instances of skin cancer have greatly increased, yet scientists said this product was absolutely safe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great concern throughout Europe about this issue.  Over one million Austrian citizens signed a petition calling on their Government to stop the release of genetically engineered organisms into food and the environment. Austria has banned the import of genetically engineered maize and has legally challenged the EU for sanctioning its use.  We should follow that direction.</P>
      <P>A Bill has been introduced in Brazil which would ban the planting, commercial growing and consumption of genetically engineered organisms and products anywhere in the country for two years.  Brazil has a unique opportunity of becoming the world's leading supplier of natural soya beans for which a large European market is forming. We know that market exists because a MORI poll commissioned by Greenpeace found that 59 per cent of Europeans are opposed to the development of genetically engineered foods. The poll was undertaken in Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK. Opposition in Sweden was as high as 76 per cent.</P>
      <P>There is grave public disquiet about this issue. A number of farmers who had intended to carry out these trials have backed out.  We must have a public debate on this issue so that parties can nail their colours to the mast.  In Opposition, Fianna Fáil had good policies in this area.  I would remind Deputy Davern of the statement by Deputy Dempsey, then Opposition spokesman on the environment, on 26 April last year in the run-up to an election:</P>
      <P>We are deeply concerned about the development and sale of genetically modified organisms whether they are used in agriculture, food or food processing.  It is our position that it is premature to release genetically modified organisms into the environment or to market foods which contain any genetically modified ingredients or where genetically modified organisms have been used in the production of the food.</P>
      <P>Current scientific knowledge is inadequate to protect the consumer and the environment from the unpredictable and potentially disastrous effects which may appear immediately or at any time in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Davern, should clarify whether that is still Fianna Fáil's position.  Deputy Dempsey went on to say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will not support what amounts to the largest nutritional experiment in human history with the consumer as guinea pig&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a responsibility to the people who are genuinely concerned about genetic engineering. <Col N="1515" /> It is not good enough at the time of an election to pull the wool over people's eyes by making such statements.  There must be substance behind them.  To make such statements was a cynical exercise because since coming to office the Government has not been very concerned about this matter.  Genetic Concern requested a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, to discuss this vital issue with him, but while he was happy to meet that body when in Opposition, he will not meet it now.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave a commitment that the Government will produce a policy document on genetic engineering, which will be published towards the end of March.  I welcome that, but the Food Safety Authority has no real powers in this area and we are awaiting a Bill in that regard. The Food Safety Authority was set up two years ago because of the problem with BSE, which was referred to by Deputy Upton.  One member of the Authority, Darina Allen, has said she is very concerned about developments in genetic engineering and about the Monsanto trials.  Her views should be taken on board.  The Food Safety Authority said that there is no evidence to show that genetic engineering is dangerous, but neither is there evidence to show it is safe.  We must adopt the precautionary principle &mdash; if one is not sure of the consequences, one must progress very slowly.  We owe it to the public to do that.</P>
    <P>Monsanto is a company with a very poor record and with a credibility problem.  It said it has a good record in regard to safety, but that is not the case.  There have been difficulties, for example, in regard to rape seed.  The company had to withdraw 60,000 bags of rape seed last year because of the emergence of an unexpected and unauthorised gene.  Its cotton crops have twice failed to perform as expected.  This is a huge company which is desperate to get its products on the market because of the profit motive.  In regard to research, the company was asked to conduct trials on dioxin, the most carcinogenic substance known, but it doctored the results.  That is clearly documented by Genetic Concern.</P>
    <P>We must be extremely vigilant and cautious in regard to this matter.  I look forward to a debate in the House when the policy document is laid before us and the various parties can then decide their policies.  I listened to Deputy Connaughton this morning who seemed to take a different view from that of Deputy Naughten.  Deputy Connaughton referred to the issue of potatoes.  On the question of diversity, Genetic Concern stated:</P>
    <P>The wide variety of seeds currently grown have different levels of resistance to pests, viruses and changes in climate.  Genetech seeds would replace the vast pool of traditional varieties with a more vulnerable single strain.  This could result in diseases such as potato blight having disastrous effects on food supply.  We in Ireland should know better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>The protection of plants and foodstuffs may be compared to copyright in another sphere.  It is imperative that we consider the overall development of various foodstuffs, plants and seeds coming on the market.  We are all concerned about Monsanto and its proposed trials. In that context certain trials should be allowed which would be fully controlled.  We could then come to a conclusive decision on the matter.  I do not agree with what that company is doing, but it has the right to carry out trials.</P>
      <P>This Bill was introduced mainly to allow Ireland to ratify EU regulations setting up a plant variety protection system.  We should look at some of the developments that have taken place here in the past ten or 15 years, for example, in breeding new varieties of potatoes, some of which have been very successful.  The Department of Agriculture and Food is to be praised for its work in that regard.  It has helped the potato industry, but the full benefits have not accrued in terms of international sales of some of those species.</P>
      <P>While this may not be the proper place to do so, we must consider this matter from the point of view of herbicide use and its effect on plants. There should be tight control on the use of herbicides. People are concerned that products coming into this country which may have been sprayed with organo-phosphorus sprays will have an effect on their health.</P>
      <P>This is a technical Bill which will be of more interest to technocrats and lawyers than politicians because they will want to protect the interests of people who develop different varieties of plants and seeds.  It is imperative that assistance and protection is given to developers. It is unacceptable that a person who produces a superior product would not get the full benefit of it.  In the industrial field there are copyrights and patent rights, but in this case there are limited rights in terms of protection.  If a developer has made a large investment, it is possible that someone could steal their development at the last minute and they would have few rights in terms of obtaining restitution.</P>
      <P>Plant breeders are affected by the origin and source of various plant varieties.  In the past, litigation procedures were instigated in respect of the production of the best variety of roses.  This might seem amusing but litigation procedures arose in the UK when a person claimed that a variety of rose they developed had been stolen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Bill is enacted I hope we will be able to protect and encourage plant breeding in Ireland.  That is imperative for the future development of the agricultural scene.  There is scope to encourage plant breeding and profits to be gained from it.  We should not leave development of plant varieties to major companies with large resources to reinvest.  We should put in place mechanisms to encourage the development <Col N="1517" /> of plant varieties.  Perhaps venture capital funding could be provided for this type of work.</P>
    <P>It is important that members of the public should be made aware of the contents of the Bill. I accept it will be passed by the House without great debate.  However, it is imperative that the various organisations involved make the general public aware of the Bill's provisions and what they can achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members who contributed to the debate, which may have gone slightly off track.  This Bill is concerned with the rights of individuals &mdash; a fact to which the Green Party does not seem to have given consideration &mdash; in respect of claiming ownership of and gaining royalties from plant varieties.  I believe it was inappropriate for the Green Party to react in that way.  I thank those who asked questions and I will do my best to answer them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Naughten inquired about varieties which are clearly distinguishable.  This is a difficult concept but it is outlined in the legislation. Using modern techniques, varieties can be identified at the level of genotype and phenotype.</P>
      <P>Deputies Coveney and Connaughton raised the issue of royalties.  The pattern of royalty payments is determined by market forces and neither the controller nor the Minister have any role in fixing the level of royalties.  It is the responsibility of the breeder to decide the level at which royalties are set.</P>
      <P>Deputies Coveney and Ring inquired about the action taken by other states.  There are 35 members of the UPOV, the majority of which have signed or are currently developing legislation to ratify the 1991 convention.  Under GATT agreements, all member states of the WTO will, by 1999, be obliged to put in place a <i>sui generis</i> system for plant varieties.  There will have to be worldwide compliance with these systems.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring inquired about a shopkeeper selling cigarettes to a child and whether this could be considered legal because tobacco is a plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he was referring to commercial tobacco.  Anyone who sells cigarettes to children should be prosecuted.  No one, regardless of whether they are constituents of Deputy Ring, should be defended in that light.  It will be the responsibility of the shopkeeper or trader to advise the holder from where the harvested material being sold was obtained.  That information is clearly stated on packets of cigarettes and I hope it will be clearly stated on other products to make life easier for retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Naughten raised the lack of stability. The technical examination of the variety will be determined if the variety meets the criteria on <Col N="1518" /> distinctiveness, stability and uniformity.  If a variety is found to be unstable at growing trials, the rights are then revoked or cancelled.  Varieties would die a natural death if they were found to be unstable or unsuitable.  I intend no personal slight to the Green Party or the generic views of its members in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in a moment.  Deputy Connaughton inquired about the use of farm saved seed.  A farmer who saves potatoes, for which plant breeding rights exist, from a previous year's planting will have to pay compensation if his production area exceeds 6.3 hectares, which equates to 150 metric tonnes of ware potatoes.</P>
      <P>With regard to genetically modified organisms, I accept that people are rightly concerned about this matter which should be discussed openly. However, I do not agree with the fanaticism expressed in certain statements on this matter. For example, a member of the Green Party recently called me a fascist.  I do not hold with fascism, if I believe in any &ldquo;ism&rdquo; it is one which begins with the letter &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The statement to which the Deputy refers says that we are deeply concerned. Everyone is anxious that these matters should be discussed and investigated in full.  However, as Deputy Ellis inquired, why should we not allow experiments with proper protection mechanisms to proceed?</P>
      <P>The damage done by certain individuals who destroyed plants in County Carlow last year strikes me as another form of fascism.  People who oppose field sports have also done damage. It is extraordinary that those who oppose coursing place broken glass on the same track on which dogs will be running.  I was sorry to see that there was some level of support among Green Party members for this behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the regulation of genetically modified organisms in Ireland.  Council Directive 90/219/EEC lays down common measures for the contained use and research in industrial facilities of genetically modified microorganisms. Council Directive 90/220/EEC covers the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms for experimental purposes and for placing products on the market. Those directives were transposed into Irish law under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations 1994-7.  Before genetically modified organisms can be released into the environment for research and development, namely, field trials, the competent authority must give its consent when it has studied the technical description of the proposed release, evaluated the risks involved and the impact it will have on human health and the environment and considered representations made in respect of the proposed release.</P>
      <P>The procedures to be followed for placing GMOs on the market in the EU involve the submission of a notification and a detailed technical dossier to a competent authority.  The competent authority is responsible for carrying out the main environmental risk assessment in relation to humans, plants, animals and the environment and must make its decision within 90 days.</P>
      <P>In the case of a favourable opinion by the authority to authorise the placing of the GMO on the market the application is forwarded to the EU Commission and the competent authorities of other member states with a favourable opinion for consent.  In the event that an objection to consent being given is made by any member state, the Commission must table a proposal for a decision before the Committee on the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms to the Environment and consent can be given by qualified majority.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the only issue to be considered in relation to the application of a plant bidder's rights for a GMO variety is whether the variety satisfies the criteria for granting such rights, namely, whether the variety is novel, distinct, uniform and stable and whether it has suitable denomination.</P>
      <P>Dutch elm disease wiped out elm trees. Research trials have given rise to a tree which is resistant to the disease.  That has been achieved through research by people who care.  I did not want a generation to grow up without seeing an elm tree.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will get a copy in due course.</P>
      <P>Company Law provides for the incorporation and registration of companies.  The main statutory provisions are contained in the Companies Act, 1963.  The Act has been amended on a number of occasions, most recently by the Companies Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>In addition, regulations made under the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended, have implemented various European Union company law directives and regulations designed to harmonise company law within the EU.  Approximately 156,000 companies are registered in the Companies Registration Office.  We have no definite information as to how many of these companies are treated for tax purposes as non-resident and, thereby, fall into the category of IRNR. Various estimates have been given, including the 40,000 used by the Deputy in her question.  Every company registered in the Companies Registration Office has to submit an annual return to the office.  Appended to this return is a copy of the company's accounts, but in the case of companies which meet the criteria of small and medium sized, the accounts are less detailed than for larger companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to place on the record that the company law regime in operation has been harmonised to the level provided for in EU directives, and in some instances goes beyond basic EU requirements.  Information available to the Department is that an ever increasing number of <Col N="1523" /> IRNRs are being set up, but are not active in Ireland.  Accordingly, these companies do not pay Irish tax.  It is understood some companies have been found to engage in undesirable activities worldwide, such as fraud, money laundering and other illegal activities.  It will be appreciated, therefore, that these companies, because they are Irish registered, reflect badly on the reputation of Ireland.  More particularly, they are perceived as being regulated in the same manner as companies operating from the IFSC but this is not, of course, the case.  Nevertheless, the perception seriously damages the reputation of the IFSC as a centre where reputable companies are properly regulated.</P>
    <P>Various attempts have been made to address the problems created by IRNRs.  Section 58 of the Finance Act, 1995, amended section 141 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976.  The amendment was designed to enable the Revenue authorities to seek specific information from parties who were incorporating companies which were subsequently being operated as non-resident companies. It enabled them to seek the disclosure of certain information about the people who had control or ownership of the companies in question. For various reasons, the section has not been as effective as might have been hoped.</P>
    <P>In June 1997 a renewed impetus was given to the search for a solution to address the problems created by IRNRs.  A sub-committee of the IFSC Banking and Treasury Group, which is one of a number of groups under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach which exists to co-ordinate the policy and regulatory matters relating to the ongoing development of the IFSC, was set up to develop proposals that would address the problem. The sub-committee is still in existence and meeting on a regular basis seeking solutions.</P>
    <P>Concurrent with the IFSC sub-committee an inter branch/agency committee was established within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in mid-December 1997, with a view to reaching consensus on the proposals under consideration in the tax and company law areas. Equally, that committee is still in existence and seeks to develop solutions to the problem.</P>
    <P>Against the background outlined, it will be seen that the focus of Deputy McManus's question was whether the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment had any proposals for improvement to the procedures for registration and monitoring of companies and if she would make a statement on the matter.  The reply, which I gave, is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government is acutely aware of the problems that some Irish registered non-resident companies are giving rise to and of the urgent need to put measures in place to address these problems.  An IFSC working group made up of representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, my own Department, Revenue, Central Bank, the IDA and some private sector interests who are members of the IFSC <Col N="1524" /> Banking and Treasury Committee has been actively considering proposals over a wide area in an effort to come up with workable solutions to what is a difficult and complex issue.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals being considered are some in the company law area put forward by my Department, which is being assisted in its deliberations by Forfás, IDA and Forbairt. While I am not in a position to give details of possible legislation at this stage the broad thrust of whatever action is taken in the company law area will be aimed at a tightening up of the registration process consistent with avoiding the imposition of undue cost and administrative burdens on business at large.  A key challenge therefore will be the achievement of a proper balance in this area.  The Government will respond swiftly to any reasonable proposals emerging.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Companies Registration Office which has been allocated additional resources in the past 12 months is now in a much better position to monitor compliance of companies with existing company law requirements as regards the making of annual returns and such like and to respond more effectively and speedily where non-compliance is occurring.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that the response acknowledged the Government is acutely aware of the problems created by some IRNR companies and that work is being done to see how they can be addressed.  However, as indicated in the reply, the work has not reached the stage where it is possible to disclose what proposals will be brought forward, but it states the broad thrust of whatever action is taken in the company law area will be aimed at a tightening up of the registration process consistent with avoiding the imposition of undue cost and administrative burdens on business at large.</P>
    <P>The issues raised by IRNR companies had been the subject of substantial public coverage in the media in the days prior to the answer of the question.  In particular, I refer to articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 6 and 13 February 1998.  A great deal of information about IRNRs is already in the public domain.</P>
    <P>I came into office only in October 1997 and the matter came to my attention in November.  An interdepartmental committee was established in December as a result of a decision I made.  This shows the matter was dealt with immediately and we intend to take an effective decision on the matter to rectify the situation as quickly, responsibly and positively as possible.</P>

      <P>The issues involved in this emergency debate can be addressed in two ways.  Why did the Tánaiste not give the information she had in the note in reply to the question?  There was nothing in it that she could not have included in the reply.  The question specifically referred to concerns about these companies using this country for tax evasion or to hide money derived from criminal activity.  It is not as if the question did not refer to that matter.  It is clear from the note, inadvertently issued with the reply, that the Tánaiste was privy to the information that there is grave concern about the use of these companies and that they are being confused with properly regulated and registered IFSC companies.  A clear warning was given to her in that note that the actions of these companies was giving rise to concern. The note stated:</P>
      <P>The fact that they are Irish registered reflects badly on the reputation of Ireland.  More particularly, they are perceived as being regulated in the same way as companies operating from the IFSC which, of course, they are not, but this perception seriously damages the reputation of the IFSC as a centre where reputable companies are properly regulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Progressive Democrats were formed, the Minister pilloried us, from the Opposition benches, for not giving full information to the House.  I was at the receiving end of an attack from her when she was on the Opposition benches because less than 12 hours &mdash; certainly less than three to four working hours &mdash; after a major robbery had taken place she expected me to come <Col N="1526" /> into the House with the crime fully investigated and put the facts before the House.  She wanted me to name the offenders, the sentences they received and so on.  She gave no mercy if she felt Ministers gave the House less than the full information she thought they might have.</P>
    <P>The shoe is on the other foot now and she must now face up to the reality.  It is not good enough to give the House this type of answer to a question when she has other information available to her, as we know she had from the note.  She owes the Dáil and Deputy McManus an apology.  I hope when she speaks this afternoon she will not continue with her gung ho attack on the Opposition for daring to criticise her for not giving the information.  Even a first year English student would be able to detect the difference between the reply and the note.  She was less than open in her reply.  It is not good enough for her to say she would have given the information on the note if she were asked supplementary questions.  She should also know from experience that Question No. 101 was unlikely to be reached by way of oral question and that, therefore, she would not have been able to give the information on the note in answer to supplementaries.  Her defence in that line is very weak.</P>
    <P>The other issue we must tackle today is the substance of the note.  There is no doubt serious concern exists in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and in the Department of Finance about the issue of non-resident registered companies.  Obviously, this system has existed for many years and was used mainly by companies who operated here, contributed to the economy and used those accounts to carry on work elsewhere where tax was paid on the money involved.  In recent years, however, there has been a move to set up companies that do not trade or have a tax liability here.  Yet, the Minister gave a slightly laid back answer to a question about this matter as if it is a problem, but not an urgent one.  People are concerned about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister could be forgiven if she and the Minister for Finance had not recently gone to Brussels to sort out our rate of corporation tax with the Commission.  When the programme for Government was prepared by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats they pilloried the last Government for talking about a 12.5 per cent rate and promised a 10 per cent rate.  They said this was possible and that our Government was wrong.  They went to Brussels where the debate centred around the fact that some of our EU partners were concerned that there were special regimes here that were giving rise to favouritism and causing inward investment that other countries could not attract.  The Minister need not tell me that she or the Minister for Finance, who is in charge of the Revenue Commissioners, would not have been briefed by their respective Departments about the widespread concern about this matter, which was reflected in the note to the Minister.  This is merely another instance of the <Col N="1527" /> Minister's actions.  When the closure of Seagate was announced she expressed surprise even though she had known for three months that there were serious concerns about the company's future.  She is again trying to imply that she did not know about the concerns being expressed at European level and by her Department, as evidenced in the note, about non-resident companies. I do not accept her contention this morning on the radio that she or the Minister of State were handling the matter and that it would be dealt with in the fullness of time.  She did not give the House the full information that was available to her.  I accept the attachment of the memo was an error by some staff member.  Obviously, it should not have been attached to the reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a mistake, but like it or not, the Minister is responsible for her Department. She must take responsibility for the fact that somebody in her Department attached the memo to the reply and it is now public knowledge.  We are now able to judge the Minister on the way she handles matters in her Department and she must face up to that because of the way she judged us when we were in Government.  She was quick enough to blame other Ministers when she was in Opposition if something happened in their Departments.  I recall her stating from the bench where Deputy McDowell is now sitting that I was responsible for everything that happened in my Department.  She is responsible for the mistake in making this document public, but that is not really the issue.  She is responsible for clearing her parliamentary questions and making sure information available to her in note form is transmitted into replies.</P>
      <P>In less than two months, on 21 April I think, the freedom of information legislation will become law.  One would have imagined, therefore, that the Minister would be fully conscious of learning how to make information available, even if it is the tradition of Departments to give out information on a need-to-know basis.  In less than two months, by law, her Department will have to give information and I trust it is already practising how to do that.  If not, the fault lies with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Financial Services Centre, founded ten years ago, has been a great boost to the country. It has created in excess of 3,500 jobs and is fully regulated under EU regulations.  When my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, was Minister of State he published a report titled, A Report of the International Advisory Group on the International Financial Services Centre.  It is obvious from that report that we can be proud of the centre. It is recognised as a regulated centre for financial services in the EU, subject to the agreed disciplines embodied in EU Directives.  I want to get across the message that the Minister for <Col N="1528" /> Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance have an obligation to ensure that nothing exists that will damage the reputation and the regulation of the IFSC.  It is clear from the report that the existence of the IRNRs are causing some threat to that reputation.  When she and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy went to Brussels I have no doubt the matter was discussed.  The lack of frankness and openness in her reply is even more damaging to her.  I await with interest to see how she will tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>Long discussions have taken place in Brussels on the 12.5 per cent corporation tax.  One of the key criticisms about Ireland from the EU and other members was they were under the mistaken impression that these non-resident companies were part of the IFSC.  However, I am sure the two relevant Ministers made it clear to the EU Commission and their partners that the IRNRs were not part of the regulated IFSC.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Taoiseach today did not seem to know what was going on.  For example, when Deputy John Bruton asked about the situation regarding the financial action task force on money laundering, a subcommittee of the OECD, of which Ireland is a member, it appeared there was no knowledge of it although we have been able to draw this down off the Internet since that debate.  They did not appear to know Ireland was a member and there was a request as to what Deputy John Bruton was talking about.</P>
    <P>Are the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance aware of the role Ireland plays in various international bodies such as this?  The financial action task force, FATF, produced a report on money laundering and under the Belgian Presidency its work was to continue. What has Ireland done about this since 1 July?  There seems to be no knowledge in the Department about this work and what is expected.  How many of the 40 recommendations have been implemented here?</P>
    <P>It is clear the Minister has been caught offside on this issue.  She owes it to this House and, more importantly, to the reputation of this country to rectify the misleading impression given and to get the report which was produced in June.  We cannot wait another six months or a year for that report because our reputation is at stake.  I hope the Minister will recognise, given the anger at the lack of frankness, that we need a proper reply. The reply of the Minister of State today did not explain why the Minister's reply was not frank and open.  I notice the Minister is trying to put the blame on the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, which is not fair as Deputy Harney is the senior Minister.  When I was Minister in a Department I was briefed on all the parliamentary questions before coming into this House.  If a Minister of State was taking questions he or she was also briefed.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, is responsible for how she answers to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank Act needs to be updated in regard to any trust set up here.  We must know <Col N="1529" /> the proper regulations are in place to ensure it is not used to hide dirty money, drug money, Russian Mafia money or any other foreign money which may have been gained through criminal or tax evasion methods.  The Government does not recognise that by one act we could lose our positive reputation for the Irish Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at how unaware the Minister is of the danger about this information and that she was not upfront with it.  I await her reply with interest.  It is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to explain the reason the Minister misled the Dáil and was not frank and open, given that she, as a member of the Progressive Democrats, had lectured us year in year out.  She must now be judged by the standards she set for everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two issues before the House: the question of Irish registered non-resident companies and the question of political accountability arising from the way this matter was dealt with by the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.  I shall deal with the second issue first.  Deputy McManus asked a question comprising several parts.  She asked if the Tánaiste was aware of the problem created by the use &mdash; or rather the abuse &mdash; of IRNRs and what proposals the Tánaiste had to deal with the difficulties arising out of that use or misuse.  The response was succinct to the point of being meaningless. It acknowledged merely that the Government was &ldquo;acutely aware&rdquo; of the problems.  The Minister was in possession of information which represents nothing less than a damning indictment of IRNRs and the way in which they were used.</P>
      <P>The supplementary information in the Minister's possession dealt with allegations of criminal and illegal activity, money laundering &mdash; an activity damaging to Ireland's reputation abroad and damaging to the reputation of the IFSC.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand the reason the Tánaiste found it impossible to acknowledge the genuine nature of these concerns.  Why did she not acknowledge the real nature of the problem? Did she consider that this House is not entitled to know that a particular company law structure is being used to help or assist in activities which are illegal and damaging to Ireland's reputation? Does she or the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, believe it is sufficient to say they are &ldquo;acutely aware&rdquo; of the problem without giving any detail in relation to the nature of the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the Tánaiste's reticence is clear. By providing an anodyne reply she presumably expected the question and the answer would go unnoticed by the press and the public and that she and her Department and other Departments of State would be allowed to deal with the matter secretly and quietly.  Generally speaking this is typical of the way in which we do things &mdash; do not scare the horses, do not acknowledge the nature <Col N="1530" /> of the problem because the public do not need to know.</P>
    <P>The culture of secrecy is deeply imbued in our public service system.  Matters such as this are dealt with by interdepartmental committees, high level task forces and committees.  Inasmuch as it can be done in private, that is the way to do it. This comes as no surprise to any of us, what is surprising is that the Tánaiste and her party should so meekly accept this culture of secrecy. For many years the Minister, Deputy Harney, and others trumpeted the need for transparency and accountability in the way we do the public's business.  We are now being asked by the Tánaiste to accept that all the public is entitled to know about a serious problem is that the Government is &ldquo;acutely aware&rdquo; of it.  This is not acceptable, the public is entitled to know and is entitled to expect we will do something about it.</P>
    <P>The second part of Deputy McManus's question was about the proposals the Tánaiste may have to deal with IRNRs.  On this question the Minister's response was even more mute.  The official response it was intended to give to the Dáil merely confirms that her Department and others were looking at proposals.  She specifically said she does not intend to give details of the proposals and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, repeated that.</P>
    <P>The detailed response in the Minister's back-up information clearly indicates the nature of such proposals.  When the Minister came into the House she knew proposals existed, and are being discussed, to deal with IRNRs.  Yet he or she deliberately chose to hide the nature of these proposals from the House.  These proposals were essentially threefold.  We were informed the Department of Finance was considering a tax based solution, that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment was considering a company law solution and that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was asked to look at an additional provision regarding money laundering.</P>
    <P>Why was the Dáil not told about this?  Why are we not upfront about these matters?  I do not see what damage could have been done if the Minister had indicated the nature of the proposals being considered.  What did he expect would happen? Did we expect these companies would vanish overnight?  Perhaps some would have vanished and perhaps others involved in illegal activities might have departed these shores and taken their bank accounts elsewhere.  If so good riddance to them.  The likelihood is, without wishing to prejudice anything the Garda may do, that we will not be able to successfully mount a prosecution against these companies so why have them here in the first place?</P>
    <P>I refer to IRNRs and the damage they are doing to our reputation and to the reputation of the IFSC.  I do not believe there is a single convincing reason for offshore non-resident accounts and non-resident companies of this kind. Although these companies may not trade here, <Col N="1531" /> one can be sure they maintain bank accounts here.  That is one of the primary reasons this company law structure exists.</P>
    <P>This problem has not arisen today, last year or the year before last.  As I understand it, this structure has been available for use since the mid-1970s. For most of that period it has had a benign presence.  As we are all aware, the difficulty has arisen since 1989 when Britain closed off this loophole.  Since then, particularly in Eastern Europe following the fall of communism and the demolition of the Berlin Wall, Ireland has been touted as a location where this type of company structure exists.  This is not being done for reasons we should seek to uphold.  It is clear from the Minister of State's response that it is being used, at least partly, for illegal and money laundering activities.  We cannot stand over this.</P>
    <P>There is no legitimate reason for the existence of these companies.  No other country in the European Union currently has a company law structure of this kind.  As I understand it, Britain was the last to close off what is seen, at best, as a loophole.  It is an undesirable structure.  We should move to ensure these companies fold.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made in the past 24 hours that multinational corporations locating here use these companies for legitimate reasons. They may use them for reasons that are legal and, to that extent, proper but I remain to be convinced that we should facilitate them in using them in this way.  This country offers decent tax concessions to multinational corporations.  There are many reasons they should seek to locate here. We have a young, well trained, English speaking workforce which is of huge benefit to multinational corporations.  It is of benefit to American based multinational corporations that they can gain a foothold in the EU market by locating here.  I do not see why we should seek to facilitate them further by providing a company law structure which allows them to avoid or defer the payment of tax in their home country, in many cases, the United States of America.  If the IDA believes this, it has a job to do to persuade me and my party that we should seek to facilitate them in that way.  There is little or no benefit to the economy in having this company law structure available. As Deputy Owen said, there are huge drawbacks.</P>
    <P>It would be wide of the mark to attribute responsibility for what is happening to the Government; the problem has been growing over the past seven or eight years and it is one we must tackle as it is inflicting serious damage on our reputation.  As we are all aware, many of our European Union partners look upon Ireland as a second Cayman Islands.  They are, to say the least, not impressed by our perfectly legal and proper efforts to attract foreign direct investment. They look askance at this company law structure. They are right to do so.  We should move to clean up our act.  We should do so by making this kind of company useless to the people who wish to use <Col N="1532" /> it for tax avoidance purposes or other illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I await the Tánaiste's response on the issue of responsibility.  She has serious questions to answer.  The unfortunate civil servants who have contributed to this déba cle may, in a sense, have done us a favour.  They have pointed yet again to the way in which our public service works and the way in which we grasp for secrecy as much as we can.  They may have made it less likely that something like this will happen again.</P>

      <P>The manner in which the Government has reacted to the disclosures I made yesterday about the extent of knowledge in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment of the problems associated with the operation of Irish registered non-resident companies and the manner in which this information was withheld from the House have been characterised by a degree of indecision, obfuscation and buck passing that we have not witnessed for a long time.  One would be tempted to use the term &ldquo;rudderless ship&rdquo; but that would convey a degree of stability and direction which is missing from the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Administration. We have witnessed the Tánaiste trying to blame the Minister of State; the Minister of State trying to blame everyone else; the Taoiseach clearly embarrassed by the incompetence of his Ministers; last minute changes to the Order of Business without the normal courtesy of informing the Opposition; an inability to decide how the problem of Irish registered non-resident companies should be dealt with, and an indisputable decision by the Minister to withhold relevant and substantive information in reply to the question tabled by my colleague, Deputy McManus.</P>
      <P>There are two issues involved, the first of which is the phenomenon of Irish registered non-resident companies, the extent to which this is increasing in recent years, the damage it is inflicting on the reputation of Ireland and the IFSC in particular.  I agree with my colleagues who have drawn attention to the success of the IFSC and the need to distinguish between multinational corporations, and branches thereof located here, engaged in legitimate international commerce and fly-by-night companies which seek an Irish domicile for the express purpose of evading tax in their country of origin.</P>
      <P>The second question relates to the concealment of information in reply to the question tabled by Deputy McManus which was straightforward and specific.  It asked the number of companies involved in criminality and so on.  It was not addressed, not because the Department did not have certain information and the Minister was not briefed but because someone decided not to make the information available.  This raises profound questions about the efficacy of the parliamentary question and the accountability of Ministers to Parliament.</P>

That is a falsehood.  I challenged him this morning to deal with the matter and to apologise but he did neither.  I am surprised that he does not, at least, have the guts to say that, when he could not think of anything else to say last night, he blurted this out.

      <P>Various Ministers and Government sources have attempted to divert attention from the manifest concealment of relevant substantive information in reply to a parliamentary question by making wide-ranging and unfounded allegations in respect of my tenure as Minister of State with responsibility for commerce.  It is a falsehood for the Minister of State to allege that &ldquo;there was a file on this issue left unattended for three years&rdquo; when I was Minister of State.  There were no proposals for action on IRNRs, legislative or otherwise, brought to me.  There was no knowledge, and according to the Minister's briefing note last week, there is still no knowledge of the scale of this phenomenon.  Prior to my leaving <Col N="1534" /> office I have a vague recollection of it being brought to my attention that Department of Finance proposals were being contemplated but that they could not and should not be supported by the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Last week's internal memorandum is consistent with that and indicates the working group being established &ldquo;in the middle of last year&rdquo; and the Department of Justice now indicating that they too &ldquo;see problems with these proposals&rdquo;.  That is in keeping with the script of the Minister of State. He spoke about a subcommittee of the Irish Financial Services Centre and the treasury group being set up in June 1997 under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, which had nothing to do with me.  That was a decision of the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was also wrong in his statement this morning on the Order of Business that as commerce Minister I should have been aware of the Ryanair prospectus and should have asked questions about the sweetheart deal concluded by the company with the then Minister, Maire Geoghegan-Quinn.  There was no question of a prospectus prepared for American investors for an Nasdaq flotation being brought to the attention of the Irish commerce Minister or his approval being sought.  The Taoiseach's intervention to that effect is a further red herring to add to the shoal put about by the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.</P>
      <P>Regarding my legislative record over two and a half years as Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce, I put seven Bills through the Oireachtas, some of which were major legislation. They include the Credit Union Act, the Consumer Credit Act, the Trademarks Act, the Takeover Panel Stock Exchange Act, the Legal Metrology Act, the Casual Trading Act and the NSAI Act.  That legislative record does not include different regulations and statutory instruments. It is a legislative record of which I am immensely proud and in respect of a body of legislative achievement is second only to the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  I also had at an advanced stage of preparation a companies (amendment) Bill providing for changes in the law relating to examinership, small firm audit and tackling the so-called phoenix syndrome.  No previous Minister of State with responsibility for Commerce has put so much legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>In addition, and immediately pertinent to this controversy, I took the Companies Registration Office out of the doldrums and put through a major reform package that included an extensive new premises at Parnell House and sanction for 60 additional staff and for £1.1 million investment in information technology.  I discovered the Companies Registration Office had been neglected for years, was under-resourced and was in entirely unsuitable accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, returns to us, I would like to remind her that her party, in <Col N="1535" /> the form of the then Deputy Michael McDowell, harried me in the House to privatise the Companies Registration Office because it was not functioning up to standard.  However, that was no reflection on the staff.  The office had been under-resourced for years.  It was in a warren at the bottom of Dublin Castle that was utterly unsuitable for staff.  It did not have the necessary technology and no Minister in the previous 15 years seemed to have taken an interest in it.  The then Deputy McDowell wanted me to privatise it.  I did not do that, but the memorandum I brought to Cabinet included a provision for the recruitment of an outside chief executive.  To my amazement as a result of this controversy I find that the leader of all the privatisers, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, has changed that decision and a Civil Service appointment has been made.  I would like to hear her address that matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of the manner in which Ministers account to this House, I remind the Tánaiste that when her colleague, the Taoiseach, was dealing with this matter on 24 May 1995 he stated:</P>
    <P>It is totally unsatisfactory for the Taoiseach to say on the national airwaves this morning that the reason he did not give us a full account here in the House yesterday was because he was not asked the right question.  The implications of that are horrendous for any Taoiseach. The Taoiseach is implying that if we do not ask the right questions he will feel free to conceal any information he deems proper from this House.  How on earth are we on the Opposition benches to know on a daily basis what the right question is to elicit information in the public interest..  This is a disgraceful way to treat the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy McManus knew the right question.  She asked the pertinent question, but the Minister in that full state of knowledge chose not to answer it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen dealt with the business of the metamorphosis that has taken place in the Tánaiste since the winds of indignation were billowing her over here on these benches.  She has a totally different approach to parliamentary life and accountability.  Her performance on radio this morning had to be heard to be believed. Apart from presumably a phone call from the Taoiseach to try to give the Minister of State a pat on the head, which strikes me to be the kiss of death&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apart from that, she claimed she could not see any difference between the backup documentation and the answer to the parliamentary question.  That defies belief.  It has been dealt with by independent commentators to some extent and I am sure it will be dealt with further <Col N="1536" /> by them.  That reply to the question did not deal with what number of those companies are here, the fact that the Department is so concerned that some of them have a proven track record of involvement in illegal activity, fraud and money laundering, that they are making no contribution to this economy, paying no tax, damaging our international reputation, damaging the reputation of the IFSC and that it is a growing phenomenon in recent years.  Yet the Minister, Deputy Harney, could tell the country this morning that she could see no discrepancy between the reply she gave in the House and the information circulated.  She went on brazen-faced to read out the first of two sentences under paragraph 8 of the confidential memorandum entitled &ldquo;Confidentiality Proposals&rdquo;. She read: &ldquo;While references have been made in the recent media coverage to solutions being sought in the tax and company law area no specific details have emerged.&rdquo; However, she did not read the second sentence which states: &ldquo;It is strongly recommended that this approach be maintained in so far as the reply to the PQ is concerned.&rdquo; That is the critical point.  That shows there was intention to conceal.  She sets up a man of straw by accusing me of accusing her of misleading the House.  I never did that.  I accused her of concealing information and I repeat that charge now.</P>
      <P>In terms of all this hokey-pokey and concealment, the Tánaiste's attitude to dealing with scandals that have broken is in stark contrast to her approach when in Opposition.  It seems extraordinary she has chosen not to put an inspector into the National Irish Bank.  Today I got a list of the depositors which I have not had time to study, but it makes fascinating reading.  It contains many well known names which one would recognise at a glance, even in this House.  I regret I only have one minute remaining and I am sorry we gave five minutes to the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, because I would have liked to have dealt with this in more detail.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, was for openness, transparency and accountability when on this side of the House, but now she is in Government nothing warrants investigation.  She knows in this case the Revenue Commissioners will never tell us what they find or do not find. The attempt to withhold from this House information on a critical issue of public importance, such as the issue of Irish registered non-resident companies here, is a very serious matter and, like Deputy McDowell, I look forward to what the Minister, Deputy Harney, has to say for herself this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government protests that the emergence of this issue is connected to the by-elections. However, I doubt electioneering is behind this because I can think of 101 other issues on the minds of the people of Dublin North, judging from my canvassing, and this matter is not at the top of the list.  The postponement of local elections, waste management, transport and horticulture <Col N="1537" /> are much more on people's minds than this issue, although that might change.</P>
      <P>What is worthy of note is the degree of ignorance surrounding the subject.  Comments from the Minister, Deputy Harney, through her Department, and from the Government in general show that Irish company law can be, is being and will continue to be abused for tax evasion and possibly even for criminal purposes.  This being so, the amount of complacency shown by the Minister seems to imply a tolerance of dubious business ethics.  She has not shown the same tolerance and concern towards groups such as lone parents.</P>
      <P>Outside of ethical concerns, the Government seems unwilling to take on board other issues, just as serious, arising from the behaviour of the Minister and her Department and the ability of the Department to effectively monitor commercial activity.  On the question of informing the Dáil, the Minister has been well and truly exposed.  The contrast between her behaviour in Opposition and in Government is all too obvious, as has been noted by previous speakers.  The defence that she and the Minister of State have responded in the manner in which the previous Government treated such questions is no defence. She has resorted to defending a culture that continues to treat freedom of information with contempt.</P>
      <P>Of equal concern is that the information which was made available reveals that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has little idea how many Irish registered non-resident companies there are.  Why should this be?  Are registration forms not filled?  Is the information not being collated?  This hardly inspires confidence in the ability of the Department to monitor business activity in the State if such information is not readily to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of other State agencies to these revelations is worrying, to say the least.  The IDA has urged caution and said we should not make too radical a series of changes to the system of registering non-resident companies.  It fears that multinational companies who have come to Ireland may be less inclined to come for manufacturing purposes if they are not also allowed to establish shelf companies to limit their tax liabilities in other countries.  There was a time when the IDA claimed multinational companies were attracted to this country because of access to the single European market, even if this country's geographic position was and continues to be peripheral to the main population centres in that market.  The agency was in the habit of speaking about the &ldquo;young Europeans&rdquo;, the youngest population in Europe which received one of the highest standards of education in the world.  In the light of the questions raised by the leaks, these sales points seem to have been only gloss. The IDA's underlying message is that multinational investment is largely because of generous rates of corporation tax, with the added incentive of creating company structures which <Col N="1538" /> will help to avoid or even evade tax elsewhere. That is the implication of the fudge which the Minister and Minister of State have done nothing to clarify.</P>
    <P>The policy implications need to be considered and acted on by the Government.  Is it national policy to tolerate and condone the establishment of shelf companies to avoid the payment of tax, wherever it is due?  Does the Government, by its failure to act, tolerate what the people are not prepared to tolerate when Irish owned companies and public figures, some associated with this House, seek recourse to tax havens in other countries?</P>
    <P>The House has established tribunals of inquiry into the financial activities of Irish citizens making use of foreign company law and banking regulations in ways which, it now transpires, Irish legislation facilitates foreign nationals to do here. Further questions need to be asked about the extent to which Irish citizens have been involved with the establishment of these shelf companies. How many are directors?  What roles do they play?  These questions lead to further questions and, like peeling an onion, the Government may yet find it will all end in tears.</P>
    <P>The solutions are obvious.  Irish company law must be amended so that any company registered in Ireland must carry out all or part of its activities here.  Failure to do so will show this Government's disgraceful tolerance of what is, in effect, white collar crime in many instances.</P>
    <P>The Minister was at pains to point out the need for a balance between attracting inward investment and ensuring compliance with the law.  That balance, however, must take into account that indigenous enterprise must also face the implications of the current policy.  We should welcome genuine overseas investors who respect the law and are here to do a job from which we all benefit but we must also protect the interests of our people, environment, indigenous enterprise and tax code.</P>
    <P>As TD for Dublin North, I know of indigenous enterprises which have applied for licences with the aid of IDA and Forbairt.  In one instance, a clean indigenous industry, involved in washing and packing prawns, was subject to rumours and verbal opposition from foreign companies, and the authorities were dissuaded from granting the Irish company a licence.  That imbalance will make Ireland more vulnerable to the winds of change blowing internationally in the economic and commercial world.  We must redress that balance so that we do not penalise enterprising indigenous companies through our tolerance of questionable practices, which have been highlighted by the reply to Deputy McManus's parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that in Opposition Deputy Harney was forthright in insisting freedom of information was the way of the future, but now she is a Minister such freedom is strictly curtailed and we do not get the information to which the House is entitled.  That is a reflection on the people who <Col N="1539" /> vote for us &mdash; they are regarded as somehow not entitled to the information either.  The Freedom of Information Act should be introduced quickly and in a form strong enough to stop the concealment which is leading to widespread cynicism &mdash; any Ministers who have been on the by-election trail will be familiar with that.</P>

      <P>Despite all the fuss and recent commentaries, the problem of Irish registered non-resident companies &mdash; or IRNRs, as they are known &mdash; is not a new one. The issue has been around for a number of years and was considered by my predecessor, who consulted the then Minister of State responsible for commerce, Deputy Rabbitte, on what might be done.  These discussions and consultations were ongoing at official level in a variety of working groups.</P>
      <P>As my predecessor will recall, he included a section in the Finance Act, 1995 to try to deal with the issue by requiring IRNRs to provide certain information to the Revenue Commissioners.  I quote from the explanatory memorandum to the Bill as passed by the Dáil:</P>
      <P>Section 58 requires Irish registered companies which are not resident in the State for tax purposes to supply certain information to the Revenue Commissioners.  The information required includes the name and registered office of the company, its place of business, the nature of the business, the identity of the territory in which it is managed and controlled. Companies which carry on a trade in the State are not required to give information under the provision as they are subject to other information requirements.  The measure is being introduced because certain Irish incorporated non-resident companies have been used for undesirable activities and have brought Irish incorporated companies into disrepute.</P>
      <P>There it is in black and white in the explanatory memorandum &mdash; the use of IRNRs posed a threat to the good name of genuine business activity because of certain undesirable activities.  From reading some of the articles in the media last month one would imagine this issue had been created recently.  A little more digging would have found that the 1995 explanatory memorandum to the Finance Bill acknowledged the concern. As the House knows, explanatory memoranda to Bills are public documents available to all concerned and are not secret or hidden.</P>
      <P>One might ask what the outcome of section 58 was.  The intention was to turn the spotlight on those using company formation for unacceptable purposes and in this way to encourage them to conduct their affairs elsewhere.  Section 58, unfortunately, has not been as successful as was wished in deterring such companies from carrying on undesirable activities.  The net point is that further solutions must be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> I hope it is plain that this is a problem we inherited and one that the previous Government, for understandable reasons, found very difficult to solve.  The aim is to get shut of the undesirables, protect the financial reputation of the State and allow those companies legitimately using company law structures for acceptable ends to continue to so do.</P>
    <P>The information already in the public domain indicates that certain IRNRs are used in connection with job creating foreign direct investment, or FDI, in the State.  Deputy Rabbitte's press statement acknowledges that.  Unfortunately, one might get the impression that FDI companies are engaged in the undesirable activities referred to. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Quinn, was very aware of the foreign direct investment aspect and the need to take into account the ramifications in that area of any solution which might be essayed. I do not criticise him for the action taken in 1995, even if it was a less than effective solution.  I listened to what the Labour Party spokesperson, Deputy McDowell, said about IRNRs, which was a total contradiction of what his party leader rightly had in mind when he was Minister for Finance. If the Deputy wishes me to give him some details on the matter I will do so.</P>
    <P>Deputies Quinn and Rabbitte acknowledge this is a very complex area which is not easily solved. I did not hear Deputy Rabbitte put forward a solution as simplistic as that suggested by Deputy McDowell because he knows the issue has ramifications and is not easily solved.  There is correspondence on this matter between the then Ministers, Deputies Quinn and Rabbitte, from 1995. It is difficult to find an equitable solution to this complex matter which will not damage the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>We must be clear about the need to focus a solution on those fraudsters or moneylaunderers we wish to send on their way.  My aim and that of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is to do that without damaging legitimate and acceptable business practices.  I deplore the message which is going out that this country is a Cayman Islands type tax haven. Those making such allegations for political capital should reflect on the repercussions of such assertions.</P>
    <P>I say this in all sincerity and notwithstanding the two impending by-elections.  I have held a well known view in both Government and Opposition that there should be a three month moratorium before elections during which anything said by politicians would be put into a machine and cleansed.  Elections seem to send many people a little astray &mdash; I make that allegation about all Members.</P>
    <P>People should reflect on the possible effect of what they recently said or implied about our financial system.  It is all right for political purposes to shout and roar and make allegations from the back of a lorry or in a hall to try to win a few extra votes for one's side.  However, some of <Col N="1541" /> these allegations are media commentaries which are being relayed around the world to our competitors.</P>
    <P>Those who have been in Government, either in Cabinet or as Ministers of State, should know the effect this has on Ireland's reputation.  This might not be recognised by politicians who have not held office, but those who have know it is extremely damaging and is used by our competitors. Last year international magazines were writing about the Celtic tiger.  There are now items in such magazines about Irish scandals.  Someone has now come up with the idea that Ireland is a Cayman Islands type tax haven.</P>
    <P>I have often been guilty of engaging in soundbite politics and I readily recognise there were probably many soundbites over the years which I should not have given.  However, I ask Members to be a little more responsible in this regard.  I do not expect the media, whose job it is to sell newspapers, to be responsible in this regard because they have another agenda.  However, I expect people who should know better to refrain from making outlandish allegations which are being relayed abroad and damaging the Irish cause.  I said that when I was in Opposition and I am saying it again now that I am in Government. I ask Members to be a little more responsible.</P>
    <P>I plan to address this issue in a measured and rational way, although I recognise that action needs to be taken as quickly as possible.  My Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be tasked to continue working towards a practical solution from a company law and tax perspective and to come up with a set of measures at an early date.  I then plan to publish this and seek comments from all concerned, and it will then be for the Government to decide and announce the action it will take.</P>
    <P>The Members opposite can hardly take issue with that.  They dithered over the issue.  I now have said how the Government plans to proceed through consultation.  The Opposition has urged me to adopt such a process of reflection and consultation in regard to various items in the Finance Bill, ranging from betting hours to self-assessment filing dates.  It can hardly object to me adopting in this case the <i>modus operandi</i> which it has urged on me in other matters.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear there should be no place for these undesirables in the company register of this State.  The last Government failed to solve the issue of how to weed them out in a way that left the healthy plants alone.  Let us see if this Government can do better.</P>

      <P>The fact is the Minister of State has not withdrawn the statements he made on television last night, although he indirectly admits he was wrong.  However, he has not the guts or the stature to admit plainly and upfront that he was wrong.  He admits in his statement that the last Government did deal with the matter in the 1995 Finance Act.  The current Minister for Finance confirms that.  He says that it is a complex area and that the solution we came up with was not adequate.  That is obvious, but we did attempt to deal with it.</P>
      <P>It is typical of Fianna Fáil when they are in trouble that they reach for the &ldquo;national interest&rdquo;.  They say that we should not criticise what the Government is doing because the newspapers around the world will print it, that if things are wrong we should be quiet about it because it is not in the national interest to raise these matters. The Minister did not use the words &ldquo;national interest&rdquo; but that is what he is saying, that we must keep quiet on this side of the House in relation to serious matters because the international media will pick it up and run with it.</P>

      <P>Instead of criticising Opposition parties for doing their job in this House, the Minister should admit that he and previous Governments have failed so far to come up with a solution, that it is a serious problem, and that it has to be dealt with.  Otherwise our reputation will continue to be damaged by the existence of these companies which are here not only for the purpose of avoiding tax but for the purpose of laundering money.  These are serious matters, and whether or not it is damaging to the <Col N="1543" /> image of the country they are matters that have to be dealt with.  They would not be dealt with, we would not be having this debate, we would not be pressing the Government to deal with these things urgently but for the fact that a memorandum for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was inadvertently attached to a bland reply to a parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>I listened with astonishment to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, on the radio this morning when she challenged the interviewer to identify what was in the memorandum that was not in the reply.  The reply runs to one and a half pages, with plenty of space between paragraphs.  The background memorandum runs to five pages containing eight paragraphs, yet the Minster is saying that the concrete information in that background note was included in the reply to the question.  Clearly that is not the case.  I have identified five specific issues that are not dealt with in the reply.</P>
      <P>The background note states: &ldquo;Essentially the IRNR structure is primarily a mechanism used by US companies to defer indefinitely the payment of US tax&rdquo;.  That is not in the reply the Minister gave to this House.  It also states: &ldquo;Revenue are unlikely to have any interface with such companies because being non-resident Revenue would have no tax interest in income generated outside Ireland&rdquo;.  That is not in the reply the Minister gave to the House.  It also states: &ldquo;Some of these companies have been found to engage in undesirable activities world-wide such as fraud, money laundering and other illegal activity&rdquo;.  That is not in the reply the Minster gave to the House.  It also states:</P>
      <P>The fact that they are Irish registered reflects badly on the reputation of Ireland.  More particularly, they are perceived as being regulated in the same way as companies operating from the IFSC which of course they are not, but this perception seriously damages the reputation of the IFSC as a centre where reputable companies are properly regulated.  These problems have been highlighted in recent media reports &mdash; sample attached.</P>
      <P>That was not in the reply the Minister gave to the House.</P>
      <P>I could go on.  In paragraph 5, on the Department's position, it is stated:</P>
      <P>As regards a tax based solution the IDA continue to be opposed to the abolition of IRNRs because of their use by MMCs with operations here but this view continues to be based on the Big 6 accountancy firms' study who of course have a vested interest in retaining the <i>status quo</i> because of the business it provides for them.</P>
      <P>That was not in the reply given by the Minister to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is deliberate concealment of information from this House.  Deputy Rabbitte has already <Col N="1544" /> read out the comments the Minister made when she alleged that Deputy John Bruton, when he was Taoiseach, did not reveal information to this House on a particular occasion.  She made the point that Deputies were expected to know the right questions to ask.  She is applying exactly the same criteria she accused the then Taoiseach of applying.  As it happens, Deputy Bruton was not guilty of doing that.  However, the evidence is there now that the Minister, Deputy Harney, has herself been guilty of what she accused other people of, that is, deliberately withholding important information from the Deputies of this House, from the Parliament of this country.  That is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>It may, in the normal rough and tumble of politics, be acceptable for the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to refuse to apologise for his statements on television last night in regard to Deputy Rabbitte, although it would be better if he had the guts to do so.  However, I am not even sure that an apology to this House from the Minister, Deputy Harney, would be sufficient in relation to deliberately keeping this information from the House on advice from her officials.  I do not blame her officials for giving her that advice. As a Minister I got advice from officials many times which I chose to ignore in the interests of giving this House full information.  The Minister accepted the advice and chose not to give this very serious and important information to this House when she was advised not to do so.  I would expect her to come here today and explain why she took that decision, why she felt that the Members of this House, the Parliament of this country, were not to be trusted with the information she had to hand in replying to that question.</P>
    <P>It also raises serious questions about the use of Question Time, particularly written questions.  I do not know whether anybody has noticed, but I rarely put in a question for written reply in this House because I get nonsense replies.  One never gets hard information from a Minister in answer to a question for written reply.  As for oral Question Time, it has come to the point where five or six questions are dealt with in ordinary Question Time.  I do not have access to Priority Questions. The possibility of Deputies in this House getting an oral reply and being able to put supplementary questions to winkle out the information they need is practically non-existent.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, that are being taken to promote the re-opening of the live cattle trade to third countries, particularly Egypt, Libya and Iran; the current position on his previously reported trial shipment of 2,000 cattle to Egypt; his views on whether the live trade will be re-opened and, if so, when; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained in the Dáil previously, it is a priority for me to ensure that BSE related restrictions on our live cattle trade are removed.  Egypt and Libya have traditionally been important markets for Irish live cattle exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A technical delegation from my Department recently visited Egypt.  One of the objectives of this visit was to discuss further the possibility of reopening the trade in live cattle on the basis of the proposal for a trial shipment which I submitted <Col N="1546" /> last November to the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture.  The delegation provided up to date information and further assurances on the BSE situation in Ireland to the Egyptian authorities.  The proposal is being considered by the Egyptian authorities in the light of the additional information provided.</P>
    <P>In the case of Libya, contact is continuing through a number of channels with a view to having the live cattle trade restored.  It should also be noted that a consistent level of live exports to the Lebanon has developed this year.</P>
    <P>As regards Iran, the recent restoration of diplomatic relations with that country facilitated the resumption of discussions with the Iranian authorities to have the ban on imports of Irish beef lifted.  A veterinary delegation from my Department travelled to Teheran three weeks ago for this purpose.  Additional information was supplied to the Iranian veterinary authorities and they accepted an invitation to continue discussions in Ireland.  I hope we can convince the Iranian authorities of the safety and quality of Irish beef so that trade can resume.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hardly need mention that in Opposition the Minister and the Taoiseach made strong statements about the desirability of re-opening this trade.  In January the Taoiseach said at the AGM of the IFA that it was one of his highest priorities.  What support is the Minister getting from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs because it will take a combined effort from all of the relevant Departments as well as that of the Minister to re-open this trade?</P>
      <P>I asked when the live trade will be re-opened and, while I know it is difficult for the Minister to name a date, I want some indication of when he thinks this trade might be re-opened.  In my lower level inquiries I have heard various dates mentioned.  What is his opinion about this?</P>
      <P>My understanding is that this trial shipment proposal is a non-runner.  If that is not the case, will he confirm it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The re-opening of the live cattle trade is quite a difficult problem in Egypt.  It is a priority for Government to the extent that I visited Cairo at an early stage in the life of the Government.  In addition, technical delegations at the most senior veterinary and, more recently, engineering levels of the Department of Agriculture and Food have visited Egypt because the Egyptian authorities demanded certain assurances about Irish live cattle.  Each time we provided answers to their queries and satisfied their technical questions.  They then said they would be prepared to take a live shipment but that we would have to provide the facilities to remove specified risk material.  We said we would be prepared to do that and supervise it in one of their factories.  That is why an engineering element accompanied the recent delegations.  We have chosen one of their factories and cordoned off an area so that live cattle can be slaughtered and the <Col N="1547" /> risk material removed.  Nonetheless, the Egyptians have not yet made a decision to accept live cattle from Ireland.</P>
      <P>To do a deal one needs a vendor and a purchaser. We have allayed the concerns of the Egyptian authorities and technical veterinary people about Irish cattle, but it is a matter for the Egyptian authorities to make the decision to purchase live animals.</P>
      <P>The Egyptians make the point that they are taking a considerable quantity of Irish beef and they are entirely satisfied with it.  We are very satisfied with that trade, which doubled from 1996 to 1997.  We obviously want that trade to continue, but we want to supplement it with substantial numbers of live cattle.</P>
      <P>A similar situation exists in Libya.  That trade was terminated in 1996 and we have since been seeking to have it re-opened.  Contacts are continuing there at a number of levels, but particularly through the Embassy in Rome because there is no Embassy in Tripoli.  Any contact there must be made over land because no flights are allowed in.  That is quite difficult but, nonetheless, we are following up on the matter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, diplomatic relations with Iran were withdrawn some time ago but they have been restored recently with the EU.  Immediately they were restored, we sent a technical delegation there.  They were asked to allay a number of concerns and we have responded to those.  We do not have any difficulty in meeting the technical requirements, but it is a matter for Iran to recommence that trade.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coveney asked specifically about support from the Taoiseach.  Support has been readily forthcoming from the Taoiseach.  He has communicated at the highest level with the Egyptian authorities.</P>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has been similarly supportive.</P>
      <P>A senior Foreign Affairs official accompanied the officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food on the recent trip.  The Embassy in Rome, which is under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has been exceptionally helpful in relation to the Libyan trade and everything possible is being done to reopen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem in Egypt in that consumers are not differentiating between British and Irish beef.  They know British beef is BSE infected and we are being tarred with the same brush.  What action is the Minister or An Bord Bia taking in regard to promotional marketing in Egypt to counter that impression because if Egyptian consumers continue to hold that view, no government will decide to bring in live Irish cattle?  I suspect there is something that should, but which is not, being done.</P>

      <P>In relation to the promotion of Irish beef, I was accompanied on my trip, as were the technical delegations, by personnel from An Bord <Col N="1548" /> Bia.  On my visit to Cairo I made a point of meeting and entertaining the agricultural media so that we could speak directly to them, and they carried positive articles in the Egyptian press. During the term of my predecessor, the Egyptian media came to Ireland on the invitation of the Department and wrote glowing articles about production conditions here.  We are doing everything possible to communicate the good image of Irish beef to Egyptian consumers.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to ensure there will be a more equitable and fairer system for the allocation and distribution of EU beef supports to drystock farming families to ensure that they will have a reasonable income and prevent the drift of these families from the land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the European Commission published outline proposals for the reform of the beef regime last July as part of Agenda 2000.  The proposals are based on reducing support prices and providing a greater level of direct payments to farmers.  Detailed proposals are expected to be adopted and published by the Commission next month.</P>
      <P>It is my intention, in the context of the negotiations on these proposals, to seek full and equitable compensation for any cuts in prices to ensure the continued viability of the maximum number of family farms in the country and to ensure that beef production remains an integral part of our agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have our support in trying to secure the best deal in the forthcoming negotiations.  We now draw down 12 per cent of EU premium payments and we must ensure that national envelope is protected.  The Minister will also have our support in resisting the modified proposals emanating from the EU to cut beef prices by 25p to 30p per pound which would have devastating effects in the long-term on the socio-economic structure of rural Ireland. As the Minister is aware, 100 farmers per week are leaving farming, agricultural colleges are unable to fill their quotas and two-thirds of farmers are on an income of £5,000 per year.  Most of those are part of the 100,000 drystock farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister agree that drystock farmers are in need of an increased focus of aid and that the beef heifer area should be examined in relation to any new proposals?  The suckler cow premium is the genesis of quality beef production in Ireland.  Will he agree to examine these two areas because there have not been any subsidies or premia in relation to beef heifers in the past? Furthermore, is the Minister open to other proposals to ensure beef farmers are not left out of any aspect of beef production because many of <Col N="1549" /> them believe there is not a clear understanding of the loss they have suffered, particularly in the past four years?  Many beef farmers are considering their future.  We are now in the last chance saloon where beef farmers are concerned and I ask the Minister to give an assurance that he is open to innovative proposals, both from farming organisations and Members, to redress the imbalance beef farmers believe has existed since the MacSharry proposals in 1992?  Many of them feel left out of the system and that has had a major impact on their viability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Santer proposals will be published next month and there will be an opportunity during the year &mdash; it is anticipated the negotiations will continue until the end of the year &mdash; to examine the proposals to ensure there is no loss of EU support or loss of income for farmers and that there is an equitable distribution of EU support without losing any of the overall support.</P>
      <P>In relation to beef, Ireland receives 12 per cent of the total beef premia while producing only 7 per cent of beef.  It could be argued that we have done relatively well in that regard.  On the question of whether this support has been equitably distributed, winter finishers argue that they were left out of the loop.  We will have an opportunity in the forthcoming negotiations to redress any perceived inequities.  I have already set up a consultative group in relation to beef and all the farming organisations, particularly those concerned with winter finishers, are represented on it with the IFA, the ICMSA and Macra na Feirme.  We must get the best possible outcome of the detailed negotiations.  Price reductions of 30 per cent are considerable by any standards and already in 1997 direct payments on average accounted for 47 per cent of farmers' incomes, so they are becoming critically important.</P>
      <P>In relation to the proposals, documents were leaked over the past few weeks which I understand are fairly close to what the published document will be.  In the leaked documents the suggestion is that, in addition to the direct payments, there will be a national envelope of support and it will be up to the member state to divide that out in a more equitable manner.  As a member state we will have a better chance in that regard but the person dividing it will find it difficult to please everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at developments in the UK market where most of the UK retail multiples have decided not to source beef originating outside Britain for the duration of the British beef promotion campaign recently launched by the Meat and Livestock Commission.  The problem is being addressed on a number of levels. As an immediate response, I asked Bord Bia to intensify direct contact with British retailers and to provide a detailed analysis of the situation in that market.  In addition, I arranged to meet senior management of the major UK retail chains and I have liaised closely with farming organisations and the beef processing sector.  Meetings took place in Dublin the week before last with representatives of the largest UK multiple, and on Monday last I travelled to London to meet senior management of all the major UK multiples.  The purpose of my involvement was to stress the seriousness with which the Government views these developments and to seek a return to normal trade in Irish beef on the UK market.  I was assured at the meetings of the long-term future for Irish beef on the UK retail market and that the retailers will continue contacts with Irish exporters with the objective of restoring normal trading arrangements.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, at my request Bord Bia is preparing a detailed strategy to defend our traditional place in the UK and other EU beef markets. At a political level, the Taoiseach has already brought to the attention of the British Prime Minister the problems difficulty of access to the UK market are causing for our beef industry.  I have had the full support of my Government colleagues in this matter.  I am also using all appropriate contacts at EU level to express our concerns about the campaign in the UK, the effects of which are contrary to the spirit of free trade and the Single Market.</P>
      <P>The solution to the present difficulties lies in working together with the UK retailers who, while sensitive to the particular problems facing UK farmers, nevertheless recognise the quality of the product we offer and the commitment of our beef industry to supplying the UK market.  Combined with a renewed and intensified promotional effort, this approach is the most effective way of enabling Irish beef exports to retain and ultimately expand market share in the UK.</P>

      <P>What does the Minister think of that advertisement, given that it is entirely against the spirit and letter of the common market? Tesco admits the Irish product of equal or better quality is 20 per cent cheaper, yet it stocks only British beef.  We have a right to that market.  Has the Minister put the case not only to Tesco and others but to his counterparts in the British Government?  It is a disgrace that in a common market &mdash; we have an open market for British goods &mdash; we are blatantly discriminated against. What assurances did the Minister receive on this matter?  I am aware he has no control over it, but when does he expect the problem will be resolved?  Who is co-ordinating this effort?  Given that the Minister has responsibility for this matter, what is the strategy of the Minister of State and chairman of the joint Oireachtas committee who went on a similar mission the week before the Minister and to some extent pre-empted his role?  This is a serious problem which must be resolved.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy Coveney's comments on the unfairness, incompatibility and, in some instances, illegality of what is happening in the British market.  First there was a ports blockade, which was illegal.  At that time I met my counterpart, Dr. Jack Cunningham, who admitted publicly in a press conference after our meeting, at which I put our case strongly, that the blocade was illegal and unacceptable, and that came to an end.  The campaign then turned to the supermarket boardrooms and depots.  Perhaps £50 million pounds worth of fresh food is stored in depots and if a problem arises huge losses will be incurred.  We are a traditional supplier and, as a member state of the European Union, we have a right to the British market.</P>
      <P>We have supplied that market for many decades, originally with cattle on the hoof and then with quality Irish beef.  There is no question about the quality of our beef.  The difficulty is that British farmers, who say they are getting a poor price for their cattle, use British supermarkets to target Irish beef.  Apart from Summerfield, which still has Irish beef on the shelves, all other supermarkets have removed Irish beef from the shelves. We want to ensure that is restored immediately, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senior management of British supermarkets say they have a difficulty with pickets and unacceptable behaviour from sections of, in their words, maverick groups of British farmers who have targeted Irish beef.  They continue to take Irish beef, but it is not put on the shelves.  Ireland traditionally supplies the UK with almost 100,000 tonnes of beef, a portion of which is sold from <Col N="1552" /> the supermarket shelves and the remainder goes through the catering and service trade generally. The most lucrative end of the market is the supermarket shelves and we want our meat back on those shelves as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have been assured that when the Meat and Livestock Commission promotion ends at the end of March there will be an opportunity to get our meat back on the shelves.  The British have said they will not renege on their loyalty to Irish suppliers. They do not have much option because they are only 78 per cent self-sufficient in beef &mdash; they import 22 per cent, which amounts to 230,000 tonnes and we supply 100,000 tonnes. Every effort is being made to solve this problem. The Taoiseach communicated with the Prime Minister on the matter and the Tánaiste also had a meeting yesterday.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, visited the Meat and Livestock Commission and I visited the boardrooms of supermarket chains.  While in London I spoke to the British Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Jack Cunningham, with a view to restoring normality in this market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has the support of the Labour Party in exploring every avenue to secure this vital and traditional market for beef farmers.  Will he agree the action of the British multiples is the antithesis of the level playing pitch about which we hear much and which is the cornerstone of EU policy and the free market principle?  Will the Minister agree it is ironic that, while we are preparing to vote on the Amsterdam Treaty, which is a further step towards integration, the Single Market is disintegrating before our eyes in so far as an excellent Irish product is being taken off the shelves by a fellow member state?</P>
      <P>In view of the proposals in Agenda 2000, would it be prudent to seek to have the EU Commission investigate this matter, particularly as it relates to Articles, 36, 48 and 85 of the EU Treaty?  I appreciate the Buy Irish Campaign was a different matter in that State aid was put into that campaign, but it would be opportune to examine this matter from the point of view of EU law and the importance of maintaining a level playing pitch. British farmers are experiencing difficulties and we are aware of the sensitivities involved, but the UK imports 22 per cent of its beef requirements and we produce a top quality product.</P>

      <P>I accept the case put forward by Deputy Penrose in respect of the apparent incompatibility with EU law, particularly Article 85.  I raised this matter formally at the European Council of Agricultural Ministers and informally with Commissioner Fischler.  I am informed it is being closely monitored and examined.  My colleagues have also raised the matter with the competition Commissioner and I have raised it with the British political establishment.  The difficulty with raising matters at European level is that it takes a long time, up to three years, to obtain a decision. Nonetheless, a decision must be made.</P>
      <P>With regard to Irish beef producers being targeted by British farmers, I believe the wrong people are being targeted.  We are not creating the problem of low incomes for British farmers.  I am informed that these people want their Government to take action on their behalf and they use the example of how well farmers in this country are treated.  They believe they are getting a raw deal in the UK.</P>
      <P>Ireland supplies between 95,000 to 100,000 of the 230,000 tonnes of beef required.  Beef, lamb and other products are being imported from South American countries, New Zealand and Australia.  Apparently, these countries are not being singled out to the same degree as Ireland. I questioned this and was informed that the importation of Irish beef is very visible.  Welsh farmers are most aggressive in respect of Irish beef, which is offloaded at Fishguard and transported through Wales by truck.  To these people, lorries with logos which identify them as carrying Irish beef are similar to waving a red rag at a bull. However, that is no excuse.  We are demanding nothing more than to allow consumers a free choice.  As a compliant EU member state, Ireland maintains an open attitude in respect of consumer preference.  We are demanding similar treatment in the UK.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult situation.  I met representatives of Bord Bia, processors, farmers and producers and informed them that when the MLC campaign concludes on 1 April there will be a requirement to identify the country of origin on produce.  For the first time, beef produced in this country will be labelled as Irish.  That has also happened in other European Union countries.  I have asked Bord Bia to draw up a targeted promotional programme to cope with that.  We have been able to avail of old brand systems and export beef without country of origin labels. However, from 1 April, we will have to be in a position to cope with the new requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of cross compliance was recommended by an independent report and was agreed by the Government in early 1997.  Cross compliance will be confined to overgrazed commonages, including those overgrazed commonages in special areas of conservation and special protection areas.  The implementation of cross compliance is dependent upon the agreement of a revised REPS compensation package for farmers who have lands in special areas of conservation or special protection areas.  My Department issued revised conditions on 10 December 1997 to exclude leased commonage and grazing rights from eligibility for payment under the REPS scheme and to require intending participants with owned commonage to be farming a minimum of ten acres of privately held land.</P>
      <P>Detailed discussions have been taking place with the European Commission on the revised REPS/SAC package, including the matter of the minimum area of private land for applicants with commonage land.  Agreement on the new package is critical for the eligibility of commonage lands for REPS payment purposes and every effort is being made to bring the discussions to a successful and speedy conclusion.  Farmers who may be unable to join the REPS scheme can avail of the national scheme which is being operated by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State rescind the ten acre rule immediately?  This rule affects many farmers in areas in the west such as Connemara, Achill and north County Mayo.  Of 200 farmers in the Achill area, 80 per cent will be affected by the new ruling.  The average size of a farm in the Achill area is 3.5 acres.  A proportion of the land in the area is held in leased commonage and turbary rights must also be taken into consideration. Is the Department seriously considering changing this rule?  There have been statements from Fianna Fáil politicians indicating that the Minister of State is about to change it.</P>
      <P>I tabled a number of questions in recent weeks on this issue and was informed about the Minister of State's ongoing discussions with Europe.  When does he hope to be in a position to change the cross compliance rule?  A deal was agreed with the IFA in February of last year in respect of NHAs and SACs?  When will farmers obtain payment from the provisions of that deal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope discussions with the European Commission will be completed in the coming <Col N="1555" /> weeks.  However, these discussions are detailed and are particularly concerned with commonage because the voluntary REPS scheme for the destocking of commonage areas was completely unsuccessful.  The Commission requires that the new package will be a strong one.  As Members are aware, Europe is giving increasing consideration to the environmental side of farming. I hope the discussions will be completed as soon as possible.  However, negotiations are ongoing and they are poised at a particularly tense stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question on the deal with the IFA, payment will be made to farmers when negotiations with farmers and unions on agreements and compliance have been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware this matter involves an overall package which must be approved by Europe.  However, is it not possible to rescind the ten acre rule &mdash; which was originally put in place by the Government &mdash; so that the farmers in question can take part in REP schemes without affecting their headage and premia payments?  Is it not possible to remove the decision on the ten acre rule from the overall package?  Is the Government not in a position to rescind it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is a member of the European Union which is responsible for funding this project.  Therefore, we must consult the Commission and obtain its permission and agreement in respect of these matters.  The Commission is being strict and stringent on the new package because of the failure of the voluntary scheme.  It is particularly concerned about commonage land which is devoid of vegetation and on which landslides, falls, etc., have occurred.  We must consider the concept that such areas are owned by all the people of Europe who must be allowed to enjoy them rather than see them destroyed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State does not change the rule, the farmers, not the vegetation, will disappear.  REPS planners in Connemara, south Mayo and west Mayo have received very few new files in the past three months as a result of the cross compliance rule.  What is the point in discussing the preservation of special areas of conservation under the REPS scheme, which was originally designed to make the country environmentally friendly?  The Minister of State has introduced a scheme which has the opposite effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the thinking behind the ten acre rule? Officials of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands obviously believe it is a good yardstick to use.  However, it is crazy and it has destroyed a good scheme.  I put it to the Minister of State that the rule has nothing to do with Europe.  It was <Col N="1556" /> cooked up by the authorities in Ireland and it should be changed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister of State's assertion about the voluntary scheme.  The numbers of sheep grazing on the hills must be reduced.</P>
    <P>Farmers in those areas will do that.  However, many small sheep farmers in those areas who have cattle will have to get rid of them because they cannot fence the rivers and valleys adjoining their holdings.  People will be deprived of an income based on an environmentally sensitive scheme which we had hoped would protect the areas.</P>

One of the reasons was that the voluntary REPS did not work.  In negotiations on the conditions to be applied in designated environmental areas, NHAs and SACs, the farm bodies and planners agreed that participation in REPS should not be allowed to negate the benefits of the scheme in the overgrazed areas.  The then Minister also agreed with the recommendation of the Kearney report on headage that participation in REPS would be a qualifying factor for headage payments.

    <P>There are about 10,000 farmers in this area and about 1,000 have overgrazed commonages. However, there were people leasing commonage who were not farmers.  They were using the scheme.  There were also people who were not full-time farmers who were using two schemes, one in Connemara and another in other areas of <Col N="1557" /> County Galway, and drawing a double benefit.

They cannot include their grazing rights because in the Land Acts 1870 to 1939 the fee simple was not transferred to them.

That measure will apply for 15 years.  The main problem for the EU is with commonage.  In addition to cross compliance the EU is insisting on drawing up a framework plan for designating overgrazed commonages.  That will be difficult of itself because opinions differ. However, it wants to ensure that stock numbers are compatible with environmental sustainability, that the damaged areas will be allowed to recover and that the people are compensated properly. The payments are quite good for those areas.</P>

To date five of the 66 farmers from County Mayo have been paid.  I know the Minister of State is committed to this issue but are the departmental officials committed to paying <Col N="1558" /> these farmers?  Why is it taking so long?  It is a problem that affects the Minister of State's county.  When will the farmers in County Mayo be paid?</P>

There is a genuine feeling that if their stocking rate is to be reduced the money should be paid.  I commend the officials for their work on this issue.</P>
      <P>The main problems are with the 100 per cent leased commonage and the ten acre rule.  There was also a problem with an audit visit that was carried out.  A farmer was asked what he was doing on the commonage now that he was not doing five years before and he replied that he was doing nothing differently.  That is what has caused these problems with the commonage.  Not only does the Commission feel that the voluntary scheme was a failure but it feels that there might not be compliance under the new measures.  The difficulty lies in persuading the Commission that this will work.  We must take into account the needs of people who do not have thousands of sheep.</P>

      <P>When I was in the Department of Defence we looked at some innovative schemes with the Minister for Finance to encourage private individuals to lease or purchase horses for the Army Equitation School on a tax related basis which would allow the school to obtain high quality horses rather than it having to purchase them as it is very expensive.  Will the Minister consider looking at those possibilities? Certain individuals may want to be associated with the Irish equitation team through sponsorship.</P>

      <P>I will take this up with the Minister for Finance.  I spoke to the Minister for Defence and he said there is a tremendous tradition in the Army Equitation School, from Dan Corry, a Corkman, in the 1930s to Billy Ringrose and Ned Campion who are household names.  They promoted the image of the Irish horse internationally in a unique way.  I support any innovation that will assist in getting better quality horses into the school at a young age.  It is exasperating, even though it is of value to the country, to find Irish bred horses on other teams defeating Irish teams. We will go to all lengths possible, for the Army in particular, to seek to help the equitation school.  I spoke to Dr. Noel Cawley of the Irish Horse <Col N="1560" /> Board and my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Dr. McDaid, to see if the national lottery could help.  When in office previously, I raised the matter of structural funding for the school, but every time the issue was taken up in Brussels it was turned down because a State Department was directly involved in it. We could not produce a formula which complied with European Commission regulations.  Everything will be done to maintain a good source of quality Irish horses for the school.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the possibility of getting horses for the Garda.  It would be a shame if we had to go to Yorkshire.  I was there a number of years ago and locals spoke about the need to come to Ireland for horses. Breeders and others involved should be encouraged to train horses to supply the needs of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister for Justice on this issue.  I asked why he had to go to another country for horses, of which we have plenty.  He pointed out Irish horses were looked at but was informed by experts that it takes four years to train a horse for crowd control.  There is a requirement for eight horses, the first four of which are already trained and then Irish horses will be trained subsequently.  I suggested to him also that it might be a good idea to have horses and carriages for ceremonial occasions in Dublin. I recall at spring shows in the RDS the late Joe McGrath had a carriage and six white steeds, which were impressive.  This would also promote the image of the Irish horse.</P>

      <P>I concede I am not as knowledgeable as the Minister about the horse industry but I recall the time when Inis Cara was a showjumper rather than a racehorse.  As the Army Equitation School is undoubtedly a showcase for the horse industry &mdash; and I take on board his efforts to encourage the school to purchase Irish bred stock &mdash; is he satisfied sufficient top class stock is available and that there are enough incentives for breeders?  A number of Leader groups offered incentives to promote the industry and part of the 1994-99 structural funding programme made grant-aid available in that regard. However, as we plan for the next programme will he try to put in place measure to give breeders the financial incentive to develop the industry further?  He stated some of our best stock is exported but is there enough top quality stock in Ireland?  What can be done to follow the German example where the quality of horse improved <Col N="1561" /> from a low base to world class in the space of ten or 15 years?  Is that an angle to be looked at to increase the quantity of top class breeding stock available?</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's remarks and over a number of years we lost some of the best blood lines and young horses in the country.  We were left essentially with a small pool, primarily the King of Diamonds line.  In recent years a great deal of progress has been made by the Irish Horse Board co-operative under the direction of Dr. Noel Cawley.  Various incentives are given to retain blood lines, especially brood mare lines.  I am encouraged by recent results, for example, in Lanaken, Belgium, for young showjumpers where our teams did well.  Ireland has done relatively well in the Aga Khan Cup recently but the blood lines must be retained.</P>
      <P>Inis Cara has done well in recent times as a racehorse and I missed out badly a few weeks when a nice price was offered.  However, it was not for the want of good information in the corridors of Leinster House.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that some alternative enterprises which people were encouraged to take up have gone very wrong?  Will the Department introduce headage payments to alleviate the problems being experienced by, for example, deer farmers who were encouraged to take up such farming by the Minister, Deputy Walsh, the former Commissioner, Ray MacSharry and the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey?  Many of them now face bankruptcy. Will the Minister of State contact the banks in this regard?

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of Irish farms continue to be family farms.  According to the CSO's labour input survey, 149,300 out of a total of 149,500 farms in 1996 were family farms.  The proportion of people working in agriculture remains very high by EU standards.  A total of 301,000 people, including 287,200 family workers, work on farms on a regular basis, working the equivalent of 223,400 full-time jobs.</P>
      <P>It is true that the number of farms has declined in recent years, in line with the trend in all modern economies and industrialised countries.  The number of farms declined by 12,200, or 7.5 per cent, between 1992 and 1996.  However, 65 per cent of that reduction was accounted for by farms of less than ten hectares.  It must be acknowledged that in our thriving economy, other types of employment may prove more attractive to young people than a career in agriculture, especially on small uneconomic holdings.  The Government has committed itself in An Action Programme for the Millennium to &ldquo;ensure support for the maximum number of family farms&rdquo;. This commitment is being carried out through actions to maintain farm incomes and to encourage the early transfer of land to young trained farmers.</P>
      <P>In 1998, there will be an increase of 17 per cent, to more than £71 million, in funding for the farm retirement scheme.  The scheme's original target of 7,000 participants was met by December last year.  This scheme has made, and will continue to make, an important contribution towards encouraging the transfer of land to young trained farmers.</P>
      <P>There is a wide range of taxation incentives in place to encourage young people to enter farming. Full stock relief is available for young trained farmers for a period of four years after qualification. There is a reduction of two-thirds in the stamp duty payable on farm transfers to young farmers.  Other concessions in relation to capital acquisitions tax, probate tax, capital gains tax and land leasing are designed to encourage the early and orderly transfer of farms to the younger generation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the huge increase in direct payments to farmers in recent years has contributed to maintaining farm incomes and thus keeping people in farming who would otherwise have left. Direct cheques in the post payments to farmers in 1997 amounted to a record high of almost £941 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of Agenda 2000 one of my main objectives will be not only to protect farm incomes, but to seek to maximise the income of all farmers, particularly those on smaller farms, <Col N="1564" /> and to ensure that the appropriate structural measures are in place to support family farms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Both those questions will be taken later.  Many young people are leaving farming. Governments over the years have sought various ways to limit that exodus, but it has proved very difficult.  Everyone knows that if an older member of a family gets a job, a car, a girlfriend or boyfriend and can go on holidays to the Rose of Tralee, Lisdoonvarna or perhaps the Spice Girls concert, younger members of the family will want to do likewise.  Many young people go on to third level education, which is very desirable.  It is extremely difficult to retain young people on farms, but everything possible is being done under various programmes and schemes to target payments at particular farmers.</P>

I am pleased the Finance Bill provides for an increase from £20,000 to £30,000 that can be written off for farmers who have had expenditure under the control of farmyard pollution scheme.

However, we encouraged the Minister for Finance last year to provide <Col N="1565" /> additional moneys of £64 million in a supplementary estimate to cater for many of the applications under that scheme.  This week with my officials I will meet representatives of Macra na Feirme to draw up a new targeted scheme with a view to reintroducing the scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  It is essential to provide incentives to encourage young people to enter farming.</P>

      <P>On the farm retirement scheme what progress has been made in the enlargement clause and the income qualification criteria &mdash; two negative aspects which militate against a greater take-up of the scheme?  Will the pilot rural renewal scheme have taxation incentives? Given that the Minister for Finance did not refer to it in his Second Stage contribution on the Finance Bill I hope it will be provided for on Committee Stage.  Will the Minister urge his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide tax incentives to entice farmers to stay on the land?  Will he remove the anomaly in inter-farm leasing of the taxation implication for the transfer of farms from father to son or daughter that does not exist in non-farm related activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed the pilot rural renewal scheme with the Minister for Finance and asked if it could be extended to the south but I got a negative response.  However, the Minister is enthusiastic about the scheme and it is his intention to have it extended further.  It is a worthwhile pilot scheme and there will be tax incentives for people in all pilot areas.  If successful the scheme will be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to rural development generally, my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has set up an interdepartmental committee to produce a White Paper before the end of the year.  The first meeting of that interdepartmental committee took place this year.  Inputs from Members, organisations, rural communities and people concerned are welcome.  Some 7,000 people have availed of the farm retirement scheme and this has helped in getting younger people into the management of farms.  I recognised at an early stage because of my contact with farmers that the two elements which caused the difficulty were the enlargement clause and farm income.  I raised this matter with Commissioner Fischler from whom I hope to receive a positive response.  The initial reason for the enlargement clause was to consolidate holdings.  It has had the opposite effect &mdash; people in Cork have bought land in County Mayo, County Waterford and in other parts of the country and so on.  They do not want the land for the farm retirement scheme but they afforest or put it to some other use.  It is a cost and an impediment to the scheme and I hope to get a positive response from the Commissioner on that matter.  This makes a nonsense of keeping rural communities together.  If part-time farmers who work with the Office of Public Works, the county council or Coillte do not make more than <Col N="1566" /> 50 per cent of their income from farming it is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>Given that I do not have up to date information on inter-farm leasing I will certainly follow it up in a future Question Time.</P>

      <P>On the matter of the farm retirement scheme it is reported in today's issue of the <i>Irish Farmer's Journal</i> that the enlargement clause will be changed to a work units clause.  One of the problems with the installation aid scheme was that young people tried to increase the work units.  Will the Minister clarify whether the scheme will be based on work units or the enlargement clause, given that one is as difficult as the other?  Last week the Minister gave a commitment to reintroduce the installation aid scheme and suggested it will take a new format. Will that format be broader than the previous scheme and when will it be introduced? Will the grant be increased?  The IDA grant for the creation of a new job is £11,000 yet the installation aid scheme grant was only £5,600.</P>

There are leaks of the official paper but I do not have the Commission's proposals on Agenda 2000.  My understanding is that the new criteria will involve the viability of the farm and I am not sure whether it will be based on work units. However, I am aware of the difficulty which the labour units created for the scheme of installation aid for young farmers and I will seek to avoid those difficulties.  In relation to the scheme of installation aid for young farmers the first meeting took place with Macra na Feirme this week.  I hope agreement can be reached on the format of the new scheme in the next few weeks, to make it as attractive as possible for them.  Young farmers will have a major input into tailoring the scheme.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Gilmore &mdash; the arrangements between the Minister for Public Enterprise and Ryanair Limited regarding rent for the site occupied by the company at Dublin Airport; (2) Deputy McGinley &mdash; the urgency of approving a sewerage scheme for Burtonport, County Donegal and (3) Deputy Gregory &mdash; the need to change a statutory instrument, the 1985 Boundary Order, to enable Dublin Corporation to provide a school attendance officer for the Cherry Orchard area of Dublin 10 which suffers severe educational disadvantages.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by Deputies McGinley and Gilmore have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House for not being present this morning.  I had an official engagement with the National Training Centre for People with Disabilities.</P>
      <P>The story and controversy which has arisen in the past 24 hours is not new.  Financial journalists in all the main publications &mdash; Shane Ross, Nicholas Webb and Gene Kerrigan in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> Gerald Flynn in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and Siobhán Creighton in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; have been writing about this matter for several months.  Although Deputy Rabbitte and his party sat on their hands for a week before making a public statement, it came as no great surprise to me, the media or the parties which were members of the previous Government.  Deputy Owen acknowledged that she was aware of the problem. All the parties which were members of the previous Government were aware of it.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Department are determined to find a solution to what is a growing problem.  We have not yet decided what form the solution will take.  Three measures will, probably, have to be taken &mdash; reform of company law, reform of tax law and, perhaps, reform of the money laundering legislation.  There are a number of Departments, therefore, which will have to make changes to legislation.</P>
      <P>Allegations have been made that, in some sense, the Dáil was misled or information was concealed from it.  The following is the question put to me by Deputy McManus on 18 February:</P>
      <P>To ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the proposals, if any, she has for improvement to the procedures for registration and monitoring of companies, in view of the fact that up to 40,000 non-resident companies are registered here but hold no assets or carry out no trading in this State and some of these may be set up for the purpose of tax avoidance in other jurisdictions or criminal activities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>In response I said the Government was acutely aware of the problems that some Irish registered non-resident companies were giving rise to and of the urgent need to put measures in place to address these problems.  At no stage did I dispute the figure mentioned in the question and adduced by Deputy Rabbitte because we do not know what the figure is.  We have never sought to exaggerate or downplay it when various financial journalists have raised queries with the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked what procedures were being put in place for registration and monitoring of companies. I said there was a working group, the purpose of which was to come up with workable solutions to what was a difficult and complex issue.  I also said the Department was being assisted by the <Col N="1569" /> agencies under its aegis, that the &ldquo;thrust of whatever action is taken in the company law area will be aimed at a tightening up of the registration process consistent with avoiding the imposition of undue cost and administrative burdens on business at large&rdquo; and that we would &ldquo;respond swiftly to any reasonable proposals emerging&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said, &ldquo;the question asked for the number of companies involved in criminality and so on&rdquo;.  I was not asked for that information. If I had, the question would have been transferred to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Deputy is trying to rewrite history.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte did not become aware of this matter for the first time in the last few days.  As far back as 15 September 1995 the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, wrote to Deputy Rabbitte, then Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, to express his concern.  In the interests of accuracy I intend to publish both letters. Deputy Quinn said:</P>
    <P>However, in view of the fact that the tax measure which we have introduced can only be of limited effectiveness and that in the meantime the reputation of Ireland and that of the IFSC in particular is being compromised by the undesirable activities of certain IRNR companies, I would be grateful if you would give urgent consideration to accelerating the adoption of interim administrative measures aimed at curbing the misuse of this vehicle.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte did not respond for nine weeks. He said:</P>
    <P>As you know, the IRNR question will feature on the agenda of the next phase of the Company Law Review Group and it would be very inadvisable, in my view, to consider embarking on significant changes in the company law area until the CLRG has had an opportunity to fully examine the matter.</P>
    <P>That was reasonable but Deputy Rabbitte never called a meeting of the group to discuss the issue, although Deputy Quinn had informed him that it was urgent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte said that he had made great changes in the Companies Registration Office and sought Government permission to appoint an outsider to head the office.  He wondered why I, as the great champion of privatisation, did not appoint an outsider.  I did not do so for the following reason.  On 26 May 1997 a decision was made to appoint an excellent public servant, Mr. Paul Farrell, who was recalled from Brussels to take up the position.  He is doing an outstanding job.  Is Deputy Rabbitte suggesting that I should have dumped him?  I know what Deputy Rabbitte would have said if I had dumped him and brought in an outsider.  To highlight the hypocrisy on this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The letters and inaction speak for themselves.  Deputy Rabbitte refuted a comment made last night by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, that the file on this issue had been left unattended, and looked for an apology.  When the matter was first brought to his attention in September 1995 he did not ask the Company Law Review Group to meet and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If that does not amount to inaction, I do not know what does.  There is a problem and we have to address it in a way that will not damage the reputation of Ireland as an attractive place in which to invest or cut off options that bona fide companies operating here need to invest profits.  In some countries there is what is called participation privilege and in others the establishment of holding companies is allowed. The purpose is to ensure companies can move profits or investments without being subject to double taxation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe anyone would suggest legitimate companies creating 50 per cent of jobs in manufacturing and internationally traded services in this economy should be double taxed if they want to take their money out of the economy.  We want to find a vehicle that protects them but closes off the possibility of Ireland being used as a tax haven for those who do not want to pay tax &mdash; I have plenty of advertisements dating back years publishing that fact &mdash; or those who are using Ireland to launder money made from criminal activity or fraud.</P>
      <P>The challenge is a difficult one.  As I said earlier in relation to company law, we have to change tax law and we may have to change money laundering legislation.  If all those changes are required, the Government will not be found wanting in bringing about that change.  We regard this as urgent, damaging to the national interest and, in particular, the debate over the past 24 hours may have highlighted this issue in a way that may give the impression that all companies are engaged in this activity when clearly they are not.  The vast majority of companies operating in this jurisdiction, Irish or foreign, obey, honour and ensure the law is implemented and pay their taxes.  Our duty as a Government and Ministers is to ensure company law is enforced fairly across the board and that those who do business in and with Ireland know this is a country where laws are fairly enforced.  We intend to do that.  I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for being the first Minister with responsibility for commerce to set up a group within the Department to examine what changes we could make to company law to ensure it would be effective but would not place an undue burden on small to medium sized enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is missing the point of why we are here today.  We are not accusing her of not doing something about the IRNRs because a committee was set up to examine this matter.  Will she have the grace to accept that in her reply to a legitimate question raised by a Member she failed to purvey the nature of the note prepared for her to give her answer to that question?  In that way she failed to purvey any sense of the urgency required to deal with this matter or any sense that she was concerned about the fact that the reputation of the IFSC and this country was at stake.  Now that she has had a chance to reflect will she accept that the answer she gave was not in keeping with the note she had?  She said in her reply that among the proposals being considered are some in the company law area, but the note states that the company law section of her Department is recommending that IRNRs be abolished without any grant of exemption but allowing for a transition period. That is not merely tinkering around with company law, that note recommends their abolition. Will the Minister accept that she did not give full and open information on this matter, something she always expected when in Opposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I remind Deputy Owen that the question asks what plans she has for improvement to the procedures for registration and monitoring companies.  We have plans to do that, but we do not know their precise nature.  I said in my reply that the thrust of whatever action is taken in the company law area will be aimed at tightening up the registration process.  Although that has been recommended by some of the officials in the company law section, it may not be the way to proceed because it may damage bona fide companies operating in this jurisdiction.  We want to provide them with a vehicle, which exists in most other countries, to allow them to manage the money they are making in Ireland.  That is why we have not come down in favour of any particular option.  Non-residency is not a company categorisation. It is a tax issue.  There are issues that involve other Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the criminality aspect and so on.  That was not included in the question notwithstanding what Deputy Rabbitte said this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We never sought to dispute the extent of the problem.  Deputy McManus mentioned 40,000 companies, the newspapers speculated there are 40,000 companies, but we have never said that is or is not the figure because we do not know.  We have not sought to exaggerate or downplay that figure.  We have sought to find a solution and our energy and efforts will be put into finding one once and for all.  This matter is urgent and we acknowledged that, but it was also urgent when the Minister for Finance wrote to Deputy Rabbitte <Col N="1572" /> on 15 September 1995.  It is still urgent and the quicker we deal with this matter the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is patently obvious that the written reply which was intended to be given to the House conveys only a fraction of the information available to the Minister.  It is also very obvious that the tone was quite different.  We could spend the next 40 minutes beating the Tánaiste into an admission of that, but I do not expect her to admit that and it would probably be a waste of our time.  It is simply stating the obvious.  In so far as I can I want to be as constructive as possible.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will I have an opportunity to speak again as I wish to raise a few questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would prefer if the Deputy would confine himself to questions rather than statements so that all those who wish to ask questions will have an opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to do that.  Will the Tánaiste indicate what she regards as a legitimate use of an IRNR?  What is the legitimate purpose for which those companies are set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is used where a company doing business in Ireland wants to take its profits out of this country and invest them elsewhere without having to pay double taxation when it reinvests. It is to give such companies a legitimate vehicle with which to move their money.  It is a route through which companies move money.  In Holland and Belgium companies use a holding company mechanism and in other countries they use a participation privilege mechanism.  By virtue of that participation privilege they are not prone to double taxation.  It is important we do not place any restrictions on those companies which have made such an enormous contribution to our economic growth by investing in the economy and employing 50 per cent of those employed in manufacturing and internationally traded services, but at the same time we must close down the capacity for that mechanism to be used for illegitimate activity, money laundering or as a tax haven.  One of the options being considered is that we would link the companies that would use that vehicle for investment activity here with their domestic activity and that may be a way of avoiding damaging bona fide companies.  Another option is that we could close down the non-residency element for tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe this is controversial and I hope the Chair will indulge me as I am genuinely trying to elicit information.  I understand that in the case of the United States of America we have a double taxation agreement and an agreement in place which ensures this does not happen.  Most multinational corporations located here are of American parenthood. <Col N="1573" /> Am I right in assuming that argument would not apply to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the case.  There is also the question of paying tax on dividends made by those companies.  That is the only reason they use them.  They use them to manage their investment in a way that is tax efficient.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a question.  The Minister quoted selectively from the question.  She left out the last part which is included in virtually every question tabled to enable a Minister to give information which he or she considers important and of which the House may not be aware.  The phrase is: &ldquo;if she will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;.  This is common practice because Deputies know the Minister will have more information than they do, so in order to elicit that information they always ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter. That gives a Minister <i>carte blanche</i> to say what he or she chooses, but unfortunately this Minister chose not to give information.</P>

There has been concern about this matter for a considerable time and not just in Government circles or in the IFSC &mdash; many people have known about it.  The difficulty has been finding the correct mechanism with which to address it.  Deputy Quinn as Minister for Finance sought to address it in 1995 but he thought the measure would make only a minor difference. The last Government was aware of it, Deputy Quinn described it as urgent on 15 September 1995 and wrote to the then Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte to deal with it by way of company law.  It was not dealt with and has not been yet, but it will be.</P>

The big concern is to protect bona fide investors in the economy and if we can do that without imposing further burdens on the registration process for small and medium sized companies, we have the capacity to deal with it. We must find a way of dealing with the problem that does not throw the baby out with the bathwater.  The group established in the Department by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy &mdash; which includes the companies registration office, Forfás, the IDA and the company law division of the Department &mdash; will produce amendments to the company law which will deal with some aspects of the matter but there also must be changes to the tax code and perhaps to the money laundering legislation.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister asking us to believe that a question which states &ldquo;some of these may be set up for the purpose of tax avoidance in other jurisdictions or criminal activities; and if she will make a statement on the matter&rdquo; did not at the very least require her to say either that those companies were not being used for those activities, or that they were, as the memo states?  Is she prepared to admit that she did not fulfil the needs of the question by giving more information?</P>
      <P>When she went to Brussels with the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to discuss the level of corporation tax was she aware &mdash; and if not, should she not have been aware &mdash; that one of the reasons Ireland was in major difficulties about corporation tax levels was that our EU partners felt IFSC companies had the benefit of bringing inward investment into Ireland which was not going elsewhere?  If she was so aware, what information concerning these companies was discussed in Brussels?  If it was discussed, why did the Minister not imply more urgency and concern in her reply?  The reply was intended to get the matter dropped and the Minister hoped no one would come back on the matter.  The memo was the only way we would discover there was more information.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister know what type of criminal activity provided the funds for these accounts? Was it Russian or US Mafia money, did it come from South America or where did the criminal activity take place?  The memo stated that some of these companies have been found to engage in undesirable activities.  There has been general discussion about the use of legitimate companies for money laundering but does the Minister have specific information about specific companies in Ireland which have received money from this activity?</P>

      <P>The matter was not discussed in Brussels at the meeting she mentioned.  What was of concern in Brussels and among our fellow EU members is Ireland's 10 per cent corporate tax rate, by virtue of which many companies are attracted to Ireland.  The EU wants us to move to <Col N="1577" /> a standard low rate rather than a rate which is seen as a State aid, and that was the issue.</P>

      <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> recently, Siobhán Creighton wrote about a company which was being investigated by the Portuguese authorities and some of these companies have been the subject of articles in various publications. Which companies were involved in fraud is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda authorities, it is clearly not a matter for me.  I do not know how many such companies there are, which ones they are or the nature of the frauds.</P>
      <P>Our Department is concerned about closing off any existing loopholes in company law.  We do not have jurisdiction over other criminal or tax issues, which are matters for other Ministers.  We want to move forward on an agreed basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may well be the case that when the Government reaches some conclusions on this matter we will consult with the Opposition.  We are quite open to consultation with others.  There has been widespread consultation with outside parties, private interests and State bodies which are affected, such as the IDA and Forfás.  It is clearly not a question of trying to conceal or be secretive about these matters.  As I said, they have been <Col N="1578" /> the subject of numerous articles by financial journalists over a long number of months.</P>

Is it not the case that she sought to give the impression this morning that no information was concealed?  Is it not true she did not deal with the question of the criminal activity of some of these companies?

      <P>Is it not the case that the Tánaiste is the third Minister today to acknowledge the complexity of this issue?  No Member on this side of the House is disputing that.  The issue is why the House was treated in the fashion it was.  Why is the Tánaiste accusing me of accusing her of misleading the House when what I accused her of was concealing information?</P>
      <P>I now want to accuse her of misleading the House.  In respect of the appointment of an outsider and the information she has just given the House, is it not a fact that I took a memorandum to Cabinet on this issue and the other series of reforms I introduced in the Companies Office?  Is it not a fact that the Cabinet authorised my proposal to appoint a chief executive officer from outside on a contract basis at assistant secretary level?  Is it not the case that that person was designed to go in over the person whom the Tánaiste now uses as an excuse for not implementing my decision?  The person concerned, whom I put in when I moved someone else, was at principal officer level.  The chief executive was to go in at assistant secretary level. Is that not a fact?  Why does the Tánaiste seek to mislead the House about the decision I made?  I will come back then.</P>

      <P>I will take the last issue first.  It is true that provision was made in the Government decision for the appointment of an outsider if that was felt desirable.  However, it is also true that on 26 May 1997, one month before I became Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a decision was made to bring a civil servant home from Brussels to head up this office on a <i>pro tem</i> basis.  He is doing an outstanding job.  If I had dumped him and brought in an outsider Deputy Rabbitte would have been the first to criticise me.</P>

We do not make pre-announcements unless we have something to announce.  We have not decided what we are going to do.  When Deputy McManus asked what improvement was being made in the procedures we said that the thrust of whatever action is taken in the company law area will be aimed at tightening up the registration process, consistent with avoiding the imposition of undue cost and administrative burdens on business at large.

      <P>That has been the subject of discussion since 1995.  Deputy Quinn sought to address it in the 1995 Finance Bill.  As he said himself in the letter I quoted earlier, that would only have a minor impact and that he felt company law changes were also required.  That is what we are seeking to do to address it.  We will do it as quickly and as urgently as we can.  For the first time there is a group in the Department attached to the company law division who are looking at possible changes in company law to deal with that aspect.  However, it is a wide issue involving other Ministers with different responsibilities. We need to move on at least two fronts, if not three.  I assure the Deputy that the Government will move to close off this loophole as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am making precisely that point.  This problem has existed and has become particularly acute in recent years.  We will obviously deal with it today, but we must elucidate soon how exactly we will deal with it.</P>
      <P>In relation to the information provided to the House, I am advised that from 21 April next, when the Freedom of Information Act is implemented fully, that back-up information will be available as a matter of routine to people who request it.  Will the Minister make that backup information available as a matter of routine to the House from that time onwards?  On the substantive issue today, can I take it that the Tánaiste does not agree with the view expressed as being the corporate view of her Department in the back-up information, that effectively these IRNRs should be closed off by means of tax measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right.  Much of this information will be made available after April if persons affected or members of the public want to seek it.  I cannot give an undertaking to include everything that comes in a back-up briefing.  If I did that I would be accused of stonewalling at Question Time because there would be pages and pages of answers.  We seek to answer the questions we are asked and to deal with any other questions that arise by way of supplementary. Clearly we want to close off the loopholes, but we do not want to affect legitimate bona fide business that operates here.  We do not want to restrict the vehicle that legitimate foreign investment uses to efficiently manage their tax affairs. If we were to do that it would be very damaging to inward investment.  That is why the IDA has expressed such huge concern about the matter. Virtually all our European colleagues and most civilised countries provide some mechanism, by way of participation privilege or a holding company. It may well be that we will link this registration process to IDA activity and thereby close it off to everybody else.  Since we have not come to any conclusions in relation to that matter, I do not want to be definite in what I am saying.</P>
      <P>For our part, in regard to making changes in company law, we intend to tighten up the procedures to restrict the capacity to use this procedure to register illegitimate companies through Ireland and, as a result, to launder money and evade taxes in other jurisdictions.  We want to close off that loophole, and we want to find the most effective way across departments of doing that.  That will be done as quickly as possible.</P>

Why then does the Minister seek to give the impression that there was any delay involved here?  That opposition and head on difference of opinion on how this problem should be resolved is still extant.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>l thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State for being present in the House to respond.</P>
      <P>Burtonport, a fishing village on the west Donegal coast about four miles from Dungloe, has a population of approximately 300.  The economy of the village is primarily based on fishing, tourism and agriculture.  The harbour, which is one of the busiest in the country, specialises in white fish, though diversification into pelagic and nonquota species is being developed.  The three fish processing centres in the village employ several hundred people during the season.  Much of the development and activity is generated by the very active fishermen's co-operative.  The harbour is the terminal for the Arranmore ferry service and home port and base for approximately 60 fishing vessels which range in size from 40 feet to more than 60 feet in length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two and a half years ago Burtonport was selected by the International Fund for Ireland for funding under its fishing villages initiative.  Under <Col N="1588" /> this imaginative programme an exciting development is planned comprising a heritage centre, marina, industrial park in conjunction with Údarás na Gaeltachta and Donegal County Council, marine tourism centre with visitors facilities and, eventually, a state of the art aquarium. The campaign for this exciting development has been spearheaded by the very active progressive and effective Burtonport Development Association, Coiste Forbartha Ailt a' Chorrain.</P>
    <P>For many years sewage disposal facilities in Burtonport have been completely inadequate. The village depends on an old two foot by two foot stone dyke pipe underneath the road.  About 200 metres of this stone pipe runs level with the road and is continuously full.  The raw untreated overflow spills into the harbour.  In addition, there is the effluent from the fish processing enterprises.  The blend is polluting the entire harbour area and creating conditions that would be completely unacceptable in the remotest part of the world, let alone in a town like Burtonport which is a centre for tourism and fish processing in this area.</P>
    <P>The people of Burtonport have been campaigning and lobbying for many years for a modern up-to-date sewerage scheme.  At times, they were led to believe that a scheme was granted and approved.  Two years ago they were told that the proposals for Burtonport, together with those of Gweedore and Ardara, were submitted to the European Commission for funding under the Donegal Gaeltacht coastal area schemes. However, according to the latest available information Burtonport has once more been bypassed. Further development in the village is now severely curtailed due to the lack of such a basic infrastructural requirement as a sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P>There are many exciting developments envisaged for Burtonport in the future, for example, a harbour extension, dredging of the channel, the lFI project and an industrial park.  However, we are failing to provide the very basic requirement of a sewerage scheme.  During 1985-6 when the water mains were extended to Burtonport harbour arrangements were made to lay pipes under the new pier to provide an out-fall for the expected sewerage scheme.  The pipe is still there but the sewerage scheme has not materialised.</P>
    <P>As Burtonport no longer seems to be considered for Structural Funds under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services or the INTERREG 2 initiative, it is dependent on the national Exchequer for funding.  It is not a hugely expensive scheme &mdash; the estimated cost is in the region of £3 million.  Compared to other schemes it would be considered a small project. In the interests of the fishing industry, employment in the area, the tourism industry and the exciting development planned for Burtonport, I request the Minister to have a sympathetic look at this scheme and initiate the process that will allow it to commence and be brought to conclusion during his term in office.  If he does this <Col N="1589" /> he will always be remembered with kindness and gratitude by the people of Burtonport.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see Deputy Gilmore in the House as he became familiar with the difficulties in Burtonport during his time as Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGinley for raising this matter which is of great importance to his constituency.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is unable to be present in the House this evening and he has asked me to reply on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Given that it is a very important fishing port, ferry terminal and a resort town, the Minister is well aware of the concern to provide sewage treatment for Burtonport.  However, before dealing with this scheme it might be helpful to refer to the broader picture in relation to investment in water and sewerage services.</P>
      <P>The 1998 national water and sewerage investment programme, details of which were published earlier this month, is by far the largest in the history of the State.  Under the programme, investment in water and sewerage services will amount to approximately £185 million in the current year, representing an increase of just over 13 per cent on 1997 and a 50 per cent increase on the 1996 figure.  This unprecedented level of funding clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to improving the country's environmental infrastructure and to meeting the existing and projected needs arising from residential, economic and other development.  The investment programme for 1998 will enable construction to begin on 61 major public schemes, with a final estimated value of more than £470 million.</P>
      <P>County Donegal is a large beneficiary of this substantial level of investment.  Schemes under way account for an investment of well over £30 million.  They will have a major impact in removing existing development constraints and provide the necessary infrastructure to support tourism and other economic sectors.  This includes the Pollan Dam water supply, Bundoran sewerage, the Donegal water conservation project and the Ballybofey-Stranoralar sewerage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from these the 1998 investment programme will allow for planning sewerage schemes at Letterkenny, Donegal town, Bundoran, Ballyshannon, Rossnowlagh, Killybegs, Gweedore and Carndonagh, and the Letterkenny water scheme. <Col N="1590" /> All these schemes have a completion value of about £57 million.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the specific matter raised by the Deputy, Cohesion Funding was sought for the Burtonport sewerage scheme under an application for assistance for Gaeltacht areas sewerage schemes in County Donegal.  Unfortunately, approval has not been forthcoming and the prospects of funding under the current Cohesion Fund are not good.  Until such time as a source of funding can be identified it would not be appropriate to allow Donegal County Council to proceed any further with planning the Burtonport scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will agree that County Donegal is getting its fair share of the available funding, and Burtonport will be kept in mind if additional funding becomes available to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for permitting me to raise this matter.  I appreciate that the Minister has come into the House to respond.</P>
      <P>The prospectus which was issued by Ryanair at the time of its flotation states:</P>
      <P>Since 1992, Ryanair Limited has rented its corporate headquarters at Dublin Airport from Darley Investments Limited (&ldquo;Darley') at an annual rental of £200,000 per annum.  Darley developed the site at Dublin Airport under a 30 year licence on land from Ireland's Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. Ryanair Limited provided loan facilities to Darley to develop the site.  From the period of its incorporation (1988) to 31 March 1996 the share capital of Darley was held by CDS Trust, a trust established for the benefit of C. M. Ryan, D. F. Ryan, S. T. Ryan and their children. Darley became a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair Limited during the year ended 31 March 1996.  The building is included in fixed assets in the consolidated balance sheet at a net book value of £1,330,000.  The annual rental payable by the group to the Minister is £192,000, but payment of the rent is suspended for the first 12 years of the agreement and Darley will receive a 50 per cent rebate on the rent for six years thereafter.</P>
      <P>This was a remarkable sweetheart deal between the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the &ldquo;round robin&rdquo; circle of companies in the Ryanair family.  Irrespective of who built the Ryanair building or what will happen the building after the 30 years, the fact remains that Ryanair got a 30 year licence on a valuable State owned site at Dublin Airport, the company has it rent free for 12 years and at half rent for six years, and the deal amounts to a £3 million subsidy from the Irish taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to publish the terms and text of the agreement which was made in 1992.  Who <Col N="1591" /> proposed the arrangement?  Who approved it? What advice did the then Minister get on this deal?  Did the then Minister seek the opinion of the Valuation Office, and what was its view?  This site belongs to the people who have a right to know the precise basis on which Ryanair has subsidised use of it until 2010.</P>
    <P>The issue of the Ryanair site, taken with the information which the Minister has already given to the House about valuable rebates worth £12 million which were made available to Ryanair, raises serious questions about the relationship between the State and Ryanair since its foundation. Ryanair has always pretended &mdash; even in its advertising today &mdash; that it is the little airline pitted against the might of the State.  It is now gradually emerging that Ryanair has received considerable assistance from the State in direct payment and in kind.  It is in the public's interest to know the full extent of all State assistance to Ryanair.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to have conducted and to publish an audit of all State aid of any kind to Ryanair.  In particular, I ask her to publish the promotional assistance, in cash or in kind, which has been provided to Ryanair, and to publish if Ryanair has been provided with preferential arrangements at Pier A in Dublin Airport and if this resulted from a departmental or ministerial instruction.  I also want to know the full details of all ministerial and departmental instructions given to Aer Rianta to assist Ryanair over the years.</P>
    <P>I ask for this information because Ryanair, in its dispute with its baggage handlers, has adopted a particularly dismissive attitude to the State's institutions, and it is behaving recklessly towards the social partnership on which the country's collective economic well-being is based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully in agreement on the Deputy's sentiments about the full and open publication of all matters as the present dispute is destructive, disturbing and demeaning to all concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to state the facts surrounding the arrangements made in 1991 in relation to Ryanair's headquarters at Dublin Airport between the then Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and Ryanair, through the offices of Aer Rianta, as the Minister's agent in managing the State airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts are as follows.  In the early 1990s Ryanair sought relocation of its head office from its accommodation in the city centre to Dublin Airport.  Aer Rianta agreed to provide Ryanair <Col N="1592" />&mdash; in the form of Darley Investments Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ryanair &mdash; with a site adjacent to the cargo terminal subject to the following conditions: that all construction costs were to be borne by Ryanair; the annual upkeep and maintenance costs were to be borne by Ryanair; ownership of the building was to be vested in the Minister on completion of the construction; and the site and building thereon were to be provided by the Minister on a 30 year lease to Ryanair and subject to no rent in years one to 12, 50 per cent of full rental value in years 13 to 18 and 100 per cent of full rental value in years 19 to 30.</P>
    <P>The base rent for the building in 1992 was calculated at £192,000.  Under the agreement the rent payable in 2004 will be 50 per cent of the full market value at that time.  Full market rent will apply from 2010 for the duration of the lease.</P>
    <P>The Ryanair head office building was occupied by Ryanair in 1992.  On expiry of the lease, Ryanair will surrender to the Minister full and vacant possession of the site and building in good and substantial repair.</P>
    <P>The 12 year moratorium on rent, plus the subsequent 6 year 50 per cent rent rebate, reflected the fact that Ryanair constructed the building at its own expense and transferred it, for no consideration, to the then Minister, and that Ryanair also incurs the annual upkeep and maintenance costs associated with the building.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has assured me this type of financial arrangement in respect of accommodation for its customers at the State airport has been employed in other cases.  I have the documentation relating to other airlines, but we are dealing with Ryanair in this instance.  Ryanair has assured me this is an equally valid commercial arrangement, from the point of view of Aer Rianta and the Minister, as against the alternative arrangement of Aer Rianta providing such accommodation at its own cost and recovering such cost through annual rents over a lease period. Aer Rianta believes the agreement with Ryanair, which was vetted by Aer Rianta's legal and financial advisers and by the office of the Chief State Solicitor, represents a commercially sound arrangement from the point of view of the State.</P>
    <P>Ryanair sought approval from Aer Rianta for the construction of a large engine and maintenance facility in 1996.  As a first step it was agreed between Aer Rianta and Ryanair that Ryanair would redevelop the existing hangar facility that it uses at its own cost of £450,000.  Site rental of £5,000 is currently being received by Aer Rianta in respect of this site.  In May 1997, the chief executive of Aer Rianta approved a proposal to redevelop the site, including the refurbished hangar, at an overall cost of £1.5 million to be borne by Ryanair. The funding and lease arrangements would be on a similar basis to those applying to its existing headquarters.  Work on this facility has not yet commenced pending final agreement between Aer Rianta and Ryanair.  I have letters appertaining <Col N="1593" /> to that.  The 1996-97 arrangement was modelled on that of 1991-92.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Ryanair to avail of the offer of the Labour Court in relation to the ongoing dispute involving baggage handlers.  The stance of Ryanair in refusing to use the State labour reconciliation services is both disturbing and ultimately destructive.</P>
    <P>I will make public all the details, memoranda, letters and ministerial recommendations relating to the two arrangements.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 126 of 17 February 1998, genetically engineered crops have considerable potential for the production of safer and cheaper food.  Genetically modified organisms have been used extensively in the production of food and food ingredients in some countries.</P>
      <P>This Department has no direct function in this matter.  Essentially, the question of trials for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.  That body is charged with ensuring that the trials abide by all the EU legislative requirements.  The conditions under which food and food ingredients from genetically engineered crops are sold is a matter for the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>Product development research is ongoing world-wide, including limited field trials of genetically modified sugar beet plants in this country. Pending the outcome of the development research stage on new products, it would be inappropriate to come to any conclusions on their possible future use for food or feed purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of public concern regarding genetically modified products, their development and use should be carefully monitored and should proceed on a precautionary basis in the best interests of both consumers and the environment.</P>
      <P>European Union legislation concerning the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment for development research purposes and, in appropriate cases, the subsequent placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients, are implemented at national level by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Children respectively.</P>

    <P>The number of TB reactors disclosed in 1997 was 28,647 of which 8,650 or 30.2 per cent showed visible lesions at slaughter.  However, I must emphasise that the absence of visible lesions in the other reactor animals does not mean that the disease was not present in these animals.</P>
    <P>In 1997, £14.6 million in compensation was paid to farmers in respect of bovine TB by way of reactor grants, depopulation grants and income supplement.  An additional £0.704 million was paid to herdowners under the hardship grant scheme resulting from TB and/or brucellosis breakdowns between 1996 and 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 18 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apples are covered under an EU common organisation of the market and are in surplus in the Community.  Accordingly, we are precluded from aiding the planting of new orchards.  Producers <Col N="1598" /> have benefited from grant-aid for storage, grading and specialised equipment under a number of co-funded schemes operated by my Department.  Under the provisions of Council Regulation 2200/97 a once off premium can be paid for the grubbing up of 10,000 hectares of apple and pear orchards.  The surface area to which this applies has been apportioned between member states on the basis of the orchard area, protection and withdrawals of each member state. Apple production in Ireland represents 0.07 per cent of Community production.  It follows from our very low level of production that we will receive only a very small proportion of funding for any other scheme that the Community might introduce.</P>
    <P>In addition I am seeking European Commission approval to make payments out of a fund, established for the purpose, to producers whose viability has been threatened by adverse weather conditions during 1997.</P>

      <P>It is generally acceptable that the 1992 reform was beneficial to the vast majority of Irish beef producers, who received a substantial increase in premium payments following the reform.  I accept that drystock producers have experienced difficulties in recent years because of the reduction in cattle prices arising from the BSE scares of 1996.  However, substantial sums of money were paid to beef producers in 1996 and 1997 to compensate them for the reduction in prices both as a result of the 1996 BSE scare and the revaluation of the Irish Green Pound in 1997. Drystock producers received a substantial proportion of these payments through a top-up of the special beef premium and the deseasonalisation premium.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has published outline proposals for the reform of the beef regime as part of Agenda 2000.  These proposals are oriented towards reduced support prices and a greater emphasis on direct payment to producers. It is expected that the Commission will come forward with more detailed proposals towards the end of next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU beef regime has traditionally focused intervention support on male cattle and income support through the premium system on male cattle and suckler cows.  The rationale for this approach is that the removal of appropriate quantities of male beef from the market through intervention purchasing should be sufficient to maintain prices for all cattle, including heifers, at reasonable levels.  In addition, premium payments on suckler cows and male cattle are designed to compensate producers for the reduction in prices for all cattle following the 1992 reform of the beef regime.</P>
      <P>These arrangements have worked reasonably well up to the present.  However, I am concerned about the implications of the outline Santer proposals for the continued viability of heifer-beef production.  For that reason, I have raised at the Council of Agriculture Ministers &mdash; and I have made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler &mdash; that appropriate provision needs to be made in the detailed proposals to ensure that heifer-beef production will continue to be economically viable under the reformed regime.  I believe that the EU Commission has an understanding of the problem. Detailed proposals are expected to be adopted and published by the Commission towards the end of next month.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The position following the mid term review of the Structural Funds is that an extra £20 million in public funds was allocated to the scheme for the control of farm pollution, while an additional £8.5 million was allocated to the dairy hygiene scheme.  The existing allocation was insufficient because of the high level of demand under both measures.  In addition £10 million and £2.7 million was made available from national Exchequer funds in last year's Supplementary Estimate for the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes, respectively, to enable grants maturing in 1997 to be paid by the end of last year.</P>
      <P>While the additional allocations will go a long way towards meeting existing commitments they are insufficient to allow the reopening of either scheme.  However, I will continue to monitor closely the progress of other large scale projects in the CSF as a whole to see if savings are likely to be identified in any area which would enable us to reintroduce both schemes, albeit in modified form.</P>

      <P>In the 1997 supplementary budget an additional £1.5 million was granted to meet the shortfall in funding for the scheme to the year end.  In addition an extra £3.5 million was provided in the budget from the national Exchequer to enable my Department to process the remaining valid applications which had been received in the Department when the scheme was suspended. The question of applications which had not been submited by 7 August 1997 due to technical deficiencies, including full registration of title, is currently the subject of discussion with interested parties.</P>

      <P>I recognise the importance attached to the scheme of installation-aid by young farmers which was suspended when the funding available under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry was exhausted.  Additional funding has been provided by the Exchequer to clear matured liabilities under the scheme.  I am committed to the reintroduction of a revised scheme targeted towards smaller farmers.  My Department is currently in the process of drawing up such a scheme.</P>
      <P>This process will involve consultations with the farming organisations to enable their views to be taken into account in drawing up the revised scheme.  When this has been completed the revised scheme will then require the approval of the Department of Finance and the EU Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Under the new measures which I announced on 26 February 1998 to address the serious brucellosis position in the country, the following arrangements will apply to combat the disease.</P>
      <P>From 23 February 1998 all female cattle and bulls over 12 months of age being moved into or out of holdings &mdash; other than direct to a slaughter premises &mdash; must have passed a blood test within 30 days preceding the date of movement.  From the same date, bulls over 12 months and female cattle over 18 months of age may not be sold more than once, whether by public or private sale on foot of a brucellosis test, and such cattle being sold must be moved from the holding where tests are undertaken direct to either the purchaser's holding or direct to a mart and from there direct to the purchaser's holding.  There will be a full round of blood testing for all eligible cattle in 1998 to augment and complement existing arrangements including monthly milk ring testing and further enhancement of the eradication measures applying in areas with a high incidence, including areas in County Limerick, and in particular the completion of a full round of blood testing of all eligible animals in these areas over the next two months.  Revamped administrative procedures will be implemented in my Department's local offices to deal more effectively with herds with brucellosis reactors and those contiguous to such herds.</P>
      <P>Arrangements will be put in place to speed up the completion of blood tests, the improved notification of results, the early removal of reactors and steps will be taken to improve detection of irregularities.</P>
      <P>Increased epidemiology work will be carried out by my Department's veterinary staff and a review of the epidemiology of brucellosis over recent years by the investigation unit headed by Professor Dan Collins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an ongoing and intensive awareness-advisory campaign to update farmers and others on farm husbandry and management practices to curtail the spread of brucellosis, the early introduction of further legislation on aspects <Col N="1603" /> relating to trading and tracing of cattle movements, and on registration of all those engaged in cattle trading and a restructured and revamped compensation regime.</P>
    <P>These additional measures which I have introduced following consultation with the Animal Health Forum are essential to redress the deteriorating situation in relation to brucellosis and to protect human and animal health and our trading status in relation to livestock and livestock products. I am satisfied following discussions in the Animal Health Forum that all concerned &mdash; farmers, the veterinary profession and marts &mdash; will co-operate fully with my Department to ensure that the comprehensive range of measures now in place will help to bring about a reduction in the level of brucellosis and the eventual eradication of the disease from the national herd.</P>
    <P>As regards depopulations, it should be borne in mind that these involve the removal to slaughter of cattle which have not reacted under the standard tests.  The present voluntary arrangements operate satisfactorily except in a small number of cases generally where herdowners are not saitisfied with the compensation arrangements available.  While I do not currently have plans to introduce legislation to provide for the compulsory depopulation of herds, this is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>It is a priority for me to ensure that any BSE related trade restrictions inhibiting the export of Irish beef are removed.  Considerable progress has been made in this regard with most international markets now open to Irish beef.  Every effort will continue to be made, including when necessary and appropriate my direct involvement, until any remaining restrictions are lifted.  As regards expansion of markets, this is a matter for the industry itself and An Bord Bia which is statutorily responsible for promoting, assisting and developing the marketing of Irish food and drink. I am concerned that the BSE related market renationalisation tendency in European countries has left the Irish beef industry overly reliant on volatile and vulnerable third country markets. The progressive liberalisation of world trade makes it all the more important that our beef trade is refocused towards sustainable high value markets within the European Union.  Accordingly, I have requested Bord Bia to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a detailed and costed marketing initiative to assist the industry in recovering and expanding market share in the European Union while retaining our position as a leading exporter to international markets.</P>
      <P>As regards food products generally, Bord Bia has in place a comprehensive market development strategy.  Results for 1997 show an overall growth in food and drink exports of over 3 per cent to £4.9 billion, with significant increases in prepared consumer foods, drinks and dairy sectors.</P>

      <P>The cattle artificial insemination (AI) service in Ireland is regulated by the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Act, 1947, and the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Regulations, 1948. Under this legislation a person may not distribute or sell bull semen or practice the artificial insemination of cattle except under and in accordance with a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has licensed 13 semen trading companies to sell and distribute bull semen.  Eight AI organisations have been licensed to provide an AI field service and AI technicians employed by these organisations to deliver the service to farmers have been approved by my Department. Individual farmers have also been licensed to <Col N="1607" /> carry out artificial insemination of cattle in their own herds only.  Through this structure the artificial insemination in each case may be performed using semen from any of the licensed AI service organisations or licensed semen trading companies provided the semen satisfies all the necessary animal health and zootechnical requirements laid down in legislation and licence conditions.</P>
    <P>The system for licensing AI service organisations under the 1947 Act is under review in my Department.  However, in view of the veterinary and zootechnical control considerations involved, it is not intended to allow each AI technician to provide an independent semen sales and AI service. It is envisaged that, for the foreseeable future, it will be in the best interest of the cattle breeding industry for such services to be provided by organisations with all the necessary resources to ensure an effectively controlled and comprehensive quality service.</P>

      <P>The EU decision of 27 March 1996 which introduced a complete prohibition on the export of cattle from the United Kingdom was implemented in this country by regulations adopted on 28 March 1996.  These regulations contain a wide range of powers including penalties of up to 12 months' imprisonment and fines of up to £1,000.  A large-scale surveillance operation has been put in place to ensure that animals are not smuggled across the Border.  To date, 1,436 animals have been seized since the entry into force of the EU prohibition, of which 919 have been destroyed.  The remaining animals have either been released or are still detained pending further investigations.  Increased surveillance is also in place at factories to ensure that smuggled animals are not presented for slaughter. My Department maintains a permanent veterinary presence at all export plants and identity cards and tags are checked to ensure that there has been no attempt at forgery or &ldquo;laundering&rdquo; of animals.  Close contact is also maintained with the authorities in Northern Ireland on the matter. All the relevant authorities here are determined to enforce the ban while it remains in force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 51, 69 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at developments in the UK market where most of the UK retail multiples have decided not to source beef originating outside Britain for the duration of a British beef promotion campaign recently launched by the Meat and Livestock Commission.  The problem is being addressed at a number of levels.  As an immediate response, I asked Bord Bia to intensify direct contact with British retailers and provide a detailed analysis of the situation in that market. In addition, I arranged to meet senior management of the major UK retail chains and I have liaised closely with farm organisations and beef exporters.  Meetings took place in Dublin the week before last with representatives of the largest UK multiple, and on Monday last I travelled to London to meet senior management of all the major UK multiples.  The purpose of my involvement was to stress the seriousness with which the Government views these developments and to seek a return to normal trade in beef.  I was assured at the meetings of the long-term future for Irish beef on the UK retail market and that the retailers will continue contacts with Irish exporters with the objective of restoring normal trading arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> In the meantime, at my request, Bord Bia is preparing a detailed strategy to defend our traditional place on the UK and other EU beef markets. At a political level, the Taoiseach has already brought to the attention of the British Prime Minister the problems lack of access to the UK market are causing our beef industry and I have had the full support of my Government colleagues in this matter.  I am also using all appropriate contacts at EU level to express our concerns about the campaign in the UK, the effects of which are contrary to the spirit of free trade and the single market.</P>
    <P>I believe, however the solution to the present difficulties lies in working with the UK retailers who, while sensitive to the particular problems facing UK farmers, nevertheless recognise the quality of the product we offer and the commitment of our beef industry to supplying the UK market.  Combined with a renewed and intensified promotional effort, this approach is the most effective way of enabling Irish beef exports retain and ultimately expand market share in the UK. This matter will continue to receive priority attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new measures to combat brucellosis which I introduced from 23 February 1998 arrangements are being made to speed up the completion of blood tests and the notification of results to the herdowner.  In this regard and with the co-operation of all concerned it is envisaged that test results will be available in seven to nine days following the taking of the sample.  As heretofore, and for the immediate future blood samples will be tested at the brucellosis laboratory in Cork and to a limited extent at the regional laboratory in Sligo.  Taking account of the additional workload on the laboratories and <Col N="1613" /> particularly in Cork where the bulk of the blood tests will be carried out my Department has sought additional resouces for the Cork laboratory. The other regional veterinary laboratories of my Department are not involved in brucellosis blood testing.</P>
      <P>As in the past, the farmer will pay for the cost of the pre-movement test and my Department will carry the laboratory costs.  The rate paid by farmers to veterinary practitioners in respect of taking blood samples is a matter for negotiation between them and I have no function in this regard.  However, in recognition of the extra costs involved to the farmer by pre-movement and other required blood testing in 1998 I will seek Oireachtas approval to reduce the current rates of disease levies by the equivalent of £2 million per year to partially offset these additional costs. On such approval, these levies will be reduced from £2.50 to £2 a head for cattle slaughtered or exported and from 0.5p to 0.4p per gallon on milk deliveries.</P>

      <P>There are no BSE payments delayed due to computer processing errors in my Department. The vast bulk of BSE payments outstanding at this stage are top-up payments to those farmers who had more animals qualifying for the suckler cow and special beef premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.  The position is that the EU regulations governing payment of BSE top-ups, which were paid in October 1996, provided for top-up payments in respect of animals qualifying for the 1995 suckler cow premium and special beef premium. The EU require that the top-up payments should be based on the 1995 schemes in order that the payments could be made as early as possible and before the EU financial year deadline of 15 October 1996.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for the suckler cow and special beef premium in 1996.  Money was to be recouped from those farmers who were overpaid compensation on the grounds that they had fewer animals qualifying for the premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.  Money so recouped was to form a pool of money from which further top-up payments are to be made to those farmers who had more animals qualifying for the premium in 1996 than they had in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1614" /> My Department has been in the process of recovering overpayments from those farmers in the former category and this money is to be used to make the outstanding payments to farmers in the latter category.  Obviously it is important that as much money as possible can be recovered before striking a rate for payment of additional top-ups.  It is expected that payments of the outstanding amounts due will be made in the period May-June 1998.</P>
    <P>Additionally, a small number of beef producers are due BSE compensation payments arising from the package of measures worth some £30.54 million to Ireland's beef farmers and which was to be paid by the EU deadline of 15 October 1997.  By that deadline a small number of producers had failed to establish eligibility and these cases are being finalised.</P>

      <P>The Leader programme is administered by approved local action groups who implement business plans which they themselves have drawn up for the development of their areas.  The allocation of funding to eligible horticultural projects is a matter for the groups.  Up to now small scale innovative horticultural investments which are not fundable under other programmes or schemes may be grant aided under Leader.  As the funding for horticulture under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99 has been fully committed, my Department will be reviewing the eligibility rules under Leader with the European Commission.  The 1994-1999 Bord Glas Development Plan sets output targets for the production of horticultural produce based on the opportunities for growth in the industry.  The aim of the plan is to increase domestic output by £56 million to increase market share for domestic produce and to reduce the overall level of imports where practical.</P>

      <P>While prices over the past two years in the sheep sector generally have been at record levels, it is the case that in recent months, prices for hoggets and cull ewes have been relatively low.  This is due to a large extent on the overhang of lamb in the market and in particular the UK.</P>
      <P>The ewe premium is designed to compensate producers for the difference between the EU basic price and the average EU market price for sheepmeat.  In view of this, it is inevitable that the rate of the ewe premium will be low in a year such as 1997, when average market prices are high.  Unfortunately, the ewe premium is not capable of compensating individual producers or categories of producers for lower than the average price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> The EU sheepmeat regime recognises the position of the hill sheep farmer through the payment of a supplementary rural world premium of £5.51 on eligible ewes to producers in disadvantaged areas, where all hill sheep farmers are located.  In addition, these producers also received a headage payment of £10 per head on the first 200 eweshoggets under the disadvantaged area scheme. Towards the end of 1997 I sanctioned an additional £2.5 million in extra headage payments to assist sheep producers in disadvantaged areas. These supplementary payments are assigned to compensate hill sheep farmers for the lower prices they receive on the market.</P>
    <P>I have established a forum, representative of the industry as a whole to examine the wider challenges facing the sector including the production and marketing patterns best suited to our conditions.</P>

For the purposes of the EU arable area aid system, payment of aid is limited to a national base area which to date has not been exceeded in this country. It is open to any person to produce arable crops, that is, cereals and certain other crops &mdash; and to claim area aid, provided that the crops in question are grown on eligible land, whether owned or rented.  Eligible land is land which was tilled between 1 January 1987 and 31 December 1991 other than for reseeding to grass.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a request for a meeting from the unions with memberhsip in the Irish Fertiliser Industries, or IFI, plant in the State.  I welcome the opportunity which this meeting will provide to review global developments in the fertiliser industry and their impact on IFI's operations and to hear the unions elaborate on their position in this regard.</P>
      <P>The group of unions requested the meeting last week against the background of the recent decision by Imperial Chemical Industries, ICI, to dispose of its fertiliser interests in the UK to the US based Terra Group.  ICI remains a 49 per cent shareholder in Irish Fertilizer Industries IFI, with the State, through Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta, or NET, owning the remaining 51 per cent.  I met the Chairman of IFI, Mr. Niall Welch before Christmas and was briefed on the ICI sale.  The ICI shareholding in IFI was not part of the sale negotiations and I understand that Terra did not express an interest in the ICI shareholding in IFI.</P>
      <P>I will attend the forthcoming annual general meeting of Irish Fertiliser Industries Limited in Belfast on 6 March and will avail of the opportunity to ascertain ICI's future intentions towards their shareholding in IFI.  I will then be in a better position to assess the options available to the State.</P>

      <P>To date over 32,350 farmers have joined REPS with payments totalling some £195.5 million. As a result over 1.1 million hectares of agricultural land, which represents approximately 23 per cent of the total area, are being farmed in an environmentally friendly way.  It is envisaged that up to 43,000 farmers will have joined REPS by 1999 with expected total expenditure in the order of £350 million.  The sum of £145 million has been made available for payments under the scheme this year.  This is an increase of 43 per cent on last year's allocation and reflects my continued confidence in the scheme.</P>
      <P>At present the scheme is being amended to incorporate provisions for special areas of conservation. Discussions with the European Commission are continuing and it is hoped to get agreement soon.</P>
      <P>It is the intention to continue the REPS for a further period after the initial five year period is completed in 1999.  It is expected that REPS will continue to play a major role in the implementation of environmental measures in Ireland and will be an appropriate channel for Community funding in future years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Producer prices are largely determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy and one of the most important factors affecting future prospects for farming is the imminent reform of that policy.  It has been accepted by the Council of Agriculture Ministers and by the European <Col N="1623" /> Council in Luxembourg last December that reform on the broad lines of the proposals in Agenda 2000 is necessary to allow the sector to be developed on a sound and sustainable basis, to make agriculture more competitive on world markets and to meet the needs of enlargement of the EU.  Clearly the stakes are high in the detailed negotiations, which will begin after the presentation of the Commission's full proposals at the end of March, and I will spare no effort in working for the best possible outcome for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Apart from the larger issues arising in the Santer package, of more immediate concern are developments in the EU beef market and in particular in the UK.  The BSE related market renationalisation tendency in European countries has left the Irish beef industry overly reliant on volatile and vulnerable third country markets. The progressive liberalisaion of world trade makes it all the more important that our beef trade is refocused towards the sustainable high value markets within the European Union. Accordingly, in addition to taking direct action in relation to the difficulties in the UK market I have requested Bord Bia to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a detailed and costed marketing initiative to assist the industry in recovering and expanding market share in the European Union while retaining our position as a leading exporter to international markets.</P>

      <P>Due to the very low incidence of BSE in Ireland, the precautionary measures in place and effectiveness of our animal health controls, it has been possible to provide the assurances required to enable trade in beef to continue to most of our international markets, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, UEA, Kuwait, Bahrain and Algeria. Indeed, exports of Irish beef to Egypt almost doubled last year.  Agreement has recently been reached on veterinary certification with Qatar which will enable trade to resume.  Negotiations are continuing with Oman and I hope this market will also be reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iran is one of the few remaining traditionally important markets banning Irish beef.  The recent restoration of diplomatic relations with that country facilitated the resumption of discussions with the Iranian authorities to have the ban on imports of Irish beef lifted.  A veterinary delegation from my Department travelled to Teheran three weeks ago for this purpose.  Additional information was supplied to the Iranian veterinary authorities and they accepted an invitation to continue discussions <Col N="1624" /> in Ireland.  Every effort will be made to convince the Iranian authorities of the safety and quality of Irish beef so that trade can resume.</P>

The scheme provides financial assistance to the employer towards the cost of adapting premises or equipment for use by employees with a disability. In certain instances a word processor would be considered as an adaptation.  The maximum grant available is £5,000.  The 1998 budget for this scheme is currently being finalised by my Department with the NRB.</P>
      <P>The provision of aids and applicances, including word processors and other technology for personal use by persons with disabilities, is a matter for health boards.  In November 1997, £4.325 million was made available from savings in the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to voluntary agencies working with people with physical and sensory disabilities, for individuals, for the purchase of aids and applicances, including technology.  This was in addition to the ongoing resources allocated by health boards for aids and appliances each year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>Designations under the new urban renewal scheme which is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998 will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.  Guidelines for the new scheme set out the criteria which local authorities are asked to use in the selection of areas for integrated area plans and provide guidance on the content of these plans.  A copy of these guidelines is available in the Library.</P>
      <P>Taking account of the guidelines, it is a matter for Dublin Corporation to decide on the areas in Dublin city for which integrated area plans are to be prepared.  Widespread consultation with local partners and participation by local communities is a vital part of the plan preparation process.  The specified deadline for the submission of plans to my Department is 31 March next.  A broadly based expert advisory panel which I established last year will assess the integerated area plans when received and make recommendations to me in relation to the designation of areas for tax incentives.</P>
      <P>If and when an integrated area plan is submitted by Dublin Corporation in respect of the Inchicore area, the Deputy can be assured that it will be carefully assessed by reference to the established criteria under the process which I have established.  As an integrated area plan for this area has not, as yet, been submitted by the corporation, the question of a meeting as referred to in the question does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the draft EU framework water directive as presented by the European commission is to protect and improve the quality of waters in the Community and to address quantity considerations to ensure sustainable use.  The proposal includes ambitious environmental objectives which are to be pursued on the basis of programmes of measures for river basins.  Programmes must achieve a level of protection at least equivalent to that provided under relevant existing Directives, including Directive 76/464/EEC on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment and Directive 80/68/EEC on the protection of groundwater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal reflects a recognition of the need for greater coherence in Community legislation on water and seeks to provide a framework within which water quality and quantity issues can be pursued in a more effective and integrated manner.  It will complement other Directives such as those covering integrated pollution prevention and control, drinking water, urban waste water treatment and protection of waters against pollution caused by agriculture and bathing water quality.  In formulating the proposal, the Commission identified scope to rationalise certain <Col N="1632" /> aspects of Community legislation on water and accordingly incorporated key elements of existing legislation in the draft framework.  The intention is that the Directives concerned, such as Directives 76/464/EEC and 80/68/EEC, will eventually be repealed.  However, this will not be done until programmes of measures for river basins, prepared so as to at least achieve the quality objectives established under the Directives to be repealed, are in place.</P>
    <P>The framework proposal also provides for the review of water quality standards and emission controls and enables the Commission to bring forward proposals for revised or new requirements.</P>
    <P>I support the incorporation of ambitious environmental objectives in the framework Directive proposal and consider that the approach envisaged should provide an effective guard against any weakening of the water quality objectives contained in existing Directives.</P>
    <P>Further elaboration of the basis for the Commission's proposal, including clarification of the relationship between the framework Directive and other water Directives which will continue to remain in force, as well as the manner in which Directives identified for repeal will be catered for, is provided in the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Commission's proposal as published in February 1997.  A copy of the memorandum, together with other relevant documentation, including the Irish position on the proposals, is contained in &ldquo;Commission Proposal for a Council Directive Establishing a Framework for Community Action in the Field of Water Policy &mdash; Main Background Documents and Events Concerning Commission Preparation of Proposal&rdquo;, copy of which is available in the Library.</P>

At the time it was estimated that this <Col N="1633" /> new scheme would, at any given time, provide for the needs of about 3,000 people who were incapable of work and who were in receipt of SWA, with some 13,500 people benefiting in the course of a full year.  However, recent trends would indicate that the number of potential beneficiaries would now be somewhat lower, due mainly to a larger than anticipated move of claimants from SWA to disability allowance.</P>
    <P>It was originally envisaged that the sickness allowance scheme would commence in 1997. However, it has been found that the level of computer systems development work which would be required to introduce this scheme is such that it could jeopardise the critical work which is necessary in order to ensure that all of the Department's computer based payments systems are fully prepared for the year 2000.  In the circumstances, it has been necessary to defer the introduction of the sickness allowance scheme.  The position will be reviewed later this year in the light of progress on the year 2000 preparations.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out, however, that all those who would have qualified for the sickness allowance payment are currently being catered for through other social welfare payments, such as supplementary welfare allowance, and are not therefore losing out financially as a result of the deferred implementation.</P>

    <P>I assume the Deputy is referring in his question to the Interdepartmental Committee on the Islands, the Gaeltacht and the Irish Language.  All Government Departments have been requested <Col N="1634" /> to nominate representative(s) on this committee but I have not yet received all nominations.  It is intended that this committee will co-ordinate the implementation of the Government's policy with regard to the offshore islands, the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  The committee was established to assist my Department in seeking to ensure that Government policy in relation to the islands, the Irish language and the Gaeltacht is implemented in a co-ordinated and effective manner.  The terms of reference of the committee have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>Government policy on island development is outlined on page 22 of An Action Programme for the Millennium and is based on the position paper on the islands prepared by me before the last general election.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>if she will give a detailed report on the EC project under Cohesion Funding to conserve and restore a number of Irish raised bogs; and when the completed works may be inspected.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>Raised bogs are considered a priority habitat under the EU habitats directive, and Ireland has the best remaining examples of this habitat type in western Europe.</P>
      <P>The European Commission recognised the importance of conserving this habitat type and consequently approved a project under the Cohesion Fund aimed at conserving and restoring a number of Irish raised bogs.  The total cost of the project is 2.5 million ECU, of which 85 per cent is refundable by the EU.</P>
      <P>Following an initial survey and subsequent consultations with the EU, a number of raised bogs were selected for inclusion in the project, all of which are proposed SACs.  Those selected represent a cross section of the range of variation of this habitat in Ireland.  They are situated in Counties Galway, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Tipperary and Westmeath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project involves a combination of land acquisition, drain blocking, dam construction work and monitoring.  Land acquisition is necessary before work can commence and to date over 800 hectares of raised bog have been acquired under the project with the agreement of the former <Col N="1636" /> owners.  The planning and design phase determines what works need to be carried out on site in order to conserve the bog.  In many cases this requires site investigation and research work.</P>
    <P>Conservation and restoration work usually involves the blocking of existing drains on the bog surface, or the construction of peat dams on the periphery of the bogs to prevent excessive water loss due to drying out and shrinkage in the bog margins.  Drain blocking is carried out either by hand or by machine, depending on the depth and width of the drains in question.  Peat dams are constructed where drain blocking is not sufficient to prevent the bogs from drying out.  Monitoring is carried out to evaluate the changes which occur to the ecology and hydrology of the bogs following completion of the works.</P>
    <P>The project was commenced in 1994.  A considerable amount of work has already been carried out and the project is on course to be completed by the end of this year.  The following is a summary of progress to date:</P>
    <P>Lisnageeragh Bog, County Galway: Over 190 hectares of this bog have been acquired.  Drain blocking is in progress and will be completed this Summer.</P>
    <P>Fisherstown, County Longford: A number of plots adjoining the State-owned area have been acquired.</P>
    <P>Clara Bog, County Offaly (Nature Reserve): A site of approximately 36 hectares adjoining the nature reserve has been acquired.  An extensive programme of drain blocking by hand is ongoing and is due to be completed later this year.  A contract to block a series of larger drains by machine has been completed.</P>
    <P>Raheenmore Bog, Co. Offaly (Nature Reserve): A series of dams have been constructed on the north-east and south-east margins of the bog.  A further dam on the north-west margin is in course of construction and is due to be completed this summer.</P>
    <P>Aharavogue Bog, County Offaly: Drain blocking by machine has been carried out.  The construction of a small peat dam and some works to the bog margins are due to be undertaken this summer.</P>
    <P>Ballinagare Bog, County Roscommon: A number of small plots adjoining the existing State owned area have been acquired.  Blocking of an extensive network of drains is largely complete. Some additional works will be carried out this spring.</P>
    <P>Carrowbehy Bog, County Roscommon: A number of small plots adjoining the existing State owned area have been acquired.</P>
    <P>Ballyduff Bog, County Tipperary: A number of small plots have been acquired.</P>
    <P>Clonfinane Bog, County Tipperary: A number of plots have been acquired and a drain blocking contract has been completed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> Firville Bog, County Tipperary: A number of plots have been acquired.</P>
    <P>Garriskill Bog, County Westmeath: A number of plots adjoining the existing State-owned lands have been acquired.  A contract to block drains by machine will be completed this summer.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this dealing refers to an application under section 49 &mdash; i.e. Acquisition of Title by virtue of long possession &mdash; of the Registration of Titles Act, 1964, and a Transfer of Part.  I understand that due to their complicated nature, applications under section 49, which require detailed examination of the applicant's claim for registration as owner, take some time to process.</P>
      <P>I am further informed that notice will shortly be served on all parties whose interests may be affected by the application in so far as such parties can be identified.  If no objections are received within one month the case will be considered for completion.  The Deputy may wish to note that the Transfer of Part cannot be processed until the section 49 application is completed.</P>

      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has noted that technology can play a major role in helping people with disabilities to secure equal status in most areas of life and society.  It considered the present system of delivering assistive technology to people with disabilities to be inadequate and recommended that the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Department of Public Enterprise introduce legislation to ensure access to assistive technology, including financial access.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has demonstrated in many practical ways its commitment to promoting independence and community integration for people <Col N="1640" /> with disabilities.  In this context, in the latter part of 1997, it was possible to deliver a package of measures, costing £4.325 million, which will enhance the opportunities for people with disabilities to achieve independent living and community integration.  This package included an additional grant of £50,000 paid to the Irish Council of People with Disabilities for computer equipment for their county networks.  The equipment will be used, <i>inter alia</i>, in the training programmes it will provide under the Horizon project.</P>

In accordance with the terms of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, it is necessary for the Secretary General of my Department to submit to me the strategy statement for the Department <Col N="1642" /> within six months after the coming into operation of this Act &mdash; namely 1 September 1997.  Thus, the strategy statement must be presented to me before 1 March 1998.  Also, having regard to the legislation, the strategy statement must, with or without amendment by me, be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by 1 May next.  I anticipate, therefore, that the strategy statement will be available publicly shortly afterwards.</P>

The outcome of the forum will provide an important input into policy decisions on the future development of pre-school education services, including services for children with special education needs.</P>

      <P>Students pursuing post-graduate courses at approved colleges in Northern Ireland can apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance under the higher education grants scheme.  The student support schemes were extended, with effect from 1996-7 academic year, to provide maintenance grants to students following full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in another EU member state. The course must be followed in a university or third level insitution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds. Certain courses are excluded, such as courses in subject areas which are subject to quotas on <Col N="1643" /> places and courses in private commercial colleges. However, due to limited resources there is no provision under the current student support schemes for funding for postgraduate studies outside of Ireland.</P>
