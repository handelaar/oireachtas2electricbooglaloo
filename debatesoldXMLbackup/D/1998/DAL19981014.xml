      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I must deal with a postponed division relating to the suspension of a Member. Yesterday, on the question that Deputy Connaughton be suspended from the service of the Dáil, a division was claimed.  In accordance with Standing Order 61 that division must be taken now.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two matters.  Does the Taoiseach agree the situation faced by the farming community is an urgent matter of public importance?  In view of statements made yesterday by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners to the Committee of Public Accounts, which suggested that there was, at policy level, a measure of comprehension of the problems of the banks in respect of possible capital flight and, therefore, a comprehending view being taken of depositors who are allegedly non-resident, does the Taoiseach agree it is important the Minister for Finance or one of his officials should explain to the committee what was the stated knowledge, if any, in the Department of Finance of the policy considerations pursued by it in 1990 and 1991 regarding tax settlements from the point of view of bank solvency?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first question with which the Minister for Finance will deal this afternoon covers that matter.  However, as stated yesterday, the Government will provide any assistance or co-operation required by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Government will also try to co-operate with any requests received from the chairman of the committee.</P>
      <P>I accept that difficult circumstances obtain at present in the agriculture industry.  This matter was debated in the House last week, the Government and the Minister for Agriculture and Food spent a considerable amount of time discussing it yesterday and we are attempting, on a daily basis, to assist in alleviating the problems faced by those involved in agriculture.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised that matter yesterday and we have given it consideration overnight.  The Government has no difficulty with the intent of the motion.  However, we wish to consider the legal ramifications involved to ensure that whatever assistance we can provide to the committee is assistance it requires which is legally correct.  As far as the intent of the motion is concerned, the Government has no difficulty with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. We accept that an amendment to section 5(1)(f) of the Compellability of Witnesses Act, 1997, is probably required to investigate taxation matters. Do I understand from the Taoiseach's reply that the Government, through the Whips, is prepared to discuss a motion acceptable to all sides of the House so that the committee can do the work the public wants it to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I acknowledge the work being done by the committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Jim Mitchell.  The committee has taken the initiative and has already interviewed the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners. I understand senior AIB executives will appear before the committee tomorrow.  I appreciate that somewhere along the line the committee's powers will prove inadequate because section 5(1)(f) of the Compellability of Witnesses Act, which involves the exemption of certain evidence, excludes the taxation issue and relates to information kept for the purposes of assessing the liability of a person in respect of a tax, duty or other payment.  It is patently obvious that the committee could encounter difficulties somewhere along the line.  I would like to take action on this matter in conjunction with the committee in the first instance.  However, I take the point that its work may be hampered and we will be obliged to address that issue.</P>

      <P>In respect of yesterday's evidence from the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners where he attributed responsibility to this House for the inability of the commissioners to cope with tax evasion transactions which occurred in 1991 and 1992, were specific policy matters in that regard brought to the attention of the Taoiseach who was then Minister for Finance?

      <P>I wish to raise two matters on promised legislation.  Is the wildlife Bill, which we were promised would be introduced in the autumn, still on track and when will it be published? With regard to the fundraising for charitable and other purposes Bill, which was the subject of an Adjournment debate last evening, will the Taoiseach state if, to assist the debate in advance of the Bill's publication, a compendium of the organisations which benefit from charitable status will be published?  The previous Government published such a compendium in respect of organisations which benefitted from lottery grants.  Would it be possible to publish the compendium before publishing the Bill?  When will the Bill be published and will it be of assistance that the Costello report in 1990 provided a draft of such a Bill?</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: During the summer the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform engaged in a great deal of sabre-rattling regarding the need for legislation to deal with white collar crime.  We were repeatedly informed that the criminal justice Bill on fraud offences would be brought forward as a matter of priority this term. The Bill does not appear on the schedule for this term and we have been informed it will not be published before mid-1999, which means it could appear at any time during the next millennium. In view of the major scandals at NIB and AIB &mdash; two of the biggest banks in the country &mdash; involving bogus accounts, tax evasion and tax avoidance, why has the legislation not been given priority?</P>

      <P>Deputy Richard Bruton is in possession.  He is replying to the debate on amendments Nos. 57 and 58 which were discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that he was not willing to accept amendments Nos. 57 and 58 on the grounds that, while he recognised serious defects in provision particularly for children with special needs, recognised that the Department was taking statutory obligations in <Col N="279" /> this area and saw the need perhaps further down the road for some mechanism for asserting the rights of parents, he seemed to indicate that he was not willing to include it in the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, the only major legislation which we will see dealing with education on a broad base for the rest of this decade.  I would regard it as wholly unacceptable and certainly not in the spirit of partnership in education for the Minister to deny a right of appeal to parents in respect of crucial issues in relation to education provision. It is somewhat ironic to find that the Minister is willing to grant to parents a right of appeal in respect of the activities of a school but he is not willing to grant them the same right of appeal in respect of the activities of the Minister and other agencies of the Department.  I would contend that the main problems of parents are not with the school in the first instance; they are essentially problems with the level of provision to the school to allow it to provide the adequate and appropriate education for children.  To deny access to an appeals mechanism for parents and others in respect of crucial things, such as whether the Department is meeting its statutory obligation to provide appropriate education and whether it is meeting its constitutional obligation to provide free primary education, leaves a huge gap in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is an element of hypocrisy about the talk of partnership in education.  It is like the story in &ldquo;Animal Farm&rdquo;.  When the pigs developed their taste for power they changed the slogan from &ldquo;four legs good, two legs bad&rdquo; to &ldquo;four legs good, two legs better&rdquo; and reinstated themselves as two legged rulers of the farm.  The same is true of the attitude to parents in the education system.  We talk of the importance of the role of parents but when it comes to granting them the normal rights that a citizen would expect from Government provisions, we deny them.  By contrast, the ESB, FÁS, and the Eastern Health Board have complaints commissioners.  Similarly, the Ombudsman operates for administrative issues, but in what goes to the heart of provision for well over one million children in our education system, the Minister will not allow an appeals mechanism over areas for which he has responsibility, such as the issue of adequate provision.  He is, however, prepared to allow such a mechanism for complaints about teachers in the classroom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the Minister's argument, nor do I accept that while he sees merit in my proposals, he may at some stage provide an appeals mechanism that will look at the needs of children with special needs.  We debated this matter on Committee Stage.  These amendments are not a surprise <Col N="280" /> to the Minister.  It was well flagged that this was an issue of considerable concern to the House and that we wanted an appeal mechanism to go beyond the present school based provisions. It is unacceptable for the Minister to indicate at this stage that while he sees merit in our proposal he will not include it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This is our last chance to propose changes to this legislation.  Its provisions will be set for a lengthy period.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to attempt to palm us off with expressions of good will, no doubt sincerely meant.  They will not have proper statutory effect until they are underpinned by legislation.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister suggested that the Ombudsman could play a role.  We know the Ombudsman is not qualified to make an assessment on whether a child with a special education need is getting the appropriate level of service to which he ought to be entitled.  That is not the task of the Ombudsman.  He does not enter into policy issues.  He deals with maladministration and can at times encroach on things that are grossly unfair.  Indeed, he has brought to the attention of the Dáil extraordinary provisions and there have been changes as a consequence.  I commend him for that.  However, for the Minister to suggest that the need for a proper appeal mechanism for parents in respect of the education system can be dealt with through the Ombudsman's Office is to short change the House on this issue.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 57 is an important issue of principle.  The Minister must think again.  I understand he will introduce the Bill to the Seanad.  He may need time to incorporate an amendment of this kind, which he could then introduce in the Seanad.  However, I will not accept that we operate on the basis that the Minister will at some stage see fit to introduce something.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" />&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall direct each local authority to establish and education welfare committee with such number of education welfare officers as may be prescribed, to co-ordinate the statutory and other agencies concerned with the welfare of children in their functional area.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment gives a further function to the Minister for Education and Science and strikes at the heart of the major fault of this Bill, which is the lack of local or regional structures in the administration of education.  I have advanced the argument more than once during this debate that the Department remains a monolith in the face of the concept of subsidiarity which we voted for in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties.  The Minister is setting his face against any real development of partnership in the education system.</P>
    <P>Last week I quoted from the report of the special review group on education and the following was of great interest to the House:</P>
    <P>Following consultation with interested parties, the Government shall establish administrative structures throughout the country and they should have responsibility for co-ordination of services to students with disabilities and/or other education needs in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has chosen to disregard that.  This amendment seeks the introduction of an education welfare committee in each local authority area.  Obviously the composition of these committees is important in terms of their effectiveness. One useful model was suggested by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; that a senior official from the various statutory and non-statutory agencies which deal with dysfunctional children would be part of this committee.</P>
    <P>However, the essence of the committee would be that parents can share responsibility for their children if they are failing in their parental duties, whether they are incompetent or neglectful, if their children are not benefiting from education and their social development and behaviour patterns are leading to a wasted life.  The problem is that children behaving dysfunctionally in school are not benefiting from education and are minimising the potential benefit to other children.</P>
    <P>There are various support agencies but no one has final or statutory responsibility.  The education welfare officer could call other agencies to book and ask what has been done for a child and if a successful plan is being implemented.  We are fooling ourselves if we do not do something of this nature.  The Minister has not disputed that discipline is deteroriating in schools and the system is in denial.  Schools will not broadcast their difficulties because it undermines confidence in them and they are often in competition with each other for pupils.  The usual problems arise at the end of each school year in terms of retention numbers and the demographic dividend.</P>
    <P>Society and the Department are not facing up <Col N="284" /> to this problem.  I have already presented my arguments as regards the appalling fact that there is an onus on the boards of management of schools to inform the Department when there is an expulsion.  I made suggestions about this last week to which the Minister did not respond.  This can be resolved without recourse to legislation.  It is appropriate and necessary, and more importantly, is in the interest of children at risk, the better operation of schools and the good of society at large.  Ministers do not lose anything by responding positively in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the school attendance legislation will resolve these problems.  Is that an appropriate title for the legislation the Minister intends to introduce?  Using the word &ldquo;attendance&rdquo; gives it a narrow focus.  The problem with the children I wish to cater for by introducing this amendment is often what they do in school rather than absenteeism.  The Minister has shown no inclination to look at local and regional structures.  He referred to county fora which would effectively be for consultation purposes. However, in the context of this amendment and this debate, the Minister should give a solid commitment of his intentions to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>This is the most important legislation which has come before the House during my tenure.  The Minister has a problem in that I repeat certain arguments.  However, I will continue to repeat them because there is a fundamental flaw in this legislation which should be properly addressed, specifically in terms of this amendment.  Many dysfunctional children can be identified before they start school or at an early stage at school. How can the principal, teachers or board of management of a school intervene when they become aware that a child is on the road to nowhere in circumstances where the parents are unable to cope?  Health boards, local authorities and voluntary agencies provide support, including finance on a weekly basis, but they act independently of each other.  As schools are not in the position to co-ordinate their activities, the officer concerned should have the power to act.  The earlier children with special needs are identified, including those with an intellectual, physical or sensory disability, those suffering from educational disadvantage and those who are gifted, the more successful we will be.</P>
    <P>The schemes in operation do not extend to a sufficient number of schools.  Because of the lack of a proper schools psychological service parents are being forced to avail of the services of psychologists in the private sector to have conditions such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and attention deficit disorder diagnosed.  This is alarming and wrong. A psychological assessment should be made at the time of entry to school and at two year intervals thereafter.  This is not primarily a matter for the Department of Education and Science.  I am aware of a 13 year old who has finally been diagnosed as dyslexic.  That is an appalling commentary on the system. <Col N="285" /> There are a number of centres to which parents can go to have their child assessed.  In general, however, schools should have the capacity to make the required assessments to identify all the children who need special attention.  Tomorrow I will meet distraught parents who contacted me earlier this week about the diagnosis which has finally been made in the case of their children.  In some health boards the psychological assessment is made by a clinical psychologist as opposed to an educational psychologist.  This means that it does not have the same value.  If we continue as we are, the position will continue to worsen.  It is appalling that, because of the lack of proper support services, the principal, teachers and board of management of a school do not know the underlying causes of a child's behavioural pattern.</P>
    <P>Children who fail at school for social and environmental reasons are also being neglected. Because of the lack of co-ordination of State support services results are not as good as they should be.  The Department of Education and Science should give a lead by adopting a holistic approach and providing the support families need.  Parents should be taught how to handle various situations.  On a radio programme on Monday a mother described her experiences with her child who was being bullied at school.  She felt guilty because she had failed to recognise what was happening and did not react in the best way at various times.  That is true of all parents.  Parents who have not had the benefit of substantial education may have to deal with a child who requires very advanced parenting skills.  This is the context in which I tabled my amendment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to close his mind to the idea of partnership at a local level.  Sometimes parents are seen as a necessary evil but the Minister is one of those who know this is not the case. Parents are a great resource and they must be involved in the education system at a more fundamental level than the Bill allows.  Mechanisms can be found for the establishment of education welfare committees although this may require an extensive election process.  The base from which parents are drawn for membership of committees is sometimes too narrow but partnership is fundamental to the system I propose.  It would involve people of competence, ability and commitment from the various sectors deciding on necessary supportive actions, dealing with individual cases through the education welfare officers and putting support programmes in place.  Some of these programmes could continue for a number of years and not all cases will be successfully resolved but unless we take a holistic approach to solving difficulties this problem &mdash; the worst one we face in the education system &mdash; will not be solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to establish an education welfare committee in each local authority area to co-ordinate the statutory and other agencies in dealing with the welfare of children within that area.  It is a welcome amendment <Col N="286" /> and deserves serious consideration.  Our education welfare service is administered under the old School Attendance Act some of whose provisions are antiquated.  The penalty imposed by the Act, for example, is a £5 fine and there are many serious weakness in its legislative development. Most significantly, for five out of six pupils in the country there is neither a school attendance nor an education welfare service.  This amendment seeks to fill that gap by establishing in every county an education welfare committee and officers charged with responsibility for school attendance and with the wider issues surroundiing non-attendance.  The amendment is desirable and worthwhile because it underlines this huge gap in education welfare services for people who run the risk of dropping out of school and who need more than a school with conventional services can offer.</P>
      <P>The amendment also seeks to co-ordinate various bodies.  Many attempts to address school attendance issues are bedevilled by the lack of structures to bring together Garda juvenile liaison officers, health board officers, school attendance officers and so on.  Added value can be achieved without additional resources by co-ordinating the work of these bodies.  The amendment seeks to do that at county level.  It is not essential that this be done at county level.  In some cases, for example in County Dublin, the sub-county level might be more appropriate.  The idea of establishing co-operation across bodies who, although they have a bearing on school performance, currently operate independently is very clear.  I am encouraged to see the development of loose coalitions of such groups, often centred around individual schools, but this development is on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and is not underpinned by any legislative provision.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister will say his education welfare Bill is a major priority in the Department.  However, it has slid repeatedly in the ranks of priority published in the House and we wonder when the Bill will see the light of day. The Taoiseach has, on several occasions, drawn our attention to magnificent new research and developments of concepts and provisions being undertaken in the Department and we await those provisions with interest.  However, I hazard a guess that the Bill, for which heads were drawn up by the previous Government, will not make a dramatic improvement.  The main change will be a response to the Minister's decision not to establish regional education boards which were at the heart of the previous Government's approach.</P>
      <P>The amendment raises important issues and I hope it commends itself to the Minister in some form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment which would not achieve the progress which Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Bruton suggest.  It states that the Minister shall direct each local authority to establish an education welfare committee.  The Minister does not have the <Col N="287" /> authority to direct local authorities to establish such committees.  I am not convinced that an education welfare committee established under the auspices of a local authority is the best vehicle to deal with the issues highlighted by the Deputies. I am equally concerned about those issues and equally committed to advancing solutions to them but the mechanism proposed in the amendment is flawed.  The mere establishment of such committees will not solve these problems.  Further-more, local authorities are undergoing considerable change in terms of their committee structures and of their liaison with community groups and the amendment does not dovetail with the developments in local government reform.</P>
      <P>My strategy for dealing with school absences, under-performance and educational disadvantage is to bring a number of inputs together.  On coming to office I commissioned a steering committee on the establishment of a national educational psychological service which I believe will be critical in dealing with the issues I have mentioned. The steering committee produced a concise report with clear recommendations in terms of establishing a national educational psychological service board, which would be at one remove from the Department and which would have as its sole function the provision of educational psychological services to schools as well as advising schools on developing policies.  It also recommended that another 131 psychologists would be required over the next five years to meet the needs of the system and give a meaningful response to the needs of students both at primary and secondary level.</P>
      <P>The home-school liaison service is particularly important in terms of early school leaving and the involvement of parents with schools, particularly in areas where there is significant educational disadvantage. For some reason that escapes me, the previous Government did not pursue on a consistent basis the home-school liaison service.  The service was established in 1991 by the then Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and where it has existed it has been a success.  My aim is to ensure that by next September every disadvantaged primary school will have a home-school liaison teacher.  It is regrettable that we are not in the position today in which every school has a home-school liaison teacher because that is important in terms of linking parents to the issues that surround early school leaving, poor retention figures in certain areas and difficulties children may be experiencing with the school system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We intend to publish an education (school attendance) and welfare service Bill.  Many of the issues Deputy O'Shea outlined in terms of early school leaving, children experiencing difficulty or the co-ordination of agencies &mdash; that there would have to be a person or a board to co-ordinate the various agencies in the interests of the child's educational welfare &mdash; will be addressed in the <Col N="288" /> Bill we intend to publish.  The Cabinet has approved the heads of the Bill and it is now with the draftsman's office.  We are pursuing that matter with speed.  Issues such as the obligation on schools to keep records of suspensions and expulsions and identify children experiencing difficulty at an early age will be covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not envisage that the school attendance and welfare service will be located in local authorities; it is better that it be developed in an educational context and that welfare officers would be both the catalysts for the co-ordination of the service but also the protagonists on behalf of the child.  They will assist the child to remain in school.  It is not just about a punitive approach to children who do not attend school but identifying the underlying problems that have led to poor attendance.  We must try to intervene effectively with new programmes to assist the child to remain in school.</P>
    <P>I am committed to partnership in education at local level.  One of the best innovations I have witnessed recently is the area partnerships throughout the country.  The education subcommittees of those area partnerships provide a good model of area partnership, not just between parents and educational interests but between the wider community and educational interests.  The concept of the area partnerships is driven by economic and employment regeneration of an area and it is interesting that almost all the partners in these area partnerships identify education as a critical factor in terms of the social and economic regeneration of an area.  That is a model I am anxious to promote because some area partnerships have done much good work for education and for schools.</P>
    <P>We had a long debate on Second and Committee Stages on the merits or demerits of the regional boards system.  As Deputies know, I am against the establishment of regional boards and I said that during the general election campaign before I came to office.  I am not disposed to reintroducing the concept of regional education boards in legislation because in many ways that concept put a stop to a great deal of progress.  We spent two or three years debating these boards and in the meantime an educational psychological service or school attendance service was not put in place.  Many other issues were pushed into the background while this panacea for all our ills, namely, regional education boards was to come via legislation.  The stock reply I received to numerous parliamentary questions on the matter was that this service would be introduced once the regional education boards were established.  I want more direct intervention.  I am moving forward in terms of a psychological and school attendance service and other areas such as home-school liaison and remedial teachers which will have a real impact on a child in difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, Deputy, but I do not believe other speakers want to come in again.  As we have a large number of amendments to be discussed, perhaps the Deputy might conclude the debate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A point made by the Minister in his reply concerning the Minister directing a local authority brings us back to the lack of a permanent education structure either at local or regional level.  There are precedents in the local authority system, for instance, the school attendance committees and the vocational education committees set up by the local authorities.  The concept, therefore, is not an alien one.  I drafted the amendment in its current form because there was no other local structure I could dovetail into in terms of advancing the concept.</P>
      <P>Some of the points the Minister made on the provisions he envisages are welcome but when we talk about area partnerships, Leader projects, etc., we must remember that they involve a whole plethora of organisations.  I am seeking a clear focus on education welfare.  Did I understand the Minister correctly that the school attendance Bill will have a longer title?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is the working title.  I take the Deputy's point on that.  There will be a longer title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to be welcomed but is there not a case for regionalising that structure? If we do not have representation from the local area, we will not address the problems in the holistic way that is necessary.  There are various aspects involved in that.  Plans can be developed but the implementation of those plans is another matter when we are talking about bringing various support services into play.  For example, the parental background may require urgent and ongoing attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is going part of the way towards what I am seeking but no <Col N="290" /> argument he has presented convinces me in any way that the deficit can be overcome because there are no local or regional structures.  The Minister said this had been going on for three years but it has been going on since the 1980s when the then Minister, Mrs. Hussey presented her proposals for the LEC system.  I recall that Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party were not quite as strong as the present Minister in their opposition to regional or local structures.  I suspect in some cases the line he is following may not be the line others might have followed.  That is speculation, however, not fact.</P>
    <P>The sub-committees of the area partnerships in education can do good work but they are like the curate's egg to an extent &mdash; some are good and some not so good.</P>
    <P>As regards the employment of a home-school liaison teacher in all the schools which are designated disadvantaged, we all know there are many schools not designated disadvantaged which are more disadvantaged than schools with that designation. Various Ministers have applied different criteria in an attempt to address that problem but have not been successful.  To employ home-school liaison teachers in all of those schools is welcome but it is not comprehensive enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The structure to continue does not come from that.  In a school it can be only a few students who require attention.  There will not be a home-school liaison teacher in every school and the same problems will arise as have arisen with remedial teachers in smaller schools; there can be problems in smaller schools.  I am looking for a comprehensive structure which addresses the difficulties I have described.</P>
      <P>These committees would also have a useful role in special education because there are many factors in terms of support for parents which could be improved when a child is identified as having an intellectual disability.  In some cases that disability is visible from birth but not in all cases.</P>
      <P>In general terms I welcome the Minister's proposals as progressive but I believe that they do not go nearly far enough and regretfully I will have to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 11, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.  -The parents of a child who has been referred by a school, a medical doctor or other specified person for an assessment of special education needs shall be entitled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to receive an assessment of the child's educational needs by a suitable person designated by the Minister, who shall arrange that the parents and other relevant persons shall be consulted throughout the assessment and that the parents shall receive information to guide their educational choices,</P>
      <P>(b) to receive a copy of a statement containing a description of any special educational needs identified, of the special education provision and support services which are necessary for the child and a proposed education plan for the child, drawn up in consultation with the parents concerned, and</P>
      <P>(c) to have that statement entered on to a national database of educational needs, maintained by the Minister to assist in the proper planning and provision of such services in accordance with <i>section 7.</i>&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage which sought to set out the rights and entitlements <Col N="293" /> of parents and students in regard to the education system.  While it did not commend itself to the Minister, I will not reopen the argument. At the time I considered it added to the Bill.  The Minister argued that if one looked through the Bill it contained statements which constituted a similar bill of rights.</P>
    <P>In this amendment I want to focus on children who have special education needs.  I am seeking to provide that the parent of a child who has been referred by a school, doctor or other specified person for an assessment of special education needs shall be entitled to receive such an assessment, a copy of a statement containing a description of any special educational needs identified in the assessment and of the special education provision identified as being necessary for the child and that the statement of needs be provided to the Minister of Education to form a national database of needs in relation to children with special needs.</P>
    <P>The background to this matter is the special education committee review.  I do not have the longevity in education that others may have but that review appears to have been the last serious look at this area.  The number of assessments carried out was extraordinarily low, given the number of pupils referred for assessment.  Sometimes there were long waiting lists and on other occasions there was a refusal to participate.  As many as one in four children with special education needs in an eight year cycle had not been assessed &mdash; no detail was given of waiting times but the implication was that they were extremely long.  The Minister may say this has improved since the appointment of the additional psychologists but we do not know that.  If I tabled a parliamentary question to ask for the number of children awaiting assessment, he would reply that such information is not kept because waiting lists are not maintained by the psychological service, that it attends according to need.  In other words, his response would be similar to that given by the Minister for Health about hospital waiting lists until a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The current Minister is seeking and getting plaudits for recognising that waiting lists are a serious matter and need to be properly analysed. However, the same is not yet true as regards children with special educational needs and it is important that the penny should drop.  People should have this as of right, not as a result of a faceless person deciding that a case is urgent, with no waiting lists being maintained.</P>
    <P>It was extraordinary that it took a review group in 1993 to establish what Ministers over many years had said was a major priority.  Similar information is not updated on a year to year basis so we do not know the numbers &mdash; every response to questions about the number of children in the primary sector with special educational needs refers to the 1993 survey and no new information is coming on stream.  Information is power; things change because it is continually highlighted that there is a long wait for assessment, and identified <Col N="294" /> and documented special needs are not being met. That sort of information is the driving force of change and in the case of special educational needs the legislation should provide that parents have a right to this assessment to have their specific needs spelt out, and that there is an obligation on the Minister to maintain in the Department a database on special needs.  If he wants to plan provision for special educational needs he must have that information &mdash; to plan on the basis of a five year old survey is like driving a car while looking through the back window and the consequences will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>There is consensus in the Oireachtas that this area needs attention.  The Minister shares that belief and has indicated he hopes to move in this direction &mdash; he thinks we should adopt personalised education plans.  The Joint Committee on Education and Science recently held hearings on special education at which practitioners in the field demanded that we should move to such plans, in which the facts are stated and there is a commitment to honour stated needs.  It is interesting that in the UK, special education provision was introduced by a Government which one might have thought would not pay attention to such matters.  The UK legislation goes far beyond what I seek in my amendment; it is extremely strongly worded and underpins the rights of children with special educational needs.</P>
    <P>This is an important issue and I do not move this amendment frivolously.  I stripped away features of the previous amendment with which the Minister found fault, perhaps rightly.  I boiled the amendment down to one issue which I hope does not divide the House because going by what the Minister says he is committed to moving in this direction.  It is important because we are not collecting this information systematically so we cannot get information from the Department about the number of children with special educational needs and the services they receive.</P>
    <P>It was a shock to find that in 1993 half the children with special educational needs were receiving no services other than an ordinary teacher &mdash; no remedial or resource teacher service, nor any special service for visually impaired children.  This happened because the parents of those children had enough trouble simply keeping them on the rails and sending them to school every day, and they did not have the clout to bring their cases to public attention in the way that well-organised groups can.  There is, therefore, an obligation on us as legislators to include something explicit in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister may respond that he has accepted an obligation to provide appropriate education and support services, including assessments, but a broad obligation on the Minister to provide assessments under the legislation is different from parents having an explicit right to have these assessments when they are referred for them.  The other route will be extremely tendentious and difficult for parents to exercise, and has been made even more difficult by the Minister's recent <Col N="295" /> refusal to grant an appeal mechanism to parents who felt they did not get the education or the assessment to which their child was entitled.  The Minister said he may introduce the mechanism but it will only be through his good will and not on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Judging by Deputy O'Shea's earlier contributions, he will agree that this legislation should include a stronger statement on children with special needs.  I have repeatedly commended the Minister for changing his initial position, which was that the obligation to provide for children with special needs should rest solely on the school &mdash; he now recognises that responsibility cannot be shunted down the line.  An amendment like this would be a significant benchmark.  Over time it will provide a basis not only for parents to exercise their rights more freely but also for proper planning within the Department.  In other words, children diagnosed as having special educational needs by public health nurses at the developmental stage, aged one year or younger, would be logged and identified, and the Minister would know, three years before they reach the primary education system, what educational services they would be likely to need and could prioritise pre-school services towards children at these developmental stages.</P>
    <P>This would start a positive planning process within the Department.  Legislation is the vehicle for changes of direction and we all recognise the need for change here.  It does not cure things overnight but it sets us on a different route.  I hope this amendment commends itself to the Minister because it would set us on a better road as regards special education need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bruton's amendment. Two amendments in my name and one in the Minister's name are being discussed also, and all four have the common theme of planning for special educational needs.  I have been told by a Dublin teacher that many children in special classes in mainstream primary education fall out of the education system because there is no comparable provision in second level schools in their areas.  The concept in Deputy Bruton's amendment of setting up a database and information about children being input from an early stage is fundamental and welcome.  The whole process of tracking is vital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment alludes to special education needs.  We had a debate about what that term encompasses.  I am debating on the basis of the definition of the review group on special education which is that, as well as children who have an intellectual disability, a disability and gifted children, children whose lack of progress in the education system is due to social and environmental factors should also be included.  A database is vital in the context of these children. There is no doubt, and nobody has sought to contradict it, that some of these children fall out of the system in advance of their fifteenth birthday <Col N="296" /> and, while there is an obligation on children to attend school until they reach the age of 15, there is not the same emphasis on the responsibility of schools to take these children, particularly at second level.  Children are being abandoned against a background of there being no obligation on schools to inform the Department whether they have stopped going to school because of expulsion or by choice.  There is a school attendance service in some urban areas and the Garda Síochána look after rural areas, but the concept of tracking is fundamental to an effective and efficient education system.  It is mind boggling to think that many children who have special needs, whose chance to attain their full potential, to have a reasonable quality of life and to operate as good and upright citizens is at risk, are not known to the Department of Education and Science. In many cases the information is within the system but there is no way of pulling it together.</P>
    <P>There is some difficulty with the definition of special needs.  The Minister's definition is that it includes disability and giftedness, but nothing in between.  In his amendment No. 77, the Minister is going part of the way in this respect, but it is beyond belief that a particular education need can be identified and there is no statutory onus on the Department to produce a plan to address it.</P>
    <P>The current situation is random.  Special needs children are falling through the net.  They include the children to whom I referred earlier who have to be diagnosed in the private sector because the public sector does not provide the proper level of assessment to identify them.  This is not something that can be put off indefinitely, and fundamental to it are issues of information, the setting up of a comprehensive database and tracking children at risk.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be unduly critical.  I acknowledge the measures introduced by the Minister in various areas related to this, but the issues of inclusiveness and empowerment are fundamental. I do not intend to go over again the points made by Deputy Bruton in that regard.  However, as Dáil Deputies, as teachers or just as citizens we know there are people with special needs children who feel abandoned, who feel the system is alien to them and, as close spectators in a situation where there is not adequate provision for their special needs children, they are quite distraught. The most heartrending situation is when years go by before a problem is identified.  I am not making these comments to get at the Minister or the Department.  I am merely saying there is a need for change.  The ball rests with us in this Chamber because it is the job of the Oireachtas to introduce legislation.  If the difficulties people encounter are legislated for, other agencies outside this House can implement what is required by the legislation.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of individual plans.  Early diagnosis and early intervention is vital.  The growth of the schools psychological service is more than welcome, but comprehensive screening <Col N="297" /> of children at all stages of their development is also essential so that difficulties are picked up. It is appalling that children with special needs are identified so late that they have lived a good deal of their lives with no proper provision for the difficulties they were encountering.  There is much sadness and much anguish because of that.  We need to send clear signals that this Oireachtas wants to promote inclusiveness and empowerment, and inclusiveness and empowerment are part of the implementation of subsidiarity.  Parents have a right to know the problems and to be provided with support services and advice so they can cope at their end.  Special needs do not arise only in the context of education and school, but also in the context of the home and the environment. There is a need for inclusiveness and for what I would term a warm support for parents.</P>
    <P>I will give one example.  My fourth daughter has Down's syndrome.  When she was born there was a network of support through the Down's Syndrome Association which was very important and very helpful in the context of our family and how we developed to provide the best possible care for our daughter.  Subsequently, I found that in the case of an autistic child one does not have the same sort of networking because there are not as many autistic children born.  Autistic children tend to be scattered widely, as a result of which their parents can be very isolated.  I know this does not concern education <i>per se</i>, but at the time the child attains school-going age there is a need for inclusiveness.  It should be clearly demonstrated to such parents that the State is in sympathy with the difficulties they encounter and wants to provide every possible support.</P>
    <P>I will not make silly statements about everything being achieved overnight.  However, in the context of this legislation, we need to send a clear message to parents of children with special needs &mdash; I am talking about the wider definition of that term &mdash; that the State cares about them.  In many cases the school is the focus from which that spirit of inclusiveness and invitation to empowerment can best come.</P>
    <P>The Minister's amendment No. 77 seems to meet what I propose in amendment No. 78, which deals with the functions of inspectors.  Therefore, I will not pursue amendment No. 78.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 66 relates to the functions of schools.  In tabling that amendment I am trying to emphasise that when an assessment and diagnosis is carried out and a plan is put in place, part of the functions of the various partners in education should be to monitor that plan and see that it is implemented.  In the context of the spirit of what Deputy Bruton has proposed, parents must be involved and kept informed at all stages.  Many problems arise because information is not given. An attitude of mind can sometimes prevail whereby people feel they cannot cope or understand what they are being told.  They may not understand it but there is an onus on the State to make sure they will do so, over time.</P>
    <P>I have seen cases where there is a diagnosis of <Col N="298" /> intellectual disability and one or other of the partners may be in denial.  Thus, one partner has to cope with the problem over a period as well as coping with the other partner's denial.  Many human factors are involved in coming to terms with having a special needs child.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said earlier in the debate, the spirit of this House is in line with what I am saying.  My problem is that it is not sufficiently reflected in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for their contributions.  I acknowledge the bona fides of their commitment to the issue of special needs. This Bill is far superior to the Education (No. 1) Bill in providing for special needs children.  It is even superior to the original draft of the Education (No. 2) Bill.  We have made progress in provision for special needs, particularly in terms of the rights of special needs children to an education.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions I have outlined to the House my plan to establish a database for primary education in its entirety and specifically for children with special needs.  It is a source of regret, to say the least, that historically, to date, such a database has not been developed at primary level.  Information is the key to developing intervention strategies and proper policy actions. One cannot really formulate policy actions in a vacuum where one does not have the requisite information.</P>
      <P>The key issue in special needs at the moment is resources.  The CIRC report outlined the needs as the special education review committee saw them.  It is interesting that members of the committee now acknowledge that, for some reason, they did not officially identify autism as a category requiring special education intervention, so the needs of autistic children were not listed.  I aim to change that quickly to ensure the right of children with autism to an education.  We have much catching up to do in terms of the provision of resources for special needs children.</P>
      <P>To be frank, particularly with regard to Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 60, I am not sure the system is ready for the statutory provision in relation to statementing or individual plans.  We have to measure what we can achieve in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need a wider debate on statementing and plans.  In dealing with the special needs area, I have noticed that there can often be conflict between the assessment views of professionals and those of parents in respect of their children. It is not that simple when a professional produces an assessment and states that, in his or her opinion, the child should progress in accordance with this plan.  Very often parents will differ strongly with a professional's advice about what is best for their child.  We need to tease out a bit more this concept of statementing and individual planning.  To a certain degree, a significant amount of assessment is taking place too slowly. We need more personnel in the field, not just in <Col N="299" /> education but in the health boards also, to ensure that assessments are made more swiftly.  I have often seen conflict where our inspector's analysis differs from that of a parent's.  For example, parents will say their children should not have to attend a special school.  They may want their child to attend a mainstream school, but the professionals may disagree.</P>
    <P>While the concept is a good one, I am not sure that we have teased it out fully.  It would be interesting to look at what impact the measure has had in the United Kingdom and what the fall-out is there.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with special needs is that we have had too many court cases.  That so many parents have had recourse to the courts is both a reflection upon and an indictment of the State and successive Governments in terms of how they have handled special needs children.  I aim to deal with that matter and make sure that the courts become a place of last resort as opposed to one almost of first resort.  Over the years we have had too many High Court cases involving parents.  We had the O'Donoghue case and others.  Parents have sent their children abroad in the belief that they will receive an education superior to anything that could be provided here.  We would not necessarily agree with that.  It is a complicated issue.</P>
    <P>We are committed to the compilation of an information database and that matter is currently in hand.  There will be further improvement of the provision of special needs.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 77 comes some distance towards meeting Deputy O'Shea's amendment No. 78 in terms of inspectors assessing and evaluating individual school plans that have been drawn up to provide for certain special needs children.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the legislation is to set out the direction we want to go.  I appreciate the Minister's honesty in saying we are not yet at a point where we can develop education plans immediately.  I would be happy if the Minister inserted a clause that each year progress will be monitored, defects identified and the process for eliminating them put in place.  He could make it a rolling programme so that we cannot say the Department can do something tomorrow morning when the Minister said it was not able to do it today.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important to put a legislative sign post in place which shows the direction in which we are heading so that it is not decided on a whim each day in the Department.  I recognise the Minister's difficulty but I am not willing to forget this issue on that basis.  The Minister should make this a rolling vehicle rather than changing it every morning.</P>

We must make progress by implementing our aspirations on a phased basis. It is important to send the right signal to parents. They, like ourselves, do not believe everything can be delivered overnight.  We should introduce an annual review mechanism to deal with glaring discrepancies in terms of provision.</P>
      <P>If we do not take this opportunity to convey the concept of inclusiveness, empowerment and support, people will continue to feel alienated from the system.  We should commit ourselves to making people feel they are part of the system.  If the Minister accepts the amendment proposed by Deputy Richard Bruton, he will not expose himself but he will ensure there is a measure of good will in the legislation and a vehicle for incremental progress.</P>

      <P>I took care when drafting this amendment not to include a commitment that the education plan would be fully resourced.  I recognise there is a gap between identifying and filling needs.  This amendment is a vehicle for identifying needs.  It creates an expectation that over time these needs will be met but it does not make it obligatory to meet them.  Instead, it ensures that this information is systematically collected and maintained by the Department and that it becomes a vehicle for planning provision.</P>
      <P>The Minister is correct that parents and professionals disagree.  Under the Constitution parents have recognised rights.  We are not seeking to encroach on those but to give parents the information on which they can make informed choices.  That is built into paragraph (a) of the amendment.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he will consider an amendment along these lines with some modifications.  We hope he will achieve the objective of a built in review over time.  That would be a significant step forward.</P>

      <P>I want to delete section 9(d).  As stated on Committee Stage, it is extraordinary that all references to health have been removed from this section. However, amendment No. 68 in the name of the Minister reinserts the term &ldquo;health education&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are a number of points I wish to make. The term &ldquo;to promote the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students&rdquo; is nebulous whereas the phrase &ldquo;to provide social, personal and health education for students&rdquo; is more definitive and places an onus on schools &mdash; this section deals with their functions &mdash; to provide education.  The wording used in the Bill gives rise to a number of questions.  For example, are morals taught or are they inculcated?  I believe the wording proposed in the amendment is more accurate and realistic than the formulation proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister tabled amendment No. 68 following the Committee Stage debate.  However, the formulation proposed in amendment No. 67 where the onus is placed on schools &ldquo;to provide social, personal and health education for students and to promote their moral development in consultation with their parents&rdquo; is more apt.  The phrase &ldquo;in consultation with their parents&rdquo; is important.  I have tabled a number of later amendments which deal <Col N="302" /> with the ethos of schools and the fact that children attending a school with a particular religious ethos should not feel alienated in any way. However, that is a separate issue.</P>
    <P>My main point is that education can be provided in respect of social, personal and health matters but I do not believe it can be provided in respect of morals.  Education can be provided but it must be aligned to the moral standards which have been inculcated in the home, through religious practice or through religious education in schools.  It is a contradiction in terms, however, to state that we can teach morals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit that parts of the debate are over my head.  However, I do not agree with Deputy O'Shea on one issue because I believe morals can be taught.  Having tried to study moral philosophy for one year and attempted to contend with concepts such as Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, I believe one can learn about morals and that there are principles which one can learn to guide one in making choices that are moral according to one's beliefs.  I would not agree with Deputy O'Shea in that regard, but I do not believe that was his central point.</P>
      <P>The formulation put forward by the Minister in amendment No. 68 is probably reasonably balanced and I will support it.  With regard to the phrase &ldquo;to promote their moral development in consultation with their parents&rdquo; used in amendment No. 67, regard must be had to the characteristic spirit of a school.  For example, parents who knowingly send their children to a school of one denominational sort accept that a certain moral code will be taught there and they cannot state that the characteristic spirit of the school is not recognised.</P>
      <P>The balance in the Minister's formulation is correct because schools are concerned that it will become more difficult to maintain their characteristic as parents increasingly shy away from religious practice or adherence to codes of any sort.  Schools which offer education from a denominational perspective would like this recognition to be enshrined in legislation.  The balance the Minister is striking in this instance seems reasonable.</P>

There is a lacuna in section 9(d), namely, the absence of a reference to &ldquo;health education&rdquo;, a term which amendment No. 68 will insert.  I have no doubt the amendment was inspired by this matter being raised by Deputy O'Shea and others on Committee Stage.  The lacuna in the paragraph will be corrected.

The word &ldquo;to&rdquo; should be deleted and the text should read &ldquo;it shall, as far as resources permit.promote equality of opportunity for both male and female students and staff of the school&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;to&rdquo; is not only superfluous but it is also inappropriate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 12, after &ldquo;policy&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which does not involve entrance examinations and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the functions of schools and to section 9, paragraph (m).  Entrance examinations can be the cause of friction and concern to many people.  There should be equality in the process of enrolment to a school.  Schools should not be allowed to cream off the best applicants.  There is another argument which can be advanced which relates to assessing children in terms of their abilities when they come to a school but these should be used only in the context of the educational plans which would be put in place for those children when they enter the school.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party and I are totally opposed to the idea of examinations being used to exclude children from schools.  That is a reprehensible practice.  In the past some schools have had the benefit of essentially recruiting from a group in society which was well tuned in to the potential of the education system.  Nowadays schools are being called upon to cater for pupils of an ability level and social functional level which they were not asked to cater for in the past.</P>
      <P>Each school subsidised by the Exchequer should accept all students.  The Minister has included in the Bill, in the context of the appeals procedure to the Secretary General, that there would be a right to appeal by parents, or the student if he or she is over 18, if the reason a person was not admitted to a school was other than accommodation.  What I propose is in line with the spirit of what the Minister has included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>It could arise at the time of transition from first to second level that a student would benefit from special education and that should be provided but schools subsidised by the State should receive all the pupils presented to them without any process of exclusion.  It is fundamental to what I was talking about earlier.  If on the basis of an academic examination there is no place for the child of a dysfunctional family or for a child with special educational needs, that can have an appalling effect not only on the student but on the parents. If we are to achieve subsidiarity, inclusiveness and empowerment, the use of any academic tool to exclude children from a school is something against which we should all set our faces.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Shea on this issue.</P>
      <P>It is frustrating to learn that while we are here debating the education Bill and issues such as school attendance the Minister is at a press conference announcing details of changes he is proposing to make in relation to issues we debated here earlier.  It shows scant enough courtesy to the House.  The Minister should be in the House debating issues.  It is unusual and it makes a non-sense of what we are trying to do on Report Stage to find that the Minister absents himself to make announcements which are germane to what we are doing here.  It does not set a good precedent. Maybe the reports I am hearing of what has been announced are inaccurate and the Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  The issues I am addressing here are central to this Bill.  Far from being here to deal with them, the Minister is at some press conference making announcements outside of the House in relation to issues which are properly within the remit of what we are discussing here.  Deputy O'Shea tabled amendments which relate to school attendance and I gather the Minister is making announcements which were not conveyed to the House during the course of that debate.  It should not go without being noted by the Houses of the Oireachtas that this is not what we would regard as acceptable practice.</P>

      <P>After my initial good relationship with Deputy O'Shea, unfortunately I must part company with him at this point.  However, I have a certain sympathy for some of the sentiments he expressed having had first hand experience of admissions difficulties which occur in Limerick schools from time to time.  Nevertheless it must be said that for the first time in the history of the State schools are now legislatively obliged to publish and maintain an admissions policy.  It is not just that they must publish the admissions policy but that the policy must provide for &ldquo;maximum accessibility to the school&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendment in connection with entrance examinations.  This amendment is not necessary as the details of admissions policies are not matters which should be appropriate to <Col N="306" /> the legislation.  We set out the broad principle. We should not get into the details of what schools should or should not include in their admissions policy.  The statutory obligation on each school to publish its admissions policy which must respect the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to schools of their choice should be sufficient to ensure that such policies are reasonable and safeguard the rights of each child to attend the school of his or her choice. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's legislative programme published by the Chief Whip on 28 September 1998 lists 18 Bills which the Government expects to publish before the end of the year.  No Government Bills to amend the Constitution are envisaged in that period, but we have agreed in principle to bring forward at a future date a proposal to accord a constitutional guarantee for local government as recommended by the All Party Committee on the Constitution.  This proposal is being developed by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in the context of amending legislation on local government reform.  It is envisaged that the text of the proposed constitutional amendment will be referred to the all party committee for consideration.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate when he expects the legislation for reform of local government, which will include a proposal to amend the Constitution to give constitutional clarity for local government, to come before the Dáil and when does he expect it to come before the constitutional review committee?  Given the consideration the Government has given to regionalisation in the context of new EU Structural Funding and the demands of the EU Commission in that regard, does the Taoiseach consider an amendment of the Constitution will be required to devolve Oireachtas powers to regional authorities?</P>

We know from statements by the EU commissioner that if the Government proceeds on that basis the EU Commission will require the ensuing regional authorities to have devolved powers.  Does the Taoiseach believe such a devolution of powers would require a constitutional change?  From my reading of the Constitution such a change would be required, given that ultimate authority lies with the Oireachtas and in order to satisfy the EU Commission that the authorities will not be constructed merely for the purposes of subsidy shopping, as the EU commissioner referred to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied the approach being taken by my Department to deal with the year 2000 issues is effective and that satisfactory progress is being made.  A number of systems have already been upgraded or replaced and work is ongoing with a view to ensuring compliancy of all critical systems by the end of this year.  Of the £20,000 estimated for direct year 2000 costs, a total of £8,400 has been spent to date by my Department.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that a reply has been sent to the person referred to by Deputy Bruton.  Responsibility for dealing with the year 2000 problem rests with the Minister for Finance for the measures being taken within the public service and with the Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and commerce for measures to assist in raising awareness and guidelines on tackling the issue in the wider business community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 5, is the Taoiseach satisfied his Department is on course for full year 2000 compliance?  Will he indicate how his Department officials are testing the systems? Have they got certificates of compliance or certificates verifying that the systems will work? If the systems go wrong will the consultants who have prepared the necessary changes in the software be liable for payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's IT personnel and consultants checked each stage of the implementation of the plan.  All the critical equipment, the new servers, the server upgrades and databases have been checked.  The building management system has been tested independently. Work has been completed on the two security systems.  Work on the telephone system, the personnel administration system, the network management software and server upgrades has been implemented and checked.  The Department is carrying out some work in regard to NESC and NESF which are connected to it, but that work is being done independently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's question on insurance, that is not a major issue in my Department, but <Col N="312" /> it is a major issue in the broader sense.  The Attorney General is examining this matter to ascertain the position regarding liability.  The question as to what might happen is a much broader issue which has been debated not only here but in other countries.  Some countries have tried to legislate on this issue, but have failed. The Attorney General is examining how it would affect the broader public service, but I do not believe it will pose a problem in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, have overall responsibility for ensuring all Departments are compliant and equipped to deal with the year 2000 problem.  Have they ensured the suppliers of the software are fully bonded in the same way a building contractor would be bonded for a construction project undertaken by the State?  In the event of the design system they have supplied failing and the cost being borne by the citizens of this State, have they ensured there will be some compensation?  What bonding, compensation or safeguards have the Government sought in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not dealing directly with those issues.  The interdepartmental monitoring committee, which is under the remit of the Department of Finance, is dealing directly with them.  The question of liability has arisen on a number of occasions in different areas and the Attorney General has been involved in examining how we can attach liability.  This affects the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and a good deal of work has been undertaken on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This question may relate to more than the Taoiseach's Department, but will he agree the provision of resources next year to deal with the year 2000 problem could coincide with a period of acute credit shortage in the world arising from the current difficulties in Asia and Latin America which may have a significant economic knock on effect that would adversely affect employment?  Regarding Deputy Quinn's question, will the Taoiseach agree there is a genuine risk of a cascade of legal actions arising from this which could have unknowable effects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why this issue is being examined.  I have heard colleagues discuss this matter and, like other Members, I have read articles on it.  The question of liability has arisen in regard to the new airport in Hong Kong. Because of technology problems the authorities have not been able to operate the systems there and that has given rise to many legal actions. The Office of the Attorney General is examining the question of the State's liability in the event of incidents stemming from the year 2000 problem to ensure liability attaches to those who provided services in the area of hardware and software. <Col N="313" /> Regarding Deputy Bruton's question on cost, a significant cost is involved for Departments and agencies, particularly for the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners, which have spent a good deal of money, but most of the work has been completed.  While it is not under my aegis, the Government is getting a full report at regular intervals so I am aware of what is happening in all areas.  We are anxious to complete as much of the work as is possible.  There is worldwide concern about how it will affect economic issues next year.  From recent conferences and seminars I have attended with the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, I understand that the wider public service, business services, larger companies, multinationals, financial institutions and many smaller companies have made the necessary expenditure.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about smaller companies and I would be misleading the House if I said differently.  That is why I attended some conferences with the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. He will go around the country with the roadshow, pointing out the dangers of leaving this matter too late.  There is a great need to convince small business people that this issue is relevant to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Government's experience of the hepatitis C scandal where the State was found to be negligent and the army deafness claims where the State was found to be negligent through army personnel, can we take steps now to ensure the necessary legal provisions are put in place so any claims for negligence, arising from the consequence of an incomplete preparation for the year 2000 resulting in hardship for individuals, will fall?  Can we anticipate this disaster in advance and take the necessary legal steps, if not to eliminate, to minimise the damage?  Can we learn from our collective mistakes in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are very important questions. I hope the answer is yes, but I cannot say that at this stage.  That is why the Office of the Attorney General is looking at the matter.  It is creating a major problem elsewhere as people have tried to legislate for it but cannot.  Perhaps when the Attorney General reports to the committee on the matter, the Minister for Finance will make that information available.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought is contained in the schedule which is being circulated.  Since the Act commenced on 21 April 1998, my Department has received 50 requests.  Twenty have been granted and of these ten have been partially granted.  Seven requests are ongoing and four requests were transferred to other Departments. Where requests have been partially granted, certain information was withheld as it was exempt under various relevant sections of the Act.  In addition, 17 requests have been refused and two have been withdrawn.</P>
      <P>All but one of the requests fully processed to date have been dealt with within the time frames allowed under the Act.  The specific length of time taken to process each request within these time limits varies, depending on the complexity of the request and the volume of records requested.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the grounds for refusing the 17 cases?  Why were the two cases withdrawn, was it at the request of the Department or was it voluntarily done by those who sought the information?  Will he indicate what provision is in the Freedom of Information Act for a member of the public or a Member of this House to seek the verbal advice which the Taoiseach or other Ministers receive from heads of Departments or the Attorney General?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard enough to get written advice.  Deputy De Rossa is familiar with the Act.  Of the 17 cases refused, eight were refused because no relevant records were held in the Department; three were refused because they were too broad in scope and the requester did not respond to the offer to reconsider more focused questions, which is what happens when there is an omnibus question; and six were refused because they were exempt under various sections of the Act.  I do not know why two requests were withdrawn.  I assume it was at the behest of whoever was involved.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, an official is designated in each Department to deal with its functions and they independently examine requests.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of costs, other than the designated official who spends a great deal of time dealing with requests, it is part of others' normal duties.  They do not have extra functions or receive extra allowances.  The charges levied to individuals under the legislation to date amount to £345 and a deposit of £69 has been sought from others.  There is no charge for photocopying as a letter or two is all that is normally requested.</P>

      <P>In pursuit of the question of verbal advice, in response to the first question the Taoiseach indicated that he received verbal advice, presumably from the Attorney General, as regards important legislation.  That, to say the least, is highly unusual.  It is my understanding that when the Attorney General gives advice about legislation, he does so in writing.  Is there any way in which, under the Freedom of Information Act, the advice which the Taoiseach claimed he received verbally as regards regional and local government can be made available to Deputies in this House?  It could be lodged in the Library.  I presume that at the very least he would have made a note of the advice he received.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a brief courtesy visit with a delegation of senior Libyan officials on Friday, 24 July.  The delegation had been invited by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to visit Ireland and explained that it had taken up the invitation with a view to improving Libya's relations with Ireland and with the European Union, in both political and trade terms.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to press the delegation to restore the trade link in live cattle which had been beneficial to both our countries in the past. I was pleased to be informed by the delegation that the existing barriers to the live cattle and beef trade between the two countries would be removed following its return to Libya.  I am pleased to note that this has now happened.  I hope that contracts will be concluded very shortly.</P>
      <P>I understand that our Ambassador in Rome who is accredited to Libya is currently in Tripoli with the express intention of making this happen. He will meet senior officials from the Foreign Ministry, relevant officials in the Libyan veterinary service and the Ministry of Animal Wealth and the head of the State Importing Agency, Luhum.</P>
      <P>On a more general note, the Libyan delegation expressed the hope that progress on the Lockerbie case could lead to a breakthrough for Libya's international trading.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware there is serious disappointment in farming circles about the failure in practice to re-open the Libyan market? While it is open in theory, no Irish cattle have been bought and Irish suppliers are being outpriced by Australian suppliers?  This is causing a serious income problem for farmers.</P>

      <P>It is surprising and upsetting that the matter has not been resolved.  The clear signal from the Libyan authorities was that the market would reopen in the third quarter but that has not happened.  There has been daily contact for the past ten days or so.  Our ambassador, Mr. Small, has been in Libya since Friday or Saturday.  I understand it is an internal Government matter.  Mr. El-Atrash understood that everything was in order but difficulties arose between him and the Minister for Animal Wealth which have not been resolved.  I understand from the Minister for Agriculture and Food that our ambassador is staying on in Libya to try to resolve the matter.</P>

      <P>I have received two letters from President Santer in the last three months.  The first was in response to a letter I sent him on 14 July to express the Government's concern about the suspension of budget lines, specifically those relating to poverty and social exclusion.  President Santer replied on 7 September outlining the reasons for the Commission's action and indicating that &ldquo;implementation of these headings may be resumed as preparatory measures&rdquo; in the context of ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  I am particularly pleased about the progress on this issue which came about due to Ireland's initiative at the Budget Council on 17 July for which we received written thanks from the NGOs originally affected by the suspension of funding.</P>
      <P>I received a second letter from President Santer on 17 August when he wrote to express his sympathy and that of the European Commission for the outrage in Omagh.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic management initiative, SMI, is a wide-ranging programme for the modernisation of the Civil and public Service.  Responsibility for implementation ultimately rests with the head of each public service body to deepen the process <Col N="319" /> and embed the strategic management approach within their individual organisations.</P>
    <P>Because of its role at the centre of government, my Department has played a leading part in the design and implementation of the process to date. In view of the range and complexity of the measures involved, the process is being overseen by a co-ordinating group, an implementation group for the Civil Service and various working groups to develop the proposals contained in Delivering Better Government.  Membership of these groups is not just confined to officials but includes experts from diverse private sector backgrounds. The groups are supported by a cross-departmental SMI team of officials drawn from a variety of Departments and offices based in my Department.  The team also facilitates the implementation throughout the Civil Service of the recommendations that emerge from the groups' deliberations.  The process is further supported by networks of officials across the Civil Service involved in, for example, quality service, personnel and information technology.</P>
    <P>To date a number of significant initiatives have been taken, legislative and administrative.  Crucial underpinning legislation, such as the Public Service Management Act, 1997, and the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, is now in place.  As Deputies will be aware, the first strategy statements of Departments and offices under the Public Service Management Act were laid before the House by 1 May, as I had promised.  Strategic planning through preparation of these statements is central to the SMI process.  Changes have been introduced in the multi-annual budgeting and administrative budget aspects of financial management. The introduction of performance management and other human resource changes is under discussion with the Civil Service unions. Later this year I expect to have further recommendations on regulatory reform, financial management and information technology before Government for consideration to build on progress to date.</P>
    <P>Steps have been taken to roll out the SMI to the wider public service.  My Department is working closely with Departments which have bodies under their aegis as we begin to facilitate the extension of the SMI.  A group is in place under the chairmanship of my Department consisting of representatives of Departments with responsibility for the organisations in the wider public service, the Local Government Management Services Board and the Health Service Employers Agency to progress the modernisation programme.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service and the wider public service the programme of change will be advanced through the partnership arrangements agreed under Partnership 2000.  This work is being supported by the National Centre for Partnership.  A significant amount of work has been done throughout the Civil and public Service to provide the excellent service we require.  It is essential <Col N="320" /> that each Department and office now takes responsibility for progressing the next steps in the SMI.  My Department will continue to support them as it has since 1994.</P>

      <P>Performance management in my Department and elsewhere consists of an effort to provide a transparent account of people doing more work in a more efficient way and taking responsibility for duties with which they are directly dealing as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  This means that officials take on more responsibilities and duties than they would have done in the past.  It is my intention that this is how the initiative will work in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On 17 December 1997 I informed the House that in accordance with a Government decision taken in October 1996 the future of social partnership structures has been reviewed in consultation with the social partners in the context of Partnership 2000.  The review had taken account of the views of both the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Economic and Social Council which are representative of all strands of social partnership. Based on the outcome of that review and in response to the views put forward by NESC and NESF and in particular the NESF report No. 16, <Col N="322" /> A Framework for Partnership, I informed the House on 4 February that the Government had announced on 19 December its decision to reconstitute both organisations on a statutory basis.  In the interim both NESC and NESF were reconstituted on a non-statutory basis and I understand their inaugural meetings are due to take place in the near future.  With regard to legislation, the Government recently approved the drafting of a Bill to place both on a statutory footing.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of both bodies have been revised to ensure that their activities are fully complementary.  NESC will continue to provide strategic analysis to its reports and will develop a framework within which discussions on future national programmes will take place. NESF will focus on the detailed monitoring of initiatives taken in the context of social partnership especially with regard to social exclusion and long-term unemployment.  The membership of both bodies is being changed to reflect more fully the various strands of the social partnership process.</P>
      <P>The composition of the new bodies is as follows: the NESC comprises five nominees from each of the four social partner pillars, five representatives from Government Departments, one of whom will be a county manager representing local government interests and five independent members, one of whom will represent local government interests.  The NESF will comprise 15 Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, five nominees from each of the business, trade union and farming pillars, 15 representatives of non-Governmental organisations, five representatives of Government Departments, five local government representatives and five independent members.</P>
      <P>The main changes in composition relate to the inclusion of local government representation and community and voluntary representation on the NESC and the inclusion of Government Departments and local government representatives on the NESF.  The terms of office of members of the NESC and NESF will be for a period of three years during which time members may nominate alternates.</P>
      <P>As regards administrative arrangements, the Office of Public Works is seeking a premises where both the NESC and NESF can be accommodated. This will be a requisite for facilitating better co-operation and sharing support services between both bodies which is being investigated by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the NESF and NESC have worked quite well up to now without being put on a statutory footing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assured Deputy Bruton a long time ago that I would examine that issue.  I did so and spoke with both organisations and with officials dealing with them.  The primary reason for putting the organisations on a statutory footing is that it had been indicated that the non-statutory <Col N="323" /> basis of the organisations presented difficulties for the staff and for the structures.  There was much discussion of this problem before my involvement and it had continued over a period. It was recommended that as long as they were on a non-statutory basis their existence was temporary and this created staffing difficulties.  There were other reasons for placing the bodies on a statutory basis but that was the main one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>This rigidity in social partnership is being driven by the demands of staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being driven by a concern for the security of the entire system.  If there is to be a proper structure and the required support, our advice is that the organisations must be placed on a statutory basis.  Otherwise there would be an insecurity for those involved and for their structures and terms of reference.  This was set down some time ago and it was on that basis that the outgoing NESF and NESC wished to place the bodies on a legislative basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that social partnership is a living thing which changes and that the partners which are relevant at a particular time may not be relevant five years later? Would the Taoiseach agree that it is most unwise to put these bodies on a statutory footing if that means that changing the representation of social partners will require legislation each time it is done?  Is the Taoiseach aware that the Government has promised approximately 100 Bills? Does he not agree that every time the representation on the NESF and NESC is changed primary legislation will be required?  This will build a deep and unnecessary rigidity into the system. Does the Taoiseach further agree that any problems concerning staff should be dealt with separately as a staff matter by some enabling legislation governing staff?  It should not be necessary to create an institutional, statutorily based dinosaur which cannot be changed readily.  That is contrary to the whole idea of social partnership. The Taoiseach should look at the economic and social council in France to see an example of a good idea gone wrong because it was put on a rigid statutory footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Bruton raised this matter I did not disagree with him.  In the interests of stability the people who worked in both these organisations sought to clarify the position but neither their staff associations nor unions could do that for them.  They had sought legal advice and were told this was the only way of resolving the issue.  That is what the people associated with these organisations requested and we went along with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other issue, the legislation should be framed in such a way as to allow maximum flexibility. I agree with Deputy Bruton that as we move on the concept of social partnership will <Col N="324" /> develop and different organisations may be added or removed, but this House should not have to amend primary legislation every time that happens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the article published last week which alleged that the Revenue Commissioners turned a blind eye to tax fraud in relation to DIRT and bogus non-resident accounts.  This issue is not new.  In April of this year I gave a detailed reply to a question on this matter from Deputy Rabbitte.  On Thursday last the House discussed the position at length by way of special statements and questions and answers. Yesterday, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>The pursuit of particular tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and they deal with taxpayers on a confidential basis.  Having regard to the material already available to the media and the public controversy arising from it, the chairman, exceptionally, made it clear to the Committee of Public Accounts that there was no settlement or write-off of tax in the particular case raised by the Deputy and went into some detail on the background to this issue.  The chairman also referred to the discussions initiated in the past with the main financial institutions to ensure the non-resident account situation was regularised by review by the institutions of the relevant non-resident declarations.  The Committee of Public Accounts was informed that in those discussions Revenue was not in a position to enter into general settlements, nor did they.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even prior to the earlier media reports this year of historical non-compliance in this area, the Revenue Commissioners had already commenced a review of the position generally.  Their review includes an examination of ongoing controls, procedures and liabilities and, where considered necessary, involves an examination of liabilities in past years.  The review covers all financial institutions and is well advanced.  As the Revenue Commissioners have made clear, since there was no question of having made a specific monetary <Col N="325" /> settlement, they are required to pursue the relevant DIRT liability.</P>
    <P>With regard to the further steps required to ensure there is no reoccurrence of these events, both Revenue and my Department are actively reviewing the existing powers which Revenue has in relation to tax evasion.  This review involves examining extra powers in relation to access to bank accounts and the examination of the affairs of banking institutions.  Revenue powers were last added to significantly in 1992, with further additions in 1993 and 1995.  The outcome of this latest review will be examined in the light of the report of the Moriarty tribunal so that whatever measures are considered necessary in this area can be taken.  The Government will be supportive of measures which can assure that the liability of persons for tax can be reasonably and effectively pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Has the Minister inquired from Revenue how it can maintain the position that a settlement was not made with AIB when it is a matter of public record that a meeting took place between Revenue and AIB to discuss this matter?  In a letter of 13 February 1991, a senior tax official wrote to AIB stating that a settlement would be negotiated on any DIRT outstanding prior to 30 June 1991, without publication or penalty, but that the full rigours of the law would be applied in relation to any liability arising after that date.  It is a matter of record, written by the senior inspector dealing with the issue, that a settlement was offered to AIB, that AIB negotiated a settlement and that the settlement was made.  How can the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners make a statement contrary to the correspondence issuing from Revenue?</P>

      <P>I have noted the correspondence to which the Deputy refers which is reported in today's newspapers and previously, but I have not asked the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners about this specific case, nor do I intend to.  My discussions with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners in these matters respect the delineation of powers between the Minister for Finance and the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand the Chairman was examined extensively at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday; his replies are on the public record.  I understand also that the people from the relevant institution will appear before the Committee of Public Accounts later this week and they will be further examined. It would not be appropriate nor has it ever been the practice that Ministers for Finance discuss individual cases with the Revenue Commissioners, and I intend to continue that long established practice.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that in this matter of great public concern, where there is outrage among taxpayers, the Minister is washing his <Col N="326" /> hands of the issue, that he is saying it is a matter entirely for the Revenue Commissioners and that he does not have a policy position on it?  Will the Minister ask the Revenue Commissioners if they intend to collect all outstanding taxes or does the settlement which was made in the early months of 1991 hold as a full and final settlement?  The Minister has to have a policy position on this matter. That is the responsibility of Ministers for Finance. The Minister must have a policy position if £100 million in tax was not paid.  It is not good enough for him to say he will not discuss the matter with the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and that whatever they do is fine with him.</P>

      <P>In my budget speech last December I stated that the Government is open to considering such a move provided that all the complex issues can be fully teased out and the system can be introduced into the tax code in a manageable way.  The position has not changed in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained last December that the issues of standard rating and tax credits are the subject of an examination by a special working group set up under Partnership 2000, which is chaired by my <Col N="327" /> Department.  This group produced its report last January and is currently engaged in a further examination of the policy and practical issues associated with the introduction of a tax credits system.</P>

Does the Minister agree with a quotation in <i>The Irish Times</i>, apparently attributable to a spokeswoman for his Department who I assume to be the press officer, which confirmed that the Department did not see any difficulties in implementing the changes, or is this to be regarded simply as a kite in advance of the budget?</P>

      <P>There are not insurmountable difficulties in introducing a tax credits system but the debate on whether such a system would be the most appropriate way to proceed has gone on for some time.  There are differing views about this matter.  It has been examined by the tax strategy group and, as I indicated in my budget speech last year, I will give the matter further consideration. The matter will be considered between now and budget day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention that it is not possible to introduce this system overnight.  There has been considerable debate about the tax credits system, as the Deputy is well aware, and there are merits and demerits in the particular suggestion.  Last week I read articles by at least three experts who took opposing views on this matter, including a professor of the Economic and Social Research Institute who commented that what is envisaged in a tax credit system could easily be achieved by making some adjustments to the current system. It is a matter for more debate and the Government will make up its mind before the budget in December.</P>

      <P>Whatever about other issues, it has been my experience of this Minister that he does have a view on tax issues.  While he has neatly disguised the debate which we all know is going on, he has not given the slightest indication of his own view.  Does he disagree with the spokeswoman for his Department who seemed to indicate three weeks ago that there is no difficulty in doing that?  Perhaps he would indicate if he accepts the advice he was given that it would take two years to introduce such a system.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that agreement has been reached with the EU Commission on the timetable for phasing out the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and certain internationally traded services, including those provided from the IFSC and Shannon.  The agreement, which was announced by the Government on 22 July 1998, will mean that the single 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax for trading activities will generally apply from 2003.  However, existing projects which were entitled to the 10 per cent rate at 22 July 1998, plus certain IDA and IFSC pipeline projects approved by 31 July 1998, will retain entitlement to the 10 per cent rate until the end of 2005 in the case of the IFSC and Shannon or until the end of 2010 in the case of manufacturing and certain internationally traded services.</P>
      <P>The agreement also provides that new projects established after 22 July 1998 in manufacturing and certain internationally traded services, including new projects in the IFSC and Shannon, will be eligible for 10 per cent until the end of 2002 after which they will be subject to the 12.5 per cent rate.  However, the deadline for approving new projects at the IFSC and Shannon has been brought forward by one year to the end of 1999, which will mean that new IFSC and Shannon projects establishing after this date will be subject to the standard rate then applying.  The agreement also regulates the number of new IDA and IFSC projects availing of the 10 per cent rate until 2003.  In the period 1998 to 2002 inclusive, the number of new IDA approved greenfield projects and new IDA approved projects of established firms will be restricted to 77 per year, while the number of new IFSC projects in 1998 and 1999 will be restricted to 67 per year.</P>
      <P>The question of reducing corporation tax rates between now and 2003 to facilitate the introduction of a 12.5 per cent rate for trading income by that year, and the related question of the timing of the 25 per cent rate for non-trading income, will be considered by the Government in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The two matters to which the Deputy refers are totally unrelated.  The negotiations regarding the 10 per cent tax rate have been going on for some time.  The matter is now concluded.  Separately there has been a tentative directive before the Commission for a long time regarding a rate of tax for interest on savings. That debate has moved forward in a different forum &mdash; the ECOFIN council.  There is no connection between the two issues.</P>
      <P>The debate with Commissioner Van Miert in his directive regarding the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax conducted since I became Minister for Finance related to the 10 per cent manufacturing tax rate and IFSC and Shannon related projects with no spill over into the other area.  The debate on the proposed directive has been proceeding at ECOFIN for some time and various views have been expressed.  I could not give a definite date for the likely conclusion of that debate but I assure the Deputy that there is no interaction between the two ideas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm absolutely that in the context of the negotiations regarding the new corporate manufacturing tax rate there is no connection between it and the other separate debate regarding a general tax on interest.  There was no connection nor was any sought.  It was not mentioned at any level in these negotiations.  These negotiations have proved difficult and many matters arose in the debate but that was not one of them.</P>

      <P>By way of written reply one of the Minister's colleagues informed me that the question of tax designation for urban areas has been deferred pending agreement by the EU Commission to certain proposals.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another set of negotiations which have been going on for some time which are proving equally difficult.  Ireland's measures regarding incentive taxation such as designation, special corporation tax rates for manufacturing, the IFSC and Shannon and everything related to taxation have come under focus in Europe because of the country's success in recent years.  The matters to which the Deputy <Col N="331" /> refers are all in separate boxes but no matter where one goes in Europe I am afraid the taxation question comes up quite regularly.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, brought forward on the rescheduling of Third World debt at the IMF meeting in Washington; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[19703/98]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no new proposal for Third World debt rescheduling brought forward at the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington.  Rather the emphasis was on implementing and improving the mechanisms which have been put in place in recent years.</P>
      <P>The principal instrument operated by the World Bank and IMF for alleviating the burden of Third World debt is the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.  The aim of the initiative is to ensure that the heavily indebted poor countries demonstrate a track record of sustained strong policy performance, are able to strengthen their poverty reduction programmes and permanently exit from future debt reschedulings.</P>
      <P>This initiative was endorsed by the bank and the fund in September 1996.  The initiative was designed to reduce the burden of debt for these countries to sustainable levels.  Those institutions to whom the debt was owed would be called on to make proportionate contributions to reducing the burden of servicing the debt.  The initiative called for participation by sovereign bilateral creditors as well as the multilateral creditor institutions. While it was open to bilateral creditors to contribute through debt forgiveness or rescheduling, the multilateral institutions would contribute mainly through financing debt service either from their own resources or through the contributions of their members, rather than through rescheduling.</P>
      <P>Nine countries have so far reached a decision point on debt rescheduling.  Of these, two were judged not to need assistance, and the remaining seven require assistance totalling about $6.1 billion in nominal debt service relief.  The objective is to have all those countries which are likely to need relief in the process by the year 2000.</P>
      <P>Ireland has welcomed the initiative and supported efforts to make it more flexible and inclusive, particularly in relation to adequate account being taken of countries' efforts to implement programmes and also of social as opposed to economic and financial criteria for qualifying for relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier inclusion of countries or increasing the extent of relief will increase the cost of the initiative. The focus in Washington was to ensure that adequate funding was in place to implement the initiative and that those countries which could <Col N="332" /> benefit from it had appropriate programmes in place by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the measures in support of Third World debt relief which the Government adopted last month. These have allowed Ireland to move from its advocacy role in relation to debt relief and become a direct contributor to the HIPC initiative. They will give Ministers increased moral authority to call for increased efforts by the international community to reduce the burden of debt on third countries to the greatest extent possible. The Deputy will see that this is precisely what I have done in my speech to the annual meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I have got a slightly different answer.  Will the Minister consider bringing forward proposals given that Ireland, through its development and missionary activities, has a strong record in third countries?  Is the Minister aware that in Tanzania 40 per cent of people die before their 35th birthday?  Is he also aware Tanzania spends six times as much on servicing debt as on the health services?  Is he aware that 100,000 children die annually in Ethiopia from diseases that are easily preventable with a proper public health programme and that it spends four times as much on servicing its debt as on health services?  Is he aware that in Zambia, which is debt ridden, servicing the external debt accounts for five times as much as total expenditure on education?  In view of our strong record in these matters will the Minister take an initiative? The HIPC initiative was a cause for great rejoicing in 1996 but it is not as effective as anticipated by those who planned it.  Will the Minister develop an Irish position to ensure that before debt is calculated an appropriate amount of funding is allowed to the domestic Government in order that at least minimal health and education services can be provided?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the various points raised and of the Deputy's concern in this area.  I noted before I went to the annual meeting of the IMF that he launched a Trocaire initiative. Last month I put forward a package which formed the basis of my speech in Washington &mdash; a copy of which I can supply to the Deputy &mdash; and I committed a total of £31.5 million to the most heavily indebted poor countries.  Ireland has an excellent record in this area.  This is a fresh initiative. In my speech at Washington I called for deeper debt relief if that was possible.  I have told the Debt and Development Coalition which came to see me before going to Washington that I <Col N="333" /> would not call for the absolute cancellation of debt.  There is no hope of getting that through the international institutions nor would it be advisable. However, that does not preclude any individual debtor country from relieving, to the maximum extent possible, the amount of debt in these countries.  Some people in the Debt and Development Coalition want to take that further step but it is neither pragmatic nor feasible.  I do not know whether the Deputy advocates going that far.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his Department has reviewed the effects of the income tax measures which he introduced in the 1998 budget on lower and middle income groups; if he has satisfied himself that there was a substantial benefit for both income groups; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I introduced a significant personal tax package amounting to £517 million in this year's budget.  The main elements of this package were a sizeable increase in personal allowances, reductions in both the standard rate and higher rate of income tax and an increase in the weekly PRSI allowance.</P>
      <P>Measures of particular benefit to lower and middle income groups accounted for most of the package and included, in addition to those already listed, widening of the standard rate bands, increased exemption limits and an increase in the threshold for the payment of levies.</P>
      <P>The effects of these measures were fully considered in advance of the budget.  However, in assessing the impact of these measures, it is important to take account also of the change made to the family income supplement which will now be calculated on a net basis.  The tables included in the budget documentation set out the impact of these measures on a range of income groups.  These show clearly that all taxpayers will gain from the changes described &mdash; with the improvements for those on low to middle incomes ranging from 2 per cent to 6 per cent when account is taken of FIS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the lower and middle income groups derived substantial benefit from the income tax measures introduced in the last budget.  The increase in personal allowances succeeded in bringing a substantial number of people <Col N="334" />&mdash; about 30,000 &mdash; out of the marginal relief system and into the normal tax code.  This measure is in line with the proposal by the expert group on the integration of the tax and welfare systems to effectively abolish the marginal relief system over time, because of its potential to generate poverty traps.  This cohort of 30,000 low earners will now face a marginal tax rate of 24 per cent rather than the 40 per cent rate in the marginal relief system.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 2 per cent in the standard rate of income tax to 24 per cent is of significant benefit to workers on low and middle incomes.  For instance, single people earning an annual income of £15,000, around the average industrial wage, actually received an increase of £8 in their weekly pay packets.  Many families on low earnings cannot be assisted by tax measures as they are outside the tax net.  Such families will benefit from the increases I announced in the thresholds for the payment of FIS.  Low and middle income families who are in the tax net will benefit significantly from the move to calculate FIS payments on a net income basis.  For instance, a two-child family with annual earnings of £12,000 will get an increase in their weekly FIS payment of £16 &mdash; from £5 to £21 per week.</P>
    <P>The reduction of the top rate of income tax to 46 per cent, although the focus of much attention, cost just one fifth of the overall income tax package. Many middle income earners will benefit from the reduction in the rate of income tax applying to any additional earnings arising from pay rises or overtime.</P>
    <P>When comparing gains from budgetary measures, account should also be taken of measures, outside the basic tax packages, to restrict tax reliefs used mainly by people on higher incomes.  In this context, I point to restrictions on the use of BES and capital allowances. These measures limit the tax shelters available to those on higher incomes.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the Partnership 2000 agreement on pay and tax clearly set out that whatever concessions provided will be for the lower and middle income groups by increasing tax bands and personal allowances?  How can he reconcile the figures, provided by the Conference of Religious of Ireland, which indicate that 4,198 single persons in the £40,000-£50,000 income bracket benefit three times more than the 84,000 single people on the £10,000 income bracket and that 36,253 married taxpayers, earning between £40,000 and £50,000, benefit twice as much as 78,375 married income taxpayers on incomes of between £20,000 and £25,000?  The figures show there was a disproportionate benefit to people in higher income groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Deputy quoted from CoRI, which is one of my favourite lobby groups, as Deputy McDowell and Deputy Noonan know.  I do not agree with the figures put <Col N="335" /> forward because, as I said in my reply, when account is taken of the budget changes to the calculation of FIS, people on low and middle incomes received increases of between 2 per cent to 6 per cent.  I do not subscribe to the view that the only way to deal with taxation is through bands and allowances.  I am on record both inside and outside the House on this issue and there is no need to restate my views.  Partnership 2000 envisages that over three budgets total personal tax concessions would amount to £900 million. That has been achieved over two budgets, the 1997 budget and my budget of last year.  Having fulfilled the terms of Partnership 2000, in the forthcoming budget I intend to concentrate my attention on low and middle income earners and to fulfil the programme as set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium, a joint document produced by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister explain why 39 per cent of taxpayers are paying at the higher rate after his budget, whereas only 37 per cent did so before it?  The programme for Government stated that 80 per cent of taxpayers would pay at the lower rate, but the Minister has some way to go if the last budget resulted in an increase in the number of higher rate taxpayers.  How does he reconcile this?</P>

      <P>That is a stated objective of An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The main reason for the increased number of taxpayers in the higher bracket &mdash; which is now a lower rate than when I became Minister for Finance &mdash; is the growth in the economy and the consequent growth in incomes.

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigations into allegations made against National Irish Bank have been the subject of a number of communications and, in the absence of a clearer indication of what specifically the Deputy is looking for, I will list these.  This may not be what the Deputy wanted but it is the only way I can answer the question. <Col N="336" /> I should point out at the outset that, given the time available and the amount of searching which would be required to fully answer the Deputy's question, this list may not be exhaustive.</P>
      <P>I have previously advised the House that, following the allegations concerning National Irish Bank and Clerical Medical International, I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank on 26 January 1998 drawing his attention to the possibility that these could have exchange control implications. In that letter I also requested the Governor to make a separate report to me on the implications, if any, of the NIB developments for all aspects of banking supervision.  The Governor acknowledged this letter on 28 January 1998.</P>
      <P>The Governor replied to me on the supervisory aspect on 19 March 1998.  He confirmed the Central Bank's inspection of NIB, which was conducted in its capacity as supervisor, had concluded but he was precluded by law from revealing the findings.  Deputies will be aware that I have already read the text of the Governor's letter into the record of the House.  In his letter, the Governor reiterated the comments made in his letter of 11 November 1997 concerning the supervisory issues arising from the McCracken tribunal, whereby he advised that the board was satisfied with its legal powers which are generally adequate to enable the bank to discharge satisfactorily its statutory functions.  The board keeps supervisory procedures under review and tries to ensure they are in line with best international practice.  Nothing in the bank's inquiries into the NIB-CMI issue led the Governor to change any of the conclusions he reported last November.</P>
      <P>Further allegations against NIB concern the alleged application of charges on certain accounts over and above the standard charges these accounts should have attracted.  The Central Bank is undertaking its own investigation into these new allegations.  On 30 March 1998 I wrote to the Governor requesting his views on whether, following the result of the bank's current investigations, he would wish to revise any of his opinions regarding the adequacy of the legal framework for supervision set out in his letters of 11 November 1997 and 19 March 1998.  The Governor replied on 31 March 1998, advising that when the Bank's current investigations are completed, he will write to me again.  I have received no further communication on the matter from the Governor.</P>
      <P>In preparing responses to parliamentary questions for answer on 3 March 1998 and 10 June 1998, I received certain advice from the Revenue Commissioners concerning their investigations into the allegations.  The advice I received on those occasions is contained in the record of the House in the responses I gave to those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April this year my Department received for information a copy of a letter dated 29 April 1998 from Mr. Don Argus, managing director and chief executive officer of National Australia Bank, to the Taoiseach. <Col N="337" /> In May I received a letter dated 1 May 1998 from Mr. Ross Pinney, managing director of National Australia Group Europe, outlining what he described as &ldquo;progress to date&rdquo; in relation to the group's internal investigations being undertaken into the allegations regarding National Irish Bank.  I replied to that letter on 10 June 1998.</P>
    <P>In relation to the possible exchange control aspects raised in my latter of 26 January, the Governor of the Central Bank responded to me on 28 May 1998 with a report on the outcome of its inquiry to date.  This report was not conclusive. The Central Bank indicated it would pursue its contacts with NIB with a view to obtaining further clarification.  It pointed out that it may emerge in due course that the findings of the other investigations under way may have exchange control implications and that it may be desirable to await the findings of these investigations before concluding its consideration of exchange control matters.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the Central Bank's report, I sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General as to whether the report contained sufficient information in relation to possible breaches of exchange controls to warrant its referral to the DPP's office.  Advice was also sought as to whether it would be in order to send a copy of the report to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and to the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Based on the legal advice received, it was considered the report was not sufficient to warrant its referral to the DPP.  As the legal advice confirmed that it was in order to do so, my Department supplied copies of the Central Bank's report to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and to the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>On 29 July 1998, I received a letter from the inspectors appointed by the High Court on 30 March 1998 to investigate the affairs of National Irish Bank Limited, requesting a copy of the Central Bank's report.  I replied to the inspectors on 30 July, indicating that I had directed that the report be forwarded to the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and that in so doing, I anticipated that a copy would be made available to the inspectors.</P>
    <P>On 8 June 1998 my Department received a telephone message from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that the Tánaiste was in possession of the interim report of the authorised officer appointed to investigate the allegations and that no decision had been taken at that time concerning publication of that report.  In June, my Department received a copy of a letter dated 26 June 1998 from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, enclosing a letter dated 25 June 1998 received by the Irish Ambassador in Canberra from Mr. Don Argus. Also in July, my Department received a copy of <Col N="338" /> a letter dated 29 July 1998 from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, enclosing a report from the Embassy in Canberra concerning press items on a pending career move by Mr. Don Argus.</P>

In relation to the CMI issue, the Minister said that the Central Bank was in touch with him in March and indicated that it would get back to him later and that it contacted him again.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision would have been made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, not by me.  The Governor of the Central Bank responded to me on 28 May with a report on the outcome of its inquiry to date.  The report was not conclusive.  On receipt of the Central Bank's report I sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office as to whether the report contained <Col N="339" /> sufficient information in relation to possible breaches of exchange controls to warrant its referral to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Advice was also sought as to whether it would be in order to send a copy of the report to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners and to the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Based on the legal advice received, it was considered that the report was not sufficient to warrant its referral to the DPP.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, following receipt of the Report of the National Minimum Wage Commission earlier this year an interdepartmental group was established by the Government to assist in formulating proposals and a plan of action.  A number of Departments, including the Department of Finance, are represented on the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the implications of the minimum wage, the National Minimum Wage Commission did not examine the economic or budgetary effects of its recommended rate of £4.40 but advised that this rate should take account of employment, overall economic conditions and competitiveness.  In order to prepare an appropriate <Col N="341" /> plan of action, the group has commissioned independent consultants to undertake a comprehensive study of the impact of the recommended rate on competitiveness and employment, as well as those sectors most affected.  The study will also provide an analysis of the extent of the dynamic economic effects.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that a note given to him by his Department, which has since been released to me under the Freedom of Information Act, specifies that the Minister should stress that the £4.40 did not represent a Government commitment but was merely something that could be negotiated.

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 87, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>This reply concerning Structural Funds is fairly long and is, by necessity, a comprehensive one. The issue of regionalisation for Structural Fund purposes is before Government on foot of a Memorandum for Government and an accompanying paper prepared by my Department. The paper has also been the subject of consideration by the Ministers and Secretaries General group on EU policy.</P>
      <P>The House will understand that I cannot anticipate the outcome of the Government's consideration of this issue.  My response to these questions, however, affords me the opportunity to comprehensively brief the House on this issue. Ireland, as a whole, is currently treated for Structural Fund purposes, as one single NUTS II region under Objective One.  NUTS II regions are regions established by EUROSTAT, the Commission's statistics agency, for various statistical purposes but they are also used for the purpose of determining eligibility for Objective One assistance.</P>
      <P>Objective One channels Community support to the most disadvantaged regions of the Union which are lagging behind economically.  The criterion for Objective One eligibility is for a region to have a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms below 75 per cent of the Community average.  Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> now well exceeds this figure. Accordingly, the region of Ireland no longer qualifies for Objective One status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the eligibility requirements for Objective <Col N="344" /> One assistance were strictly applied, Ireland as a single region would simply not qualify for it under the next round.  However, the European Commission in its Agenda 2000 proposals recognised that it would be undesirable for a region to be suddenly cut off from Objective One assistance. The Commission, therefore, proposed that regions like Ireland would be given transition status whereby Objective One assistance, albeit at a gradually diminishing level, would still be available.  In practical terms, this would mean that Ireland would experience a gradual reduction in EU funding over the period of the next financial perspective, i.e. the years 2000 to 2006.</P>
    <P>Initially, a region in transition from Objective One would enjoy full Objective One benefits. Then a gradual reduction in support levels would occur until, by the year 2006, lower levels of Objective Two type funding were reached.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious that certain subregions of the country at the NUTS III regional level &mdash; the next level of statistical mapping below the NUTS II configuration &mdash; have not performed as well as the rest of the country in terms of GDP growth.  In particular, the subregions of the Border, the west and the midlands currently have a <i>per capita</i> GDP of less than 75 per cent of the EU average and are likely to be below 75 per cent for the reference period to be used for the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>This gives rise to the possibility of seeking to adopt a regionalisation approach to the next round of Structural Funding.  Under the most straightforward regionalisation approach, the existing single region of Ireland would be reconstituted as two regions, of which one could consist of those parts of the country whose <i>per capita</i> GDP is below 75 per cent of the EU average.  If such an approach were taken the region with a <i>per capita</i> income below 75 per cent of the EU average would qualify for full Objective One status, while the rest of the country would still be a region in transition for Objective One funding.</P>
    <P>The Government is, therefore, currently considering the option of an approach to EUROSTAT, the Commission's statistical office, with a view to having Ireland reclassified from its present single region status.  This move, if it is decided upon and accepted by EUROSTAT, could mean that a region comprising the west, Border and midlands regional authority areas would qualify for Objective One status.  Such a region would also potentially qualify for Structural Funds transition arrangements after the year 2006.  It should also qualify for a better State aids regime for attracting new industry for the years 2000-2006 than it would if it were in transition.</P>
    <P>I stress that, if a part of the country were to qualify for Objective One as a result of the proposed reclassification, this would not mean the rest of the country would be treated any less favourably in EU transfer terms than it would have been anyway under the transition regime currently proposed for Ireland as a single region. <Col N="345" /> The Government will insist that the non-Objective One part of the country would qualify fully for the transition regime, and we have no reason to believe any differently.  Consequently, if one region in Ireland qualifies for full Objective One assistance, the other region benefiting from the transition regime will be no worse off.  Any extra benefits for a region qualifying for full Objective One status cannot and would not be at the expense of the region in transition under Objective One.</P>
    <P>Overall, there will be a substantially lower <i>per capita</i> transfer of Structural Funds in the next round to Ireland compared to the current round. In addition, any region in Ireland which receives Objective One status will not achieve the same <i>per capita</i> transfer of Structural Funds as Ireland as a whole received in the current round.  This reflects the improved economic performance of the country at national and regional level as compared with the European average in recent years. More specifically, being below 75 per cent of GDP for a region is not the sole factor as regards share out.  Other criteria are equally important. In the final analysis, the levels of assistance to a region are determined by reference to its population, relative prosperity and unemployment levels. In regard to the latter, for instance, Ireland's unemployment rate and the unemployment rate of any prospective Objective One region in Ireland are significantly below the levels of unemployment in some of the more populous Objective One regions elsewhere in Europe.</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that the scope in terms of area for a reclassification is limited.  The regional classification operates on an EU basis and any new regions must be generally in line, as regards population and size, with the norm across the EU. They must also be geographically contiguous. This means the option of designating microregions, such as poverty blackspots within regions and cities, to avail of Objective One funding for those areas is not available.</P>
    <P>As part of the process of preparing the groundwork for the Government's consideration of the issue, my Department has intensively examined and analysed the various implications of any regionalisation approach.  Official contacts have been made with not only Directorate General XVI, which under Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has responsibility for the Union's regional policy, but also with EUROSTAT and Directorate General II, which under Commissioner de Silguy has responsibility for EUROSTAT.  These contacts have been useful in enabling an informed analysis to be put to the Government.</P>
    <P>In the event of a regionalisation approach being adopted, the regional administrative framework may require adjustment.  Such adjustment as is necessary will be the subject of discussion with the Commission and will take account of the views of the regional interests.  A major consideration is that the efficient and effective administration and management of Structural Funds spending, for which Ireland enjoys a just reputation, <Col N="346" /> must not be jeopardised, particularly in the coming period of declining overall assistance from Europe.</P>
    <P>I would underline for the House that the key point in regard to the next round of Structural Funds is that Ireland will suffer a significant drop in its receipts.  Regionalisation should help to mitigate this to a degree, but this will not be at the expense of the region in transition.  Against a background of facing a drop in Structural and Cohesion Fund receipts as compared with the current round, Ireland, reflecting its increased prosperity, must be able to meet more of its investment needs from its own resources.</P>
    <P>The Government has put significant additional resources into key programmes designed to eliminate social exclusion and improve social services in areas such as health and education.  The Government's expansion of the capital investment programme will continue to develop Ireland's economic potential, while improving facilities in social services.</P>
    <P>Our budgetary situation means Ireland is now in a strong position to continue these programmes throughout the country in future.  As long as we continue with the prudent policies which have played a major part in securing the economic growth of recent years, we should have the resources to make good the reduction in EU aid for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The negotiations ahead at European level will be tough and complex and are likely to continue for at least several more months.  The European Council in Cardiff last June did not involve substantive conclusions on Structural Funds.  While the European Council in Vienna next December can be expected to advance the negotiations, it is unlikely that any final agreement will be reached before the target date of next March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a time limit for submitting proposals for NUTS II?  If we do not have the submission in by a certain date does that mean we will not be considered for Objective One status?</P>
      <P>Is it possible for the Department of Finance to control the funds for one region, namely the west, midlands and Border counties, if it were to receive it, without actually putting regional structures in place?  Or do we need to have regional structures in place to receive that funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major arguments made in favour of sub-regionalisation is that if the entire country is given transitional funding between now and 2006 it will inevitably lose all funding beyond that time.  I do not understand the basis for that assertion.  Neither do I understand why it is suggested that parts of the country could not continue to receive reduced funding <Col N="347" /> beyond 2006.  Will the Minister indicate to the House whether he has received such an indication from the Commission, or on what basis that assertion is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has more or less told us that in the first instance this is a statistical exercise. The Minister also laid out the conditions the Commission will require if he opts for a regionalisation approach.  He said the regions must be contiguous and that we cannot take micro urban or rural areas.  What is the smallest region the EU would regard as acceptable?  Must we regionalise on the basis of regional authority areas or counties or would it be possible to take DEDs in severely disadvantaged areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Naughten asked if there was a time limit on putting forward the proposal for sub-regionalisation.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; because we have not started substantive negotiations on the next package.  Chancellor Kohl set out a tentative timetable in Cardiff under which these negotiations would be concluded at the end of March.</P>
      <P>As regards regional structures, the first exercise we will engage in will be a statistical one which will be presented to EUROSTAT, the statistical agency of the Commission.  To be classified as a NUTS II region, which Ireland as a whole is classified as, there must be some form of regional structure.  In the past it was not stated what type of regional structure was needed, so we can only look at what has happened recently.  The UK has negotiated Objective One status for some regions in the south west which have a light administrative regional structure.  There must be some form of administrative or regional structure but the detail has yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell asked what will happen at the end of 2006.  If Ireland remains a single Objective One region in transition, which is the current proposal as of July 1997, we will not get Objective One funding at the end of 2006.  One cannot anticipate whether funds will be available at that stage.  If the present scenario continues, we might get Objective Two or Objective Three funding, which is light compared to Objective One funding, which is the real money available to the Commission. We would be in a totally new category. There might be other types of funding available, but it would be small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Minister anticipate could happen if we regionalise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we break Ireland into two regions, an Objective One region in transition &mdash; the wealthier part &mdash; and an Objective One region, the intention would be that at the end of 2006 the Objective One region would go into the category known as an Objective One region in transition for the next round.  We would then still be able to dig out of the Objective One envelope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="348" /> This issue is quite complicated and I am sure people are making fortunes giving courses on this in Europe.  The peculiar name NUTS is the French word for territorial units.  A NUTS I region is the whole of Ireland; NUTS II is an Objective One region which is the whole of Ireland; NUTS III regions are the regional authorities we now have; NUTS IV regions are counties and NUTS V regions are micro areas.  To qualify as an Objective One region, it must be a NUTS II region.  Under the present rules, that relates to population, wealth, unemployment and other factors.  A small region cannot be given Objective One status.  Small areas are NUTS V and NUTS VI regions.  There is a hierarchy of such regions.</P>
    <P>Some European funds which go to urban areas, for example, will continue to go there, but they do not form part of the Structural Funds package and will not be influenced by it.  The smallest region for Objective One status is a larger region than a chosen area in County Kildare or County Limerick.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will not interrupt the Deputy again.  I will not allow him to do so.  However, if the Deputy addresses his remarks directly to the Minister he is being provocative and inviting interruption.  I ask the Deputy to address his remarks through the Chair.</P>

      <P>I want to assist the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in maintaining order.  Part of what is at stake here is the dignity and constitutional position of the House.  We were elected by the people and while the Minister may not have been very impressed by the arguments we presented earlier, it is disgraceful that he showed the House a discourtesy be being in possession of additional information which he did not impart.</P>

      <P>I thought I was doing so, but I accept the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's admonition. An insult was visited upon the House and its Members this morning because we were allowed to debate an issue without being given the benefit of information which was in the possession of people outside this House &mdash; I refer here to the media &mdash; before our deliberations concluded.  If the Minister does not intend to apologise and provide an undertaking that such a discourtesy will not be visited upon the House in the future, <Col N="351" /> I will seek to have this matter referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Minister can be arrogant or frivolous or he can do what he likes but we cannot ignore the fact that this morning he insulted the House, its Members and democracy.  He is a disgrace.</P>

      <P>The comments made are unwarranted and unjustified.  We are debating the Education Bill and, in that context, issues have been raised pertaining to children with behavioural difficulties and educational disadvantage.  This morning I informed the Deputy that the school attendance Bill will deal with a number of those issues and others such as schools keeping records and the obligations on schools.  During the deliberations on the Bill I have been extremely responsive to Opposition Members in terms of accepting amendments and resolving issues about which they are concerned.</P>
      <P>This morning I took time to do a radio interview. We had a press briefing at 2.30 p.m. to announce that the Government had given me permission to proceed with drafting the school attendance Bill, information which had already been conveyed to the Dáil.  We briefed the press in terms of the themes and principles of and the areas which would be covered by the Bill.  I did not show discourtesy to the House &mdash; I would not do so.  It is that simple.  The radio interview lasted about three or four minutes and did not go into any great detail.  It discussed the themes of early school leaving, the issue of attendance, etc.  That was the background to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That explanation is unsatisfactory. The Minister did not state the school attendance age was being raised to 16 years nor did he mention the national education welfare board in the House.  Those matters were germane to our discussions here this morning.  The Minister then went out and made this information available on the airwaves.  The reality is that he had no intention of imparting that information to the House before the sitting suspended at 1.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The fact is we would have left the House and the debate would have been suspended <Col N="352" /> without our being informed of these important changes.  This morning the House voted on an amendment relating to educational welfare, but the Minister did not consider it sufficiently important to tell that to the House or to the spokespersons of the main political parties. Rather he decided to broadcast it by way of a radio interview while the House was still in session.</P>

      <P>This morning we discussed the school attendance issue.  I tabled a parliamentary question as recently as yesterday on the school attendance issue and no reference was made to the fact that the Government had passed the heads of the Bill or intended to publish it today. The Minister left the House to do an interview about which a press release had already issued to the media for the 1 o'clock news.  It was carried on the 1 o'clock news.  It was not courteous of him to allow us sit here like idiots discussing issues relating to education while he was out discussing the same issues with the media without adverting to it here.  I share Deputy O'Shea's feeling that this was less than courteous to the House and bad practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">

      <P>I will conclude by saying that not only was this information, particularly that which relates to the national education welfare board, not imparted to the Deputies who were debating the issue this morning, but the House divided on the question of education welfare boards without having had the benefit of this information.  My criticism is that the Minister organised a media event and treated the House as a backdrop, a prop along the way.  He treated the House with discourtesy and he has not given us an undertaking that he will not treat it with similar discourtesy again.  I will pursue the road I said I would pursue.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have a problem with arguments being presented more than once.  This is a poor Bill and I will make no apologies to anyone for fully debating all of the issues surrounding it.  The Minister can show his arrogance, flippancy or whatever, but he showed gross discourtesy to this House and his behaviour was nothing short of disgraceful.</P>
      <P>To return to my amendment and the vexed question of entrance examinations, they should not be used to exclude pupils from school.  This morning the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea indicated that the Minister would not accept this amendment.  That is a retrograde step.  We must send out a signal that people will not be excluded from schools for any reason other than the lack of accommodation, the ground included in a later section <i>vis-a -vis</i> appeals to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. Therefore, it is contradictory not to accept this amendment or to take it on board with an undertaking to include the Minister's wording.</P>
      <P>The way the Minister has chosen to treat the House today, shows he is not treating anything seriously.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70a:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 34, after &ldquo;as&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;are provided by law and such additional standards as are&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 10 which deals with the recognition of schools.  It relates specifically to subsection (2)(e).  Subsection (2) states that &ldquo;The Minister may designate a school or a proposed school to be a school recognised for the purposes of this Act where the Minister, on a request being made for that purpose by the patron of a school or a proposed school, is satisfied that.&rdquo;.  Subsection (2)(e) states that &ldquo;.the school complies, or in the case of a proposed school shall comply, with health, safety and building standards as determined from time to time by the Minister,.&rdquo;. After the word &ldquo;as&rdquo; I propose to insert the words &ldquo;are provided by law and such additional standards as are&rdquo;.  The thinking behind my amendment is that the minimum standards that should be applied in all cases are those provided for by law.  Subsection (2)(e) as worded does not provide that safeguard and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 13, lines 44 and 45, to delete &ldquo;school, shall be deemed to be a school recognised in accordance with this section.&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;school, shall be deemed to be a school recognised in accordance with this section.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (3) states:</P>
      <P>A school that, on the commencement of this section, is in receipt of funds provided by the Oireachtas in respect of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the education activities for students of that school, or</P>
      <P>(b) the remuneration of teachers in that school, shall be deemed to be a school recognised in accordance with this section.</P>
      <P>My legal advice is that the format of section 10 (3) should be changed in line with my amendment to ensure the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; stands alone and is followed on the next line by the phrase &ldquo;shall be deemed to be a school recognised in accordance with this section.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment.  It is important that there should be some element of transparency in how the Minister determines the funding basis.

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 72:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The Minister shall ensure that, so far as is practicable, each Inspector is appropriately qualified to assess and plan the requirements of students with disabilities or special education needs.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to Part III and seeks to insert a new subsection to section 13 which deals with the inspectorate.  I draw the Minister's attention to the phrase &ldquo;so far as is practicable&rdquo;.  The argument that it might not be appropriate to apply the provision in this subsection to inspectors who deal with a particular subject was advanced on Committee Stage, but I am not convinced by that argument and I take a neutral stand on that issue.  However, it is important and necessary to include an amendment to this effect in the legislation.  People who have a deep interest in education for the disabled or those with special needs have told me that until the inspectorate is fully aware of the difficulties encountered by people with disabilities or special needs, the necessary changes will not be made to the system.  As the Minister said, people have had to resort to the courts to establish their constitutional rights in this regard and to ensure the necessary changes are made to the system.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of this amendment would not place a particularly onerous task on those recruited to the inspectorate.  To take a view other than this would merely perceive people with special needs as different from others.  Education must be presented in an holistic fashion, it must be inclusive.  If the inspectorate is not part of the support mechanism inside and outside the education system, it will militate against the development of the type of provision all Members agree is necessary to provide the greatest possible level of provision and integration of people with disabilities or special needs.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  If that necessitates the provision of courses for those who may wish to become inspectors, so be it.  I am sure it is unacceptable to most people that the inspectorate is not fully versed on the needs and abilities of those with disabilities and the way in which the problems they encounter can best be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. Every inspector, when assessing the operation of a school, should know how children with special needs can be properly accommodated.  Various obligations are given to inspectors under subsection (3)(a)(i) when they visit schools to evaluate their organisation and standards.  It is important that they have the additional perspective of understanding the needs of children with disabilities and special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say the wording &ldquo;appropriately <Col N="358" /> qualified&rdquo; suggests a university qualification. However, the wording is fine as it will require the Minister or his Department to provide some form of in-service training for inspectors so they can get up to a reasonable standard, without rigidly specifying what it is.  The principle of this amendment is reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage when I outlined the reasons I was not disposed to accepting it. The Bill already provides that the inspectorate should have among its members persons who have other expertise, including expertise in the education of students with special educational needs.  This adequately meets the objectives of the amendment which accordingly is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister.  If those recruited into the inspectorate at primary level are not competent in assessing the special educational needs of pupils it is a large deficit in what is being provided.  I do not wish to raise the temperature in this debate but the Minister is not focusing on the essence of this amendment.  Parents of children with special educational needs have to know that when this Bill is passed the inspectors coming into the system, at whatever level, will have an understanding and appreciation of and expertise in, people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister has probably seen how it works as regards applications to local authorities for extensions for disabled people.  When these are referred by local authorities to occupational therapists and professionalism is brought to bear, small changes can have significant positive effects.  Will the Minister reconsider his position? I am not asking him to accept the wording.  The Minister is aware of what I am seeking to achieve.</P>
      <P>If we recruit people into the inspectorate in the Department of Education and Science who do not have the required understanding and knowledge of disabled people or those with special needs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to Committee Stage, to which I did not have a chance to refer.  Every inspector should have a basic understanding of special needs when assessing a school which has a broad range of pupils.  There are 8,000 pupils with special needs in the ordinary primary system.  There should be an obligation on every inspector to have some capability in this area rather than pointing to head office expertise or capability.  I am not sure the Minister has addressed the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That saddens me.  I know people involved in this sector will see the Minister's decision as a backward step.  In the Bill, as the <Col N="359" /> Minister is allowing it to go forward, there is no provision for everyone in the inspectorate to have the knowledge I outlined earlier.  I will have to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's attitude is difficult to understand. He spoke about the existing situation. Some inspectors specialise in this area.  However, <Col N="360" /> in terms of meeting the requirements of parents and special needs pupils, each inspector should have a level of expertise which could be used in a positive and constructive manner on their behalf.  The Minister's attitude is baffling and I have no recourse other than to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to a concern expressed on Committee Stage that the Bill should provide for inspectors to report on matters related to a school, not only to the Minister but also to the local partners in education. Amendment No. 82 proposed by Deputy Bruton covers, more or less, the same issue.  Deputy Bruton's amendment No. 83 is not necessary.  Section 13(7) already provides for inspectors to carry out their functions in accordance with procedures and criteria determined in consultation with the partners in education.  I would expect inspectors to be flexible in their approach through consultation with the partners in the performance of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused because the Minister's reply is quite terse.  As I understand section 13(7) an inspector shall carry out his work in accordance with procedures and criteria as may be determined by the Minister.  The Minister must consult about the guidelines but there is no obligation on inspectors, when they carry out such an inspection, to consult with the education partners.  As I understand it the current practice is the opposite.  Inspectors rarely consult parents in the conduct of inspections.  My recollection is that cutting parents out of such consultation rights was a major issue in the discussion on school evaluation.  All the partners in a school should be treated equally and it is important that an inspector should hear the views of parents as much as those of any other group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to ensure that in such a school evaluation, an inspector shall consult all the education partners in the school and take their views into account in developing proposals to assist the improvement of the school.  The phrase &ldquo;take their views into account&rdquo; was deliberately used.  I do not say that the inspectorate should slavishly follow the views of one of the education partners, whether parents, teachers, students or the wider community, if they are actively involved in the work of the school.  There is an expectation and an entitlement that the views of the partners would be heard by an inspector whose function is to help in the process of improving the school and not simply to engage in quality control in the old fashioned sense.  It should be more of a partnership exercise.  This is <Col N="363" /> an important principle and I hope the Minister does not say he will not treat parents as equal partners in this process.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 82 deals with reporting to the school and to the educational partners in the school on these and other matters relating to the activities of the school or centres, and the needs of students attending those centres.  In other words, people would not only have their views heard but would be made aware of recommendations that might emerge from the process of inspection.  That would make the process more meaningful and more in the spirit of partnership which the Minister has been at pains to say is at the heart of this legislation.  Many people believe, however, that if there is a disagreement about the role of parents, the parents will lose out to other partners who might be of the view, to quote the Minister of State, that there should not be a charter for busy bodies.  While that comment by the Minister of State may be a caricature, elements of that view come across in the Bill and that should be weeded out in this area.  I am glad the Minister is taking this section and not the Minister of State who I suspect would not entertain any such changes.</P>
    <P>These amendments would add to the Bill and the general spirit of what the Minister is seeking to do, although he occasionally fails to deliver in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will address my initial remarks to amendment No. 80 in the name of the Minister. As I understand it, if this amendment is accepted the functions of an inspector will be to report to the Minister or to the board, patron, parents of students and teachers, as appropriate and as prescribed, on these or other matters which relate to the activities of those schools or centres and the needs of students attending them. I welcome the thrust of the amendment but we need further information on the format of this type of consultation.  How will the partners, the spokespersons for the partners and so on be identified or will these consultations take place in a random manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 83, we dealt with this matter in committee when Deputy Bruton specifically referred to the whole school evaluation process.  It is not entirely true to say that parents do not have a role in that process. Because of the agreements we reached late last year and all the discussions <i>vis-a -vis</i> the establishment of primary school boards of management, with parents on those boards, parents now receive the reports that emanate from the whole school evaluation pilot project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment would alter the agreements entered into between the Department and the partners in education in respect of whole school evaluation process.  This is a delicate issue which involved a great deal of difficult work, in advance of the establishment of the pilot <Col N="364" /> project by the chief inspector and his team, to establish the bona fides of all concerned and to enable people to engage in the process both at primary and second level.  It should be noted that for many years there was no system of inspection at second level and, therefore, whole school evaluation is a different concept to the old-fashioned inspection type approach.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to insert in legislation a measure that would jeopardise the development of the whole school evaluation pilot project.  We continue to work to bring all the partners on board because at this stage not all of them are on board. One teachers' union, for example, continues to have difficulties with whole school evaluation and is not on board in terms of the pilot project.</P>
    <P>We must proceed with caution.  The objective is to establish a comprehensive system of whole school evaluation which has the agreement of all the partners and in which all the partners will enthusiastically engage.  That is the approach I intend to take when the inspectorate conducts evaluations.  For practical purposes, we are talking about whole school evaluation.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 80, we are including specific categories of people to whom the inspector may report.  We mention the patron, parents, students and teachers &mdash; the key partners in a school community.  That was done to meet the concerns articulated on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what agreement the Minister entered into, but if it does not recognise that parents are equal partners who have a right to be consulted on serious issues like this outside of sole representation on the board, it is a bad agreement.  The Minister said one union was not yet on board but the parents are not on board and that undermines their rights.  The agreement is not satisfactory.  We are trying to set legislation that provides a framework which is fair to everyone, and parents should not be left out of an ongoing consultation process.  It is ironic that the Minister agrees that parents should be told about the outcome of the consultations but that they will not be consulted about the process.  That seems to underline the weakness of his position. He recognises the role of parents on the one hand, but when they could make a creative input he will not recognise them for fear of upsetting someone else who is regarded as a partner.  Partnership has to be a two-way process and the Minister has not given a satisfactory reply in that regard.  His amendment No. 80 highlights the weakness in the position he is trying to defend in regard to my amendment No. 83.</P>

      <P>The Minister dealt with the question of school league tables and so on, which is welcome.  Education does not need that kind of environment.  Is he satisfied, however, that will not happen as part of the consultation with parents and the flow of information back to them?  I put it to the Minister that it may be possible to draw conclusions from feed-back on evaluations <Col N="365" /> which in turn might lead to damaging comparisons being made in local areas.  A certain amount of that is unavoidable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>While the concept of reporting to parents and students is welcome, I share some of the concerns expressed by the Minister and Deputy Upton as to how this flow of information can be developed.  My major concern is that there is a tendency for some schools to be adept at PR while others are not so good at it.  The danger is that as reports are drawn up, the information will seep into the community where it could be used for the advantage of one school.  That is addressed later in the Bill but this is uncharted territory.  The Freedom of Information Act has made this development inevitable.</P>
      <P>The fundamental point concerns the partnership of parents in the education system and amendment No. 80 is a step in the right direction. I fervently believe that parents need to be drawn into the system.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties and dangers with the wider dissemination of information and the wherewithal to be able to assess levels of sensitivity. There is a danger that if restrictions are introduced they will have a self-defeating aspect, but with those caveats I will support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I recognise, however, that we are putting into place the whole school evaluation system without resources.  The requests from the Department of Education and Science to get involved in training for the system are causing disruption in schools. It may not be identified as such but teachers are being taken out of the classroom to attend in-service courses on this.  Resources to provide substitute cover are not clearly identified as no one knows whether in-service training is official because it is on a voluntary basis.  The Minister admits that all the partners in education are not on board.  One of the reasons the TUI is not on board is that there is no indication the Minister will grant proper resources for the proposals involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The school evaluation pilot project is a good process.  It allows schools to evaluate their performances with the help of the inspectorate. I was at prize giving in one of the pilot schools and the feedback about the lessons to be learned from the evaluation project from the principal and the teachers was very positive.  The matter of resources is part of the evaluation process. The Department must respond to evaluation reports which highlight a lack of resources in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first period of the pilot project 12 schools took part.  We are now moving onto the second <Col N="366" /> phase.  The TUI situation is more complex and not just for the reason to which the Deputy alluded.  There are other factors involved such as fundamental issues of trust.  This is not a witch-hunt inspection approach but a genuine attempt to evaluate how a school is doing, from which the school community can learn.  It will take time to deal with that and to ease people's fears.</P>
    <P>I do not consider the agreement I made was a bad agreement.  I am a great believer in getting things off the ground and the chief inspector deserves particular praise for his painstaking approach to this issue.  I allowed him a major input into developing the process.  At least there is a project up and running, we are no longer just talking about it, and that is far more important than inaction.</P>
    <P>Parents, as members of boards of management, are involved but only as board members.  Parents' associations elect representatives to the boards of management and that is an important point.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 81:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 41, after &ldquo;centres&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and make recommendations on possible improvements including the resource requirements associated with those recommendations.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment picks up on what Deputy Burke said.  One of the key elements for a process of inspection and evaluation which will inspire confidence in the partners involved will be a recognition that improvements in school performance cannot be manufactured out of thin air, they will require resourcing.  If a school in a process of evaluation by inspection identifies serious deficiencies in remedial resources, home-school liaison or children with special needs, or in activities outside the normal mainstream education such as the need to bring youth clubs in to support initiatives in relation to early school leaving or community groups, it is crucial the inspection is not seen as looking at the school in isolation. The inspector must indicate honestly that there are resource requirements and these requirements should be heralded to the Minister, the Department and the public.  People will then know there is a recognised need in this area which is not only demanded by schools &mdash; which are always rightly putting forward demands for their betterment &mdash; but is also endorsed by an independent inspector.  That would give a great deal of credibility.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Burke said, if we want to develop this process more meaningfully the key is access to resources.  There should be a fund to back this exercise so that as schools are evaluated and their needs identified, a floating fund is available to the Minister to draw down additional teaching resources.  It would dramatically change the whole environment in which school plans are drawn up and the attitude to the inspector's visit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> In this amendment I am not committing resources, I am saying that the inspector should make recommendations on possible improvements, including the resource requirements associated with those recommendations, so that it would be a fair and honest appraisal and would become a credible basis on which a school could seek additional resources in the following cycle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty in accepting that amendment.  That is part of the whole school evaluation process.  The process is not just about making recommendations, the inspectorate must also make recommendations which have resource implications.  I accept the amendment in principle subject to the draftsman being satisfied with the terminology.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A previous example of where the Department made resources available was in respect of the transition year introduced some years ago.  The pilot schools worked in consultation with the inspectorate.  However, there are fears as outlined in debate on the previous amendment.  It is difficult for an ageing teaching population to suddenly change practices.  There is a genuine fear of the unknown and how the inspection might be misused in certain instances. I am not saying such misuse will be widespread but there is scope for it.</P>
      <P>While I support Deputy Bruton's amendment, we have an example of the transition year where inspectors and other people directly involved came into the schools and evaluated the work of the teachers involved.  That is a forerunner of what is incorporated in the Bill and in the amendment. There will be no fear, provided the selling process is handled properly.  It is important that it is clearly indicated that whatever resources are necessary will be put in place at the outset and there should be no doubt about it in anybody's mind.  If it is to succeed, it is crucial that the initial response of the partners in education is positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister accepts my amendment but I will be happy to withdraw it if he wishes to consult the draftsman before accepting the text.  The important message is that a block of resources be set aside each year which will be available as a follow-up resource fund to the process of evaluation and inspection. It is important that people know beforehand that there is something of a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  It would dramatically change schools attitudes to drawing up plans and co-operating with advice from the Department and the inspectorate.  It is an important distinction and one that is not in the present school evaluation pilot.  There is no block of resources available to be drawn down to meet the needs.  Schools must compete for resources and the Minister may not recognise their needs.  I am happy with the Minister's <Col N="368" /> response.  Perhaps if we were here for another day we would agree with much more.</P>

      <P>In supporting the amendment I agree a fund should be put in place for emergencies in schools where there are children with disabilities and child care assistants.  I am aware of a child care assistant who is being funded by the partnership but the money is running out.  Given that the child care assistant does not qualify for a FÁS scheme, she will have to be let go.  The person who may be appointed may not be as compatible with the child.  In emergency cases it is important that the Minister would have the necessary funds particularly in the case of children with disabilities who need child care assistants.  When a child has confidence in a child care assistant it is important that that person be allowed to remain with the child, for the duration of his or her schooling.  There are cases where the child care assistant is not being funded by the Department and we are endeavouring to secure funding from other sources.  If a fund was in place, the child could continue to go to school with the child care assistant.</P>

      <P>In page 16, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(v) shall constantly monitor and review methods of teaching Irish in line with the objective of greatly improving speaking and communicative ability;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still on the subject of the inspectorate. This amendment is a further function I am seeking to have inserted.  It is related to the question of the Irish language within the education system. We cannot be happy with the results of many years of substantial resources that have gone into the education system aimed at the revival of the Irish language as a spoken language.  There are many reasons for this.  The quality of work in our <Col N="369" /> schools is of a high order but frequently children emerge from school and go into an environment which is indifferent to the Irish language and the skills acquired at first or second level become rusty because of lack of use.</P>
    <P>The wider question that has to be addressed is how the population at large is to be educated on the importance of the Irish language in our culture, its relevance and how it enriches our lives. If we regard education as being a process in which we involve ourselves from the cradle to the grave, the education of the population at large in the Irish language is relevant and becomes more and more important.</P>
    <P>The areas where the Irish language is the spoken language are contracting.  I have no gauge on the use of Irish as a spoken language.  I am not sure if substantial research has been done on the use of the language outside our schools recently.</P>
    <P>Against the background of wider interaction between the inspectorate and the partners in education the Minister and the Department now have another vehicle for furthering the cause of the Irish language, not as it was done too often in the past but in an inclusive way which makes clear what our heritage is.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 84 seeks that the inspectorate should constantly monitor and review methods of teaching Irish in line with the objective of greatly improving speaking and communication ability.  This is extremely important.  There have been various initiatives in my lifetime on the teaching of Irish in schools and as technology has developed audio-visual aids have been used, but we are not making as much progress as we should.  The amendment is not designed to put greater onus on schools or teachers but to review the system, particularly the interface with the community, parents, students and others involved in the education system.  Some of the measures discussed in earlier amendments will provide for more accountability to the public, greater dissemination of information and accurate descriptions. A great number of people value the language and we need to increase that group.</P>
    <P>Given that a large amount of resources is devoted each year to teaching Irish in the primary and secondary systems, it is incumbent upon us to monitor what is happening, through the inspectorate, to ensure, for example, improvements in teaching methods are made.  Later we shall discuss various educational aids, such as books, audio-visual aids, etc.  There is a commitment in the Bill to a forás to focus on the Gaeltacht schools and Gaelscoileanna, but that approach will not necessarily prove to be the most relevant or productive.</P>
    <P>One attractive element of Telefís na Gaeilge is that it will enable the development of quality children's programmes.  However, there are great differences between the various dialects of Irish, canúintí éagsúla, particularly between the language as spoken in Donegal and in Munster.  As time passes, the language will become the same throughout the country, if current trends continue. <Col N="370" /> The various canúintí will become more standardised &mdash; not quite Gaeilge Baile Átha Cliath, as it was once known, but the same dialect will exist throughout the country.  If this happens, it will strengthen the argument for providing áiseanna not only to the 5 per cent of schools but to the other 95 per cent.</P>
    <P>My other amendment seeks to evaluate the overall effectiveness of all aspects of the teaching, development, promotion and use of the Irish language within the education system, and to report thereon to the Minister.  The key matter in terms of assessment and evaluation is that there should be regular reporting to the Minister, and that the Department takes a hands-on approach to what is happening.  I remain to be convinced that the standard of spoken Irish of pupils at the end of the second level cycle is as high as it was in the 1960s, which is the period of which I have most experience.  I hope the Minister is amenable to what I propose, which is that the inspectorate should have an ongoing role in making an annual report and evaluations.</P>
    <P>I will wait for the Minister to elucidate his amendment before commenting on it.  I have no hang-up about my amendment but there should be a statutory responsibility to make annual reports on the Irish language in the educational system.  A huge amount of resources are involved but the level of success outside schools is not what we would like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment No. 87.  I said on Committee Stage that the Bill did not mention that the aim is to promote excellence in management and teaching.  That is at the heart of this process and I am glad the Minister has provided for it, as he said he would, because it was strange that it was missing.  He has also restored the role of disseminating information, which was in earlier versions of the Bill but somehow slipped through the cracks later.  In this case the dissemination of information relates solely to the inspectorate whereas the Bill originally envisaged a wider promotion of debate. Nonetheless, this is progress in that the Minister is broadening the scope of the inspectorate and seeking to make it more focused on excellence, open debate and participation.  I sought such amendments on earlier stages and I am glad they are being provided for now.</P>
      <P>The amendments of Deputy O'Shea and the Minister concern the effectiveness of teaching development and the promotion of the use of Irish in schools.  I suppose the two versions are alternatives, although I prefer Deputy O'Shea's amendment No. 86 to amendment No. 84.  There is no doubt there are serious issues surrounding our success in promoting the Irish language.  Most of us have had at least 12 years of schooling in Irish but often find it much more difficult to articulate in Irish than in a foreign language in which we have had a much shorter period of instruction.  That proves there is something seriously wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> The Irish language deserves separate mention. One could say that paragraph (b) in the existing provision, to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the provision of education, encompasses every subject whether it be science, mathematics, English, French or Irish.  However, it is worth mentioning Irish separately because there is doubt as to whether we have succeeded in our objective, given that we devote quite a lot of time in the curriculum to it.  I hope this debate will open up new ways of looking at Irish and new teaching methods in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea also adverted to the fact that there is some degree of confusion about the Minister's intentions regarding support services.  There was a view, which the Minister sponsored in an amendment, that he would provide support services to the teaching of Irish in ordinary schools and in all-Irish schools.  He now appears to be reverting, in section 31, to providing support solely to all-Irish schools.  The argument has been made, with some credibility, that successful teaching of Irish in any school revolves around teaching subject matter which is not solely language based.  In other words, to teach Irish successfully one has to teach geography, science and so on through Irish, even in schools which are not all-Irish schools.  In other words, one has to incorporate the Irish language into other activities in the curriculum rather than just teaching it in the three quarters of an hour which is designated for the teaching of Irish.  That raises the issue of support services for both types of schools.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has indicated it officially, but I understand there is talk about having two bodies, one to deal with the Irish language in all-Irish schools and the other to deal with Irish in other schools.  It will not be a great outcome if we end up with two bodies working parallel to each other.  Perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to flag his views on that matter which is exercising the minds of quite a number of people who have great commitment to the development of the Irish language.  There is a lack of clarity as to Government intentions in this area.  At this stage of the debate it would be good to have them clarified.</P>

      <P>I question the effectiveness of the inspectorate to date in promoting the Irish language.  It has been too thin on the ground to be effective.  It has to be realised that there is huge resistance to the Irish language among the younger generation going through the education system at primary and second level schools.  I do not know the reason for that resistance or whether anybody can identify it, but it has to be tackled if we are to promote the Irish language as our first language.  Everyone realises, given the serious decline in the use of Irish even in the Gaeltacht areas, the great challenge that will pose, but I do not know how it can be met.  I support the sentiments of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had report after report on the Irish <Col N="372" /> language over the years on how to support it and make it more acceptable in the school context. Our first measure in making it acceptable was the introduction of oral examinations.  How effective have they been in improving spoken Irish?  Why is it that at 12 years of age we can take on one or even two modern Continental languages and make far greater progress in a shorter space of time than we achieved in the Irish language?  That is a very serious question to be faced up to by the Minister and the inspectorate.  It is difficult to say how it can be overcome.  Despite the vigilance of the inspectorate in promoting the language, it has slid down a slippery slope to a very low level.  Teilifís na Gaeilge, Radio na Gaeltachta, and the Irish periodicals, which have been favourably subsidised by various organisations with a view to promoting the Irish language, have all in turn failed to promote the language.  The development of Gaelscoileanna is an encouragement.  Gaelscoileanna are developing in the most extraordinary places, in areas where we would not have thought there would be an interest ten to 15 years ago. Some people would like us to think Gaelscoileanna are promoted only by certain sections of our society, but they are being developed across the board.  The Minister may have visited the one in Ballinasloe which is operating within the confines of a disused shopping centre.  I hope he will remedy that situation in the near future because that is not conducive to the promotion of Irish.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a clear opportunity to promote Irish when a request comes from the ground up rather than from the top down.  He has an opportunity to respond positively to such endeavours to promote the Irish language.  A quick response to such requests could turn the whole thing around.  There is nothing as heartening as to go into a Gaelscoil and see young students of six, seven or eight years of age being encouraged and endeavouring to learn Irish, and carrying it into their play outside school and into their own households.  If we are serious about encouraging the use of Irish, a very positive response should be forthcoming.  That is the way forward and I hope the Minister will respond.</P>

      <P>These amendment deal with the inspectorate.  Amendments Nos. 84 and 86 deal with the issue of the Irish language.  My amendment No. 87 is more wide-ranging and deals with a number of issues that were raised on Committee Stage.  Paragraph (d) of amendment No. 87 deals with the promotion of &ldquo;excellence in the management of, teaching in and the use of support services by schools and in the procedures for consultation and co-operation within and between schools and centres for education&rdquo;.  That issue was raised on Committee Stage and I am glad to include it in this amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (e) relates not only to disseminating information on &ldquo;the performance by the Inspectorate of the functions provided for in this section&rdquo;, but also to &ldquo;successful educational <Col N="373" /> initiatives which have been implemented by schools and centres for education&rdquo;.  If inspectors are aware of models of best practice in schools in other areas they will bring them to the attention of schools within their area and will promote informed debate on these issues.  That is a very pro-active role for the inspectorate.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) deals effectively with amendments Nos. 84 and 86 in relation to the Irish language. It proposes that the inspectorate shall &ldquo;evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching, development, promotion and use of Irish in schools and centres for education and to report to the Minister on those matters&rdquo;.  By and large, that covers the issues contained in Deputy O'Shea's amendment.  It is more specific than the other sections of the Bill which give this function to the inspectorate anyway.  It does so in a more generic way in terms of the generality of its functions. We do not specify subjects but in paragraph (f) we specify a role for the inspectorate in evaluating the effectiveness of teaching developments and the promotion and use of Irish in schools and education centres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised a point about gaelscoileanna and the promotion of Irish in schools outside the gaelscoileanna.  It is my intention to stay with the original draft of the Bill.  We are establishing a body for schools that teach through the medium of Irish at both levels.  The reason for the establishment of that body came originally from Irish language schools, which for years have been articulating the point that they have certain structural deficiencies in respect of curriculum materials, teaching resources, in-service training for teachers and various audio-visual equipment. Irish language schools do not have the same text books or material resources that other schools have.  It has been felt for some time that there is a need for a resource base for schools that teach through the medium of Irish.  We intend to establish a body to co-ordinate that and give effect to those kinds of issues that have been raised on an ongoing basis by such schools.</P>

      <P>We recently discussed with Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge the issue of teaching Irish generally.  If I recollect, one of the results of the meeting was that An Comhdháil would consult with the partners in education, particularly the teaching unions and parents, to get their views on the teaching of Irish in the gnáth bunscoil.  The primary school syllabus will bring forward a new curriculum in Irish which will lead to significant in-service programmes for the teaching of Irish <i>vis-a -vis</i> the new curriculum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be pressing my amendments. What they sought to achieve has effectively been covered by paragraph (d) of the Minister's amendment.  Having listened to the Minister, the construction of the amendment is a <Col N="374" /> welcome addition to the Bill.  The fundamental issue is the provision of the áiseanna for teaching Irish.  If we are talking about the 5 per cent of schools &mdash; that is the Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna &mdash; being provided with these aiseanna, a considerable resource input will be needed.  If, on the other hand, we are talking of not providing this to the other schools&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be of assistance by explaining that point?  When we say áiseanna we are not talking just about Irish itself as a subject. In gaelscoileanna, history, geography, science and other subjects are all taught through the medium of Irish.  There is an absence of textbooks and resource materials for all those subjects in schools that teach through the medium of Irish.  The point has been articulated for years that there has been a lack of resource material for all subjects other than the Irish language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very valid and relevant point but I would add a rider to it.  The availability of this sort of additional material in mainstream schools, which are not gaelscoileanna, for children who are functioning at a high level in mastering the Irish language, is equally desirable. Whereas I welcome the provision of such materials in the scoil na Gaeltachta and gaelscoileanna, I have reservations about it because we might be producing an elite through this system.  In a certain sense it could signal to the other 95 per cent of schools that Irish is not a big issue in terms of the standards we expect from them.</P>
      <P>We had a balanced and perceptive contribution from Deputy Burke who outlined the situation that we all know to be the case.  There may be better ways of employing the resources that are currently being put in.  The evaluation the Minister has agreed to in his amendment will mean that more comprehensive and effective information will be fed into the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is our objective in teaching Irish?  It could very well be that of Pádraig Pearse &mdash; moving towards the bi-lingual society.  People might develop bi-lingual facilities in the context of our membership of the European Union, where trilingualism is the order of the day.  We may have success through gaelscoileanna and the scoil na Gaeltachta, but if we do not address the decline in Irish on a comprehensive basis we will not move forward from the <i>status quo.</i>  There is need for a dynamic response to the Irish language from the population at large.  As politicians we often hear criticism about where money is spent on the language.  I am committed to the revival of Irish but in all honesty we are not achieving as much as we should.  If we go down the road of providing materials across the whole spectrum of subjects in gaelscoileanna and neglect to improve the provision for the generality of schools, we will not be rendering the Irish language a service.  One may ask whether the attraction to gaelscoileanna is the higher level of capitation grants or, in some instances, the lower pupil teacher ratio.  We could <Col N="375" /> probably end up finding the result is the same and that children acquire the Irish language anyway.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's amendment and withdraw mine.  The Department of Education and Science must be more proactive in instigating a widespread debate on this matter within the community at large.  If it is done properly and the Irish language and its place in society is examined, the climate can be created whereby the resources put into the teaching of Irish will reap a larger dividend. There should be no restriction on measures to support Irish language schools, be they in the Gaeltacht or Gaelscoileanna.  I accept the Minister's point about different agendas being served, but there will be a basis of material which will be either common to all schools within the system or appropriate to children achieving a high standard of Irish in national schools.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any empirical evidence that the standard of Irish of children leaving primary schools is any lower than that of those leaving gaelscoileanna.  Many mainstream schools achieve a high level of proficiency in Irish and that fact can sometimes be lost sight of.  The main problem is the attitude to Irish beyond the school and the unwelcome environment for children who want to use the language.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 85:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) to publish each a report on its work and on its findings in relation to the strengths and weaknesses of the Irish education system;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an important amendment to which I hope the Minister accedes.  It asks that the inspectorate publish an annual report on its work and findings relating to the strengths and weaknesses of the education system.  It is important there be such a report to examine issues such as standards, achievements and progress in the system.  It is remarkable that, while we occasionally participate in OECD sponsored research work on literacy and standards of mathematics, English and science, such research is not carried out on a systematic basis here nor are reports produced from within the system concerning issues which go to its core.  Now that a formal legislative basis is being given to the inspectorate giving it a remit to examine many issues, such as those we have discussed relating to the Irish language, it is important that the benefit of this be capitalised upon by requesting the inspectorate to publish an annual report in which it sets out its findings fairly and fearlessly regarding what it believes are the strengths and weaknesses of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would promote a healthy debate and perhaps move it away from issues, such as ratios of one thing to another, towards more substantive issues, such as what is being achieved.  It would be a positive development which would open up an area <Col N="376" /> of the debate in which parents could participate more meaningfully because these are matters which greatly concern them.  There must be a mechanism to determine what is being achieved by the education system, what progress is being made and where it is not being made.  It would be a spur to all with a say in the education system to redouble their efforts and focus on important issues.  I hope the amendment commends itself to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I enthusiastically support the amendment for the reasons outlined by Deputy Bruton and for others.  There is such a plethora of reports now that Deputies could not possibly read all the literature which comes their way from many sources.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>A yearly report is something which becomes more vital as time goes on.  In compiling its report, the inspectorate should bear in mind the Shakespearean phrase which states that brevity is the soul of wit.  Many of the reports we read contain an overwhelming amount of verbiage and the real information, recommendations and issues are often obscured.  I see the report compiled by the inspectorate as being brief.</P>
      <P>Since I became Labour Party spokesman on education, issues have been brought to my attention about which I was not previously aware.  For example, there is concern about science and the teaching of it at second level.  This is something to which the Minister has given substantial attention. The point made to me concerned the difficulty in the current economic climate of attracting science graduates into education and, more importantly, holding on to them as there are many career opportunities available in what is a vibrant private sector.  The other issue related to how the points system can be manipulated so that subjects not as demanding as science subjects will be sat by students to increase their points rating. However, I wish to be positive and I take on board and welcome the work the Minister has carried out on the points system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the important feature of the yearly reports is that they will flag problems at an early stage.  Publishing the reports and making them available to the social partners and to those involved in economic planning generally is important.  I see the reports being published shortly after the end of the examination cycle when the results are published.  Examinations must be accepted as an integral part of the school year, certainly at second level.  There is a need to see and evaluate what is being done and to report fearlessly on the system.  I do not envisage the report condemning anyone.  However, if we are taking the wrong action, if, because of shortcomings in the system, students are choosing the wrong subjects or if the sort of decisions required <Col N="377" /> to progress the country's culture and economy are not being taken, the report, if it is fearless in nature, should flag such difficulties at an early stage.  This kind of report would put the Minister of the day under pressure in a way that he or she would not otherwise be put under pressure.  I am not making these points in the context of commenting upon the record of the present incumbent.</P>
    <P>There is an old administrative adage that information is power and if one withholds information one will not exert pressure on oneself.  However, the day of such behaviour is fast departing.  Irish public life is now marked by openness and accountability, freedom of information and full disclosure.  We must accept the way in which our society has developed.  I welcome the changes that are taking place.  A Department which can be critical of itself on a regular basis &mdash; if such criticism is necessary &mdash; is a good Department.  I am not stating that a document should appear which is totally negative because the positives must be highlighted to boost morale and provide thanks to the many people involved in teaching.</P>
    <P>We do not produce enough reports.  We commission reports and pilot projects &mdash; which are necessary and make an input in their own way &mdash; but we have not engaged in producing what I would term a &ldquo;cost-benefit analysis&rdquo;.  I accept that is a separate issue but such an analysis should be applied to the education system from first to third level.  We must be aware of our strengths and weaknesses.  We must not be afraid to confront those weaknesses because, if we do, they will be more speedily resolved and students, teachers, parents, the partners in education and the nation will benefit from a more open and brave approach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The only annual report we receive from the inspectorate details its involvement in the examination system. That report is regularly informative and helpful and it details the position regarding the effectiveness of teachers in so far as the decline in standards is highlighted by the grades they obtain in certain subjects.  However, it is important that such reports should cover all other areas of education because they would help to target areas of weakness in certain sections of the system.</P>
      <P>While such a report could be produced on primary and second level schools, is there a case to request that the inspectorate should report on or carry out a comparable evaluation of third level institutions?  Major resources have been invested in third level as opposed to primary level education. The system resembles an inverted pyra-mid because a high level of resources is diverted to third level institutions while the level provided to primary schools is relatively low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an obligation on the Department of Education and Science to produce an annual report.  The report of the inspectorate should form part of the annual report of the Department.  Otherwise we could state that different sections of the Department, all of which have important functions, should produce separate annual reports.  While I recognise the importance of the inspectorate, it is best to proceed on the basis of producing one coherent annual report involving the entire team within the Department. I have no difficulty with that report being critical in nature or analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the system.</P>
      <P>In terms of international standards, I accept that the issue of quality is central to our work. However, information in this area will only be obtained from our participation in international comparative analyses of students performance in various subjects at different age levels.  As already stated, I am committed to moving forward in that. Our past participation in international comparative studies has been patchy.  It is vital that we reverse that trend to obtain information about where Ireland stands in the overall international scheme of things because that relates to our competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The strategic management initiative and the Public Service Management Act place obligations on the Department in terms of producing reports. What we are concerned with now is the format those reports should take.  However, I would prefer the Department as a whole to produce an annual report on the education system's weaknesses and strengths.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister's assertion that a report, which he will launch, should be produced by the Department each year and that that would deal adequately with the report of the work of the inspectorate.  The inspectorate is being dealt with in a separate section because its members have an important independent function and they are seen as fair observers of what is happening in schools and have a role to play in evaluating the quality and effectiveness of the provision of education including comparisons with relevant international practice and standards and to report thereon to the Minister.  Essentially the Minister stated that he will derive the benefit of these reports being furnished to him and will publish what he believes is satisfactory in the Department's annual report.</P>
      <P>If we are to establish an inspectorate to pursue this work, it is important that those who have established their field of expertise should have control over the sort of reportage they engage in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>Each year annual reports focus on a subject of particular importance, which becomes a major part of such reports.  For example, this year the Irish language, literacy levels, etc., might fall under the spotlight.  It is important that we can be confident of the system.  The information collected should not have to be vetted by the Department's PR section and approved by the Minister in order that a nice annual report can be produced.  I would dispense with the Minister's report if the inspectorate's report could replace it.</P>
      <P>The work of the inspectorate goes to the heart of quality issues.  The chief inspector has a good reputation and will be seen as someone of standing whose comments will be appreciated and respected.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Shatter on Tuesday, 13 October 1998:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the scandalous increase in the hospital waiting lists, which on 30 June 1998 stood at 34,331 an increase of over 13 per cent since this Government took office, and the failure of the Minister for Health and Children to implement the broad range of reforms necessary to end the waiting lists crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion which sets out the scandalous position which now pertains in relation to hospital waiting lists.  This is a subject which impacts in some way upon every citizen of the State.  It impacts on the midland region from where I come and I will illustrate the significance and depth of the problem with figures.</P>
      <P>It has always been my dearest and long-held wish that the fruits of our economic prosperity would filter through to all sections of the community and not just be the preserve of the few who appear to get wealthier, thus accentuating the gap between those who have and those who have not.  It is my strong view that this House has a clear obligation and onus to pursue policy decisions which ensure basic vital services, such as health care, are accessible to everyone regardless of the size of one's bank balance.  Such a fundamental and important service as the health service must be improved to a standard that people do not have to wait and suffer before their needs are attended to.</P>
      <P>The hallmark of a compassionate, caring society is measured by how we treat the elderly, the sick and the handicapped.  In any objective test it is clear that we have failed miserably in this regard.  It is clear there is a two tier health service.</P>
      <P>The Government must change its policy of spending money where it is least needed and start building the foundations of a truly inclusive society.  Economic growth means nothing to the person who is extremely ill, who is turned away from a hospital or is left on a hospital trolley because of shortage of beds in a casualty ward. Nor indeed does it mean anything to the elderly person who cannot afford home care and cannot access a place in a nursing home because of lack of space.  What about the hundreds of people who are waiting on a call for a heart or other organ transplant?  This economic boom means nothing to them.  No matter how much extra money is put in their pocket, unless they are given that vital operation their life chances are left to dwindle away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People ask where will one get the money for the services.  That is always the bottom line &mdash; it comes down to money.  When the matter of health is involved, money should not be an issue. We should order our affairs in such a way that people who are very well off do not have their capital gains tax bill slashed by 50 per cent, from 40 to 20 per cent, leaving those persons better off. These people can already afford to travel around the world to avail of procedures which might not be available in this country.  At the same time we <Col N="381" /> say that we cannot provide enough for health care.  What good is satisfying every economic criteria which is dictated to us by outside bodies if we have people who are not cared for properly?</P>
    <P>With regard to the waiting lists, we now know the demographic trends in Ireland.  The elderly population is increasing.  Therefore, we need more funds to ensure that an adequate service is provided.  That is an unmistakable fact.</P>
    <P>The waiting lists are getting larger.  There were 142 people waiting for procedures at Mullingar General Hospital, as outlined in the Minister's answer to a parliamentary question, at the end of June or the beginning of July &mdash; that figure had risen from about 81 the previous year.  That is a huge increase, even if we are talking about a specialised service.</P>
    <P>To look at other areas, ENT procedures for the midland health board area are done in Tullamore. There are 559 children waiting for ENT procedures.  Governments have dealt with such issues by handing them over to committees or review groups and waiting to see whether they come up with an inclusive solution which will not cost too much money.  There is no need for a committee to tell the Minister what is wrong with the orthodontic service.  There are people on invalidity pension, disability benefit and unemployment assistance who have to borrow £1,500 or £2,000 to get a child's teeth looked after because the outcrop is less than 9 millimetres.  If it is 8.5 millimetres, it will not be funded by the State.  Is it not time we eliminated such a restriction?  This is a problem that arises every day of the week and we should find a solution to it.  Those parameters for eligibility for orthodontic service have not been changed since the late 1970s or early 1980s.</P>
    <P>A review group has been looking at the matter for the best part of 12 months but it still has not reported.  The Minister should ask any mother or father what is the solution and he or she will tell him quickly.  If he goes to the principal orthodontic or dental surgeon in any of the health board areas, he or she will tell him that the problem is a lack of finance.  No matter how good a case the Minister makes, they will tell him that they need more resources.</P>
    <P>The waiting lists are actually much longer than they seem.  If everybody who needed treatments such as orthodontic treatment were included, the lists would be colossal.  We fob people off by creating an artificial cut-off point for eligibility. When a person on social welfare must borrow £1,500 or £2,000 to look after a child's teeth, who are we codding?  We hear meaningless guff about the Celtic tiger while half the people who should be eligible for treatment are excluded.</P>
    <P>The issue of hip operations, for example, is one which arises time and again at every Deputy's clinic.  When Deputy Howlin was Minister for Health and Children, he tackled the root of this problem.  It is a matter of providing resources. There are not enough consultants to carry out the operations here, but Deputy Howlin showed what <Col N="382" /> could be done.  There is no excuse.  People should not have to wait more than six months on a waiting list for an operation.  The fact that such people are on medical cards shows the unfairness of the system.  Some people have to wait 15 to 18 months for an operation.  I know of people on medical cards who have been waiting a long time and it is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>All of the health services are being affected by this backlog and patients across the country are suffering as a result.  We are developing a two tier medical system, where those who cannot afford private insurance are being forced to wait longer for vital operations such as heart surgery.</P>
    <P>There are figures from the Revenue Commissioners to show record tax receipts which have boosted the Exchequer to unprecedented levels. There is palpable anger among the general public that, despite strong Exchequer returns, hospital and health boards are required to streamline their operations in order to save money.  For too long interminable waiting lists and inadequate budgets have plagued the health services.  The strong economic performance means we have the material resources to invest in the health services and transform health care in Ireland once and for all.  We should stop paying lip service to the problem and ensure the necessary resources are allocated.</P>

      <P>I want to share my time with Deputies Hanafin, McGuinness, Daly, O'Flynn and Moynihan.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to address this important issue. I agree with some of what Deputy Penrose said. When Fianna Fáil and Labour were in Government an initiative was taken which put £20 million into tackling the waiting lists in the first year and £10 million in the second year.  There was an improvement and the numbers on the waiting lists fell from approximately 40,000 to approximately 24,000.  However, the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left Government took its eye off the ball on this issue.  Perhaps it thought it would go away, but that is not what happened because there was a 33 per cent increase in the number of people on the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>We should not blame each other on this.  It has not been nor will it ever be a simple issue.  It will not be solved in the long-term solely by throwing money at it.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you did a lot of good work as Minister for Health, which unfortunately was not appreciated at the time, and you created a basis for a great improvement in the health service when money was available.</P>
      <P>We must look at this problem in its totality. Everybody wants a good health service.  We all want to feel that if our families or friends are sick there will be a health service to deal with problems that arise.  It should not be used as a political football.  Waiting lists are a problem in practically all countries.  The Minister referred to waiting times, which have decreased in cardiac and general surgery and in other areas.  We should recognise that positive development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> There are reasons for the increase in the numbers on waiting lists in recent years and it is not simply a question of money because funding has increased since the Government took office.  The population has increased by 150,000 and we have an older population with greater needs.  The Minister referred to a recent survey which indicates that 3.5 per cent of all acute hospital in-patient beds were occupied by patients who, through no fault of their own, should not be there.  If that was addressed 150,000 bed days per year would be freed, which would improve the situation.  There are other reasons for the increases, including breakthroughs in medicine and treatment which have increased demand in hospitals.</P>
    <P>The Minister's job is to address this issue in the most comprehensive way he can and I believe he is doing so.  He is working on the waiting list initiative, which was introduced many years ago and which has proven to be a success.  He has also increased the spending of the previous Government and he has established a review group on the waiting lists, comprising people at the coal face and officials from the Department.  They have produced good initiatives and I hope and am confident the Minister will implement many of them over the coming period and in the budget.</P>
    <P>The review group has made a couple of critical recommendations.  In its long-term objectives from 1999 to 2001 it has focused primarily on freeing acute hospital beds.  Its recommendations include the development of geriatric day hospitals and rehabilitation facilities on the site of acute hospitals and the development of a planned programme of investment in appropriate facilities for those in need of long-term care.  It has also recommended that the provision of stand alone day surgery units on the site of acute hospitals for acute patients should be examined closely.  It has proven to be very popular in the US.  The review group goes on to say the question of providing additional hospitals and other short-term accommodation for patients who do not otherwise need to stay overnight in an acute bed should be pursued as a means of reducing unnecessary hospital stays.</P>
    <P>I am confident the Minister will address this in a comprehensive way which will, I hope, ensure that once it is resolved now and in the coming year it will not re-emerge in a few years.  The problem cannot be resolved by throwing money at it.  The situation is far more complex, nevertheless, I am confident the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, will tackle it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHanafin" hpid="Ms Hanafin Ms Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Ms Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>The success of the health service depends on co-operation at local level.  In areas like the size of the city of Dublin, where demand for services is great, it is essential we have an integrated hospital system where hospitals can work in conjunction with each other to alleviate pressure and to reduce waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="384" /> The area of south east Dublin is particularly well served by excellent hospitals, such as St. Vincent's Hospital, the Blackrock Clinic, Loughlins-town Hospital and St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.  Given the co-operation between St. Michael's Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital I am glad to say St. Michael's Hospital does not have a waiting list problem.  This is a proud boast for a hospital which last year catered for 18,500 visits to out-patients, 29,000 in casualty, 24,000 X-rays, carried out 584,000 pathology tests and admitted 5,326 patients.</P>
    <P>St. Michael's Hospital operates a 24 hour casualty department 365 days a year and is able to treat 98 per cent of its patients.  The hospital is ideally situated, being in the centre of Dún Laoghaire.  It is community based and has a long tradition of service, having been founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1876, and has the ultimate in high standards.</P>
    <P>A hospital like St. Michael's, which is an acute general hospital working in co-operation with the larger St. Vincent's Hospital, is the perfect example of an integrated service operating for the benefit of the community.  The system which operates between them is an example for the rest of the country.  Waiting lists are reduced at St. Vincent's Hospital because it can transfer to St. Michael's Hospital where the day wards and the five day wards are filling a particular need.</P>
    <P>At present there are 25 young consultants who serve joint appointments with the two hospitals and this ensures that the best and the brightest are available to both.  Given that St. Michael's Hospital is able to provide consultant services in specialist areas and at the same time provide day care and short stay care facilities it complements the work of St. Vincent's Hospital.  It is essential, therefore, that this hospital be allowed to develop its services in line with the demands of its catch-ment area and in co-operation with St. Vincent's Hospital.  Will the Minister, as part of his overall plan for the hospital services and as part of the waiting list initiative, support St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire in its development control plan?</P>
    <P>The development of out-patient facilities to include minor surgical and medical procedures in conjunction with the continuing of the day care and five day care facilities will help provide a much needed service and reduce waiting lists elsewhere.  The provision of an up-to-date acute geriatric service to include the provision of an assessment facility and of a day hospital for the elderly would be of immense benefit to the local community and release the pressure on acute hospital beds.  The remodernisation of the facilities will ensure the long-term future of the hospital offering the most expert services.</P>
    <P>The way forward on waiting lists is to take a co-ordinated approach throughout the country between hospitals, all sectors of the health service and the community.  In this context, St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire provides the perfect model. <Col N="385" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and the Government for the allocation of £12 million in 1998 to deal with waiting lists at a national level.  There is no sense in throwing money at this problem unless there is an analysis at national level of the various waiting lists throughout the hospitals to ascertain the origin of the problem and how it should be addressed.</P>
      <P>In the South-Eastern Health Board area steps can be taken to ensure a greater and more efficient service to the community.  For example, the Kilkenny Hospital programme is now in place and has been approved by the local authority and the health board.  In reviewing the waiting lists in Kilkenny, which make up 666 in Kilcreen Hospital and 535 in St. Luke's, any blockages in the system preventing the implementation of the hospital plan by the health board should be removed immediately by the Department.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm if the Minister was to take a hands-on approach to every health board.  The situation in Kilkenny could be greatly improved if we were given permission to move ahead, develop St. Luke's Hospital and sell St. Canice's Hospital.  This would create the necessary finance to develop the services in Kilkenny and the surrounding region.</P>
      <P>There should be an investigation into the operation of the orthopaedic hospital in Kilkenny, which is located on a very valuable site on the outskirts of the city and which provides a wonderful service to Kilkenny and the region.  It has been allowed to run down over the past 20 years and was not given money to develop or maintain itself.  Only recently it was allocated £100,000 for a maintenance programme, which has not been embarked upon.  The hospital had adequate time to close down over the summer and undertake the necessary work but that did not happen. Indeed, some of the operations at the hospital have been postponed and the waiting list has grown to 666.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand some scheduled operations have not taken place at that hospital.  The necessary staff were in place and the theatres were in operation, but the consultants were not available. Why was that the case?  That explains why the waiting list has increased to 666.  If the operation of that hospital was investigated, it would be found to be highly inefficient.  It is a disgrace that successive Governments let it deteriorate to its current state.  In adopting a hands on approach, the Minister should examine the services offered in Kilkenny and consider how the plan could be implemented to ensure St. Canice's is sold and the orthopaedic hospital upgraded on a separate site.  As the hospital is close to the hospital in Waterford all those requiring this operation are sent to that hospital.  A case can be made for the provision of services in the orthopaedic hospital and its expansion to enable it cater not only for Kilkenny but for the greater region.  Failure to carry out the proposed maintenance programme for the hospital has impacted adversely on the <Col N="386" /> waiting list and I ask that the Minister investigate this matter.</P>
    <P>A number of the beds in St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny and in the orthopaedic hospital were closed during the summer months.  As St. Luke's Hospital is an efficient operation, during his investigation of the health board area will the Minister examine the reason for the overspend and the closure of those hospital beds?  If a hands on approach was adopted and greater efficiency was built into the system, we would not have bed closures during any period of a health board's financial year.  I support the Minister and the Department in what they have done to reduce waiting lists.  Much more needs to be done, but I understand the necessary work is being undertaken. I call for a review of each health board area.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I compliment the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State on the excellent work they have done in this area since they took office.  The problem is international, it is not unique to Ireland.  It has created headaches for administrations in many developing countries.  In some respects it has as much to do with management and organisation as it has to do with money.  No one knows that better than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who dealt with similar problems in a practical way, particularly when we allowed overruns in health board finances which crippled that organisation and nearly brought down the service.  That was dealt with effectively by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in 1987-9.  The additional £12 million provided by the Government this year will provide facilities for an additional 15,000 patients.  The mid west area was allocated £700,000 of that funding.  Waiting lists can often give an inaccurate picture of the factual position.</P>

      <P>Members will know from contact with constituents that patients may be called for operations but, for various reasons, the procedures may not be carried out.  Recently a constituent of mine who went into Croom Hospital for a hip replacement operation was sent home because he had high blood pressure and he had to go back on the waiting list for two or three months.  This caused him great distress.  Many people called for surgery have had to be put back on the waiting list because of weight problems and so on.</P>
      <P>It is important that a review body is established to examine the issue of waiting lists.  It is critical that its recommendations are accepted and that its report should be made available at the first available opportunity.  Waiting lists should be properly monitored.</P>
      <P>There should be more communication between the various institutions and the patients involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="387" /> The institutions appear to have forgotten that patients have telephones, some have mobile telephones. It would be a simple matter to keep people up to date on their positions on a waiting list and when they are likely to be called for their operations.  If that were done, it would avoid much unnecessary confusion about when people are likely to be called for their operations. Recently a constituent of mine wished to postpone an operation.  For these reasons, the recommendation that personnel in the various institutions should be assigned to keep people informed of their positions on waiting lists should be implemented and immediate efforts should be taken by institutions and health boards to adopt a co-ordinated approach to dealing with long waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Members from the mid west will be aware that there is a long list of people waiting for hip replacement operations in the region.  I compliment all those involved in providing that service for patients in Croom Hospital.  They do great work and are a credit to the mid west region.  The staffing and accommodation problems at that hospital have been dealt with.  Deputies from the mid west region will know that new accommodation was provided.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, must be complimented on the major investment in Limerick Regional Hospital which is critical for the mid west region.  We should not make a political issue out of this matter. Many people have serious problems which must be dealt with speedily.  The Government is making a major contribution towards alleviating the hardship many people on waiting lists have to endure in the way it is dealing with the matter.</P>
    <P>At a time of revolutionary changes in technology, it is critical that personnel in the various institutions keep up to date with those changes. These are changes in practices which would have been impossible to undertake up to now.  For that reason I support any effort by the Minister to provide additional finances to keep abreast of changes in technology, which will have a revolutionary impact on the provision of services in the next number of years.  We should encourage private investment, as was done in Cork, to support national efforts to provide facilities.  I will not go into detail on that because time does not permit me to do so.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation for the work done by the Minister for Health and Children who visited Ennis General Hospital recently.  In Ennis and Clare we know the county hospitals are critical in the provision of these services.  The provision of adequate resources and finances to county hospitals is of great importance.  I welcome the Minister's recent announcement about developments in Ennis.  We need about £10 million to bring the general hospital there up to date.  This will take some of the pressure off some of the other institutions in the mid-west region.  I appreciate the work the Department and the Minister are doing in this area. <Col N="388" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as anxious as any other Member to see a dramatic cut in waiting lists for hospital treatment.  I am sure this aspiration is shared by both Opposition and Government Members.  However, some members of the Opposition seem to be suffering from memory loss as regards the existence of waiting lists through the tenure of successive Governments over many years.  The last Government did very little to solve the problem and behaved as if it did not exist.  When one has no answers it is often convenient to turn a blind eye.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative which was launched in June 1993 was a positive step in the right direction. It is anticipated this will progressively benefit the people on our lengthy waiting lists.  We are all aware it will take more than a short while to do this.  One of the factors contributing to the delays is the significant increase in population in the upper age brackets.  People live longer which means there is a bigger demand on health services as ageing people need significantly more care. The end result is that waiting lists will inevitably be longer.</P>
      <P>I, along with the Government and the Opposition, wish to resolve this issue.  I feel compassion for those who must wait and want a humane approach.  I hope I do not have to wait until the Opposition do something positive about it.  It is easy to come up with brilliant schemes when one does not have to finance them.</P>
      <P>I have gone into hospitals in Cork city and have seen overcrowded accident and emergency wards and patients lying on beds in corridors.  I have seen the outstanding work being done by doctors and nurses despite staffing and space limitations. They deserve our thanks and praise.  I have expressed those views at parliamentary party meetings and they have been echoed by my colleagues. I have heard and read of the Minister's approach to the needs of his Department and I know the emphasis he has put on the need to tackle the waiting lists he inherited.  I commend him on his practical and sensible approach.</P>
      <P>He has conducted a formal analysis on the causes underlying waiting lists and waiting times. He is intent on reducing the lists and the time spent waiting.  He will do this in the context of the needs and demands of the Department of Health and Children.  This is not a case for an ill-thought fire brigade approach.  Because of the enormous nature of the problem, it must be tackled in a systematic and logical fashion which takes all of its aspects into account.  I applaud and support the Minister's approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister set up a broadly representative review group which represented all the health disciplines and senior departmental officials.  It was given a brief to produce its report in the shortest possible timescale, compatible with accuracy and a practical approach to relieving the waiting list pressures.  This was done and the recommendations deserve great merit and show a great knowledge and perception of the problem and <Col N="389" /> the means needed to address waiting lists and waiting times.</P>
    <P>Among the proposals were the provision of additional funding aimed specifically at reducing waiting lists in all hospitals, the provision of accommodation needed to cater for the increase in patients being dealt with in line with the review group's recommendations and the examination of the factors which stimulated the demand for health care, treatment and hospital beds.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the increase of 150,000 in our population since 1990.  The capacity of hospitals to provide in-patient treatment has not increased correspondingly.  Another factor is the new technology which ensures early diagnosis and highly advanced treatment methods.  This means that more people need treatment and more are successfully treated.  In many cases they are given a substantial increase in their life span.  While I am happy with this and we all like to see people living as long as possible, it is probably one of the factors adding to the burden of waiting lists.  We are paying the price of the success and dedication of our medical personnel.</P>
    <P>The report stresses the need for enhanced community care facilities to help to avoid inappropriate admissions to hospital.  It also puts the spotlight on the need for rehabilitation facilities to enable people to return to the community assured of ongoing care and treatment.  These recommendations are based on practicality and commonsense. The review group deserves the highest praise.  The Minister should receive the full and ungrudging support of the House.  I thank him for coming to Cork several times since he came into office and for the millions of pounds he has given to Cork hospitals.  The last Minister of Health did not come to Cork University Hospital once.  He gave very little to Cork.</P>

      <P>I share all Members' concerns about waiting lists.  However, there is no point in making it a political football and hurling abuse about what happened under previous Governments.  The initiative has been taken to review the health service to address the problems and ensure that moneys given to the health service will drastically reduce waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, in the past 12 months I have spent a great deal of time visiting patients in hospitals.  The standard of care and dedication of staff in the health service is second to none.  As public servants, we acknowledge that time and again.  However, it is only when one is at the coal face and sees people lying on trolleys at night when there are only 70 beds for 90 patients that one realises the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an international problem which we will experience more with the trend toward an ageing population.  The health service will need more resources from the Exchequer.  We cannot make the problem disappear with one wave of a magic wand.  However, a number of sectors must be <Col N="390" /> looked at when it comes to expenditure.  Accident and emergency is one of the major areas.  We must also look at hospitals apart from the main acute ones.</P>
    <P>Last summer I was asked by a constituent to visit a psycho-geriatric hospital which was originally a TB hospital in the 1940s and 1950s. Unfortunately, little money has been spent on maintaining this type of hospital since then.  I was appalled at the condition of the hospital I visited. The main acute hospitals are to the forefront as people visit them every day.  I was taken aback at the condition of this hospital.  The Department and the health boards should look at this.  It does not necessitate a major capital investment to ensure that hospitals such as this are reasonably well maintained and decorated for the patients who have been there for more than 40 years, so they can live out the remainder of their lives in reasonable dignity.</P>

      <P>There is a firm commitment in the programme for Government to tackle hospital waiting lists.  Until yesterday the public was in the dark as to what the Minister intended to do about the crisis.  I, therefore, congratulate Deputy Shatter on initiating this debate.  If nothing else, it has flushed out the Minister whose hallmark to date has been secrecy, silence and obfuscation.  Under his stewardship major reports on vital health issues paid for by the public have been censored or withheld.  He is media shy when hard questions are asked and defensive in the extreme when reasonable questions are asked in the House.  It is progress when he is forced to come in here to make a statement about his approach to the problem where the lives of thousands of people and their families are on hold, their health is deteriorating, some to the point of death, and they are living lives in suffering and pain.</P>
      <P>There are new and disturbing features to this issue.  One consultant in a major Dublin hospital recently had five cancer patients for whom he could not get a bed.  This is deeply worrying. Three had pancreatic tumours and two liver cancer, conditions which require immediate treatment. One had been waiting since July for an operation.  Twenty years ago they would have been operated on within days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another disturbing feature is the number of children awaiting treatment.  Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin has 56 children waiting for over six months for cardiac surgery, 47 waiting for over six months for cardiology and 13 <Col N="391" /> waiting between three and six months.  Caring for a seriously sick child is a heavy burden for any parent to bear but to have that anguish extended by months of waiting is grotesque.  It is offensive that children and their parents should be made suffer in this way at a time when the economy is performing remarkably well and technological advances are offering new hope to children.  It is ironic at a time when medical innovation is offering greater possibilities than ever before it is getting harder for children to secure treatment.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the review group was a welcome move, but it is a pity the Minister is refusing to publish its findings.  The objectives listed by him do not cover all its recommendations. The over-emphasis on information systems and policy statements has all the feel of a departmental spin rather than a response to immediate needs which a review group would produce.  Will the Minister, please, publish the report?</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for the Minister on some of the points made.  Waiting lists are not unique to Ireland.  All sectors of the health services will have to work together if the challenge is to be met.  It will not be easy to secure this co-operation. The reaction of consultants to the idea of new specialist posts is a case in point.  In its document, Democratic Left argued for a high quality, fast-track specialist training programme to provide extra and younger specialists.  Others have also promoted such modernisation, but I am disappointed consultants are resisting the idea.  They know better than most about the suffering and anguish patients experience.  The health services are staffed in the main by people of great dedication and professionalism.  We are fortunate to have them but there are many powerful vested interests.  They must be part of the solution rather than the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution was astonishing, not for what it contained but for what was missing from it.  There is an essential principle to which he did not allude, that is, the principle of equality, which is well established at general practitioner level, whereby a doctor is precluded by his or her contract from discriminating in any way between public and private patients.  It is disturbing that the Minister did not mention that our system of hospital care is fundamentally discriminatory.  All too often the principle of equality is absent from the acute hospital service.  Access to treatment is determined generally not by need but by ability to pay.  Patients who can afford to attend hospital privately have better and faster access to specialist care and a hospital bed.  Those who cannot afford to pay are forced to wait in the ever-lengthening queue and, in manpower terms, receive lesser quality attention.  Some, tragically, never make it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has presided over a steep increase in the numbers on waiting lists.  The statistics have been well ventilated.  The Minister, for whom I have regard, referred to previous Governments, <Col N="392" /> but that is a sign of weakness.  He is the man in charge and the man responsible.  It ill-behoves him that he continues on the arid path of looking backwards instead of dealing with the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Choices have to be made.  Population and medical advances create new pressures.  While they dictate that priorities must be set, it is the Minister who has the authority to determine the future of the acute hospital service.  The health strategy states, &ldquo;Access to health care should be determined by actual need for services rather than the ability to pay or geographic location&rdquo;. That is the challenge.  This will cost money but set in the context of our economic growth health spending is modest.  In European terms, the health bill is on the low side.  Yet, the needs of the population are not being met, not because the resources are not available but because there is a lack of vision and commitment.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the tragic human face of the statistics &mdash; the elderly woman in agony waiting for a hip replacement operation, the man who cannot see because he has cataracts and the child falling behind in school because grommets cannot be fitted.  I have been contacted by a young man who has been waiting for almost 12 months for injection treatment in hospital and who continues to work in a local factory even though he is in constant unremitting pain.  He is supporting the State by paying his taxes.  Yet, at his time of need the State is not supporting him.</P>
    <P>These people need action.  They need beds to be made available, specialists appointed, nurses encouraged in their profession, a ban on bed closures for budgetary reasons, changes in accident and emergency units, rationalisation of services throughout the country and the changes to which the Minister referred.  Most importantly, they need a service which no longer discriminates against them and which has at its basis the principle of equality of access, as promised in the health strategy and demanded of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The motion is timely.  The dramatic increase in the number on waiting lists to 34,331 in 12 months, an increase of 13 per cent, is unacceptable.  A total of 827 adults are awaiting cardiac surgery for in excess of 12 months and 47 children for in excess of six months.  Many medical card patients are now seeking treatment privately. I am aware of several people who required immediate surgery and who were advised by their doctors that placement on the waiting list would have a serious impact on the quality of their lives. There is now a trend for people who cannot afford private health care to go into debt in order to pay for it.  This causes great stress to such patients and, given the present healthy state of our economy, it is unacceptable.  To wait for more than 12 months for medical treatment is cruel and inhuman and should not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Regional Hospital in Limerick, referred to by Deputy Daly, 483 people have been waiting more than 12 months for surgery.  This figure includes 175 waiting for gynaecology treatment <Col N="393" /> and 197 waiting for cataract operations.  In Croom Orthopaedic Hospital, of 324 people waiting for total hip replacements, 75 have been waiting for more than 12 months and of 468 waiting for knee replacements, 342 have been waiting for more than 12 months.  Of 298 waiting for all other elective procedures, 236 have been waiting in excess of 12 months.  In St. John's Hospital, of the 286 on the waiting list, 179 have been waiting in excess of 12 months.  This situation is intolerable and can only be described as a crisis.  The health boards must be given the facilities by the Minister to deal with the situation as a matter of urgency.  The experience in the mid-west is replicated in other board areas, as we have heard from speakers on all sides of the House.  This crisis must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the construction and equipping of phases one and two of the extension to the Regional Hospital in Limerick has cost £40 million.  It is essential that funds be made available to ensure that the building is brought into use for the benefit of the people of the area.  I understand that the Minister has allocated £550,000 this year for the partial commissioning of the first phase.  To put the first phase into full commission will require £2.3 million next year. This will put the four main theatres into full use and ensure the partial commissioning of the ICU and the out-patients department.  Phase one should be fully operational next year at a cost of £2.9 million.  It is absolutely necessary that this money be made available next year.  The start of phase two will be commissioned early next year. This will include the laboratory, X-ray and accident and emergency departments and other services. The cost of this will be £1.8 million for 1999. The commissioning of the final phase for completion later in 1999 will cost £1 million.  The total budget for the complete commissioning of the new regional hospital in Limerick which was built at a cost of £40 million will be £8 million in 1999. The cost for a full year will be £10 million.  The expectation in the mid-west is that the intention of the previous Minister to bring proper services to the area through the regional hospital will be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for sharing his time with me.  I am glad to have the opportunity to highlight the reality on the ground, as outlined by Deputy Shatter last evening.  It is a national scandal that three new state of the art operating theatres are idle in University College Hospital in Galway and that this valuable resource is being wasted.  The Minister must urgently negotiate with the Western Health Board and allocate sufficient finance to staff and maintain these facilities.  In the Western Health Board area we have 3,500 people on waiting lists while many others have gone outside the area to get treatment.  There is an onus on the Minister to resolve this crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the sale of lands at Merlin Park Hospital should be contemplated to <Col N="394" /> finance capital input for the hospital.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, who was so vocal two years ago in demanding the reduction of waiting lists, is silent today.  Those vested interests who were priming him to speak then are silent today.  The Minister should urgently investigate that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is timely that Deputy Shatter tabled this motion.  Many people are wondering why, when the Government is projecting a budget surplus of £1 billion, we still have excessive hospital waiting lists.  In the Regional Hospital in Limerick, our flagship hospital, 1,300 are on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>The most shocking element of that figure is the 500 people waiting for cataract operations.  Many of those waiting for such operations are elderly and it is regrettably that such people, having given a lifetime of service to the country, are denied the basic pleasure of reading a newspaper. People who have had cataract operations are full of joy at the restoration of the small dignity of being able to read a newspaper.  Within the overall service, we must respond to specific needs.  I recently read of an African country where, in response to the growing number of people waiting for cataract operations, emergency remedial action was taken.  We must make a similar response on a national basis.</P>
      <P>Emergency measures can work.  For example, the waiting list was quite excessive over the past few years in Croom Orthopaedic Hospital.  Extra operating theatres were put in place, a fifth orthopaedic surgeon was recruited and the waiting list for hip and knee operations has been reduced. This can be done where an appropriate response is made.  Road blocks appear to exist within the health service and they must be removed.  In the Southern Health Board area there is a queue of people waiting to meet a neuro-surgeon.  Unfortunately, a neuro-surgeon in one of our hospitals died last year and the vacancy has not yet been filled.  It often takes a long time to fill consultant vacancies.  I understand there are approximately 38 throughout the country and if these could be filled the road blocks I referred to could be removed.</P>
      <P>Because of the buoyant economy people expect an adequate response to these specific needs which have been highlighted so effectively in the last two evenings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion.  As a member of the North-Eastern Health Board, I can identify with the problems raised.  The Minister was very vocal when he was on this side of the House.  He spoke about all the problems in health care and nursing and demanded that the then Government provide sufficient funds to cater for the thousands of people on waiting lists.  He did not tell us that when he was Minister he would allow the waiting lists <Col N="395" /> grow by 13 per cent at a time when the economy was booming.</P>
      <P>Why will the Minister not demand more funds to deal with this enormous problem?  If he is five years in office, and if the waiting lists grow at their current rate, there will be a 65 per cent increase in the number of people waiting for beds.</P>
      <P>I was in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan last Monday night where friends of mine and other people I know are waiting for heart operations.  I am sure the position is the same in every county hospital in Ireland.  At a time when so much money is coming into the State coffers, the Minister is doing nothing about this problem.</P>
      <P>As a result of this motion, I hope Fianna Fáil reverts to the views it had in Opposition on another occasion when it said that health cuts hurt the poor, the infirm and the unemployed. The Minister should look at the posters his party put up around the country ten years ago.  He should consider the welfare of the people waiting for health care and go to the Cabinet table demanding more money to care for those people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Shatter, Neville and Bradford for raising this issue.  The public perception is that our health services are in a shambles, with more than 34,000 people on the hospital waiting lists.  The waiting lists in public hospitals have grown by 13 per cent since this Government came into office.  That is an indication that the country is divided between the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;have nots&rdquo;&mdash; those who have private health care and others who depend on the State for health services.  That situation does not reflect the booming economy we are supposed to be enjoying.  It rings hollow to people who paid taxes all their lives and invested in State services only to find that when they required them these services were not available to them.</P>
      <P>The elderly would not have joined VHI or taken out any form of private health care.  Many of them now find themselves dependent on public hospitals and at the mercy of the health services. Hip replacement operations are needed by many old people yet the waiting list for this type of operation is one of the longest.  Many appointments have to be postponed because of seriously ill patients coming into hospital through casualty. Elderly patients are put on the long finger because their cases are not regarded as urgent. This adds to the anxiety experienced by many elderly people who already feel hard done by having paid their taxes in more harsh times than we are currently experiencing.  They are now just statistics on a waiting list.  The Minister should remember that they are people who suffer unnecessary anxiety as a result of unacceptable delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We often hear about doctors having to make three or four telephone calls a day to get their patients admitted to hospital.  I am sure many public representatives have spent hours talking to <Col N="396" /> the staff in the admission departments of hospitals.  I feel sorry for those people because they are taking the brunt of the public anger about this issue.</P>
    <P>Another very vulnerable sector of society is children.  The waiting time for ENT care in Cork is more than six months.  There are 53 children in the South Infirmary waiting for ENT treatment. Those children probably have to have unnecessary doses of antibiotics.  They will also fall behind in their schooling which is not acceptable in their formative years.</P>
    <P>There are 47 children waiting to be admitted to Crumlin Hospital for cardiac surgery.  The development of these young children will suffer because of this unnecessary waiting.  The problem of children not getting the surgery they require must be urgently addressed.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the invisible waiting lists for consultant care.  I met a constituent this week who has been waiting since last March for an MRI scan.  When the scan is eventually carried out he will probably have to wait to be admitted to hospital.  That person is not one of the thousands on a waiting list but he is suffering unnecessary pain.</P>
    <P>Approximately 60 per cent of the population do not have private health care &mdash; VHI or BUPA. The Minister said in media reports that he will press for extra funding for hospitals, which I welcome. With the booming economy the length of public hospital waiting lists is unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dwell on two issues of concern.  First, I welcome Deputy Shatter's motion and the work he has been doing in this area.  The motion does not just condemn but proposes many useful initiatives which he outlined ten days ago.  That is the kind of political response that is required.</P>
      <P>As the Government prepares its Estimates for the budget in early December, I hope it will focus primarily on health care strategies.  I understand the Minister has a difficult job to do in negotiating a package of funding for his Department but there is a realisation now that, for the first time, we can put in place a strong public health care system.  The opportunity exists because the funding is available and that opportunity has to be realised in the forthcoming budget.  I wish the Minister well in his task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues I want to bring to the Minister's attention is the situation in Tallaght Hospital.  The Minister visited the hospital some months ago where he saw that excellent facility at first hand.  It is a state of the art hospital servicing the new town of Tallaght and all of the south inner city area of Dublin.  However, there is now a crisis in funding for Tallaght Hospital.  In excess of £20 million is required in the overrun for this year.  I ask the Minister to deal sympathetically with the hospital when, inevitably, it comes looking for additional funding in the years ahead.  We do not want a situation comparable to that which arose some years ago in Beaumont Hospital, <Col N="397" /> where excellent facilities could not be utilised because funding was not in place.</P>
    <P>Finally I ask the Minister to look at the area of eating disorders.  I know this a small aspect of the entire budget and that the Minster has increased the number of beds to deal with this illness in St. Vincent's Hospital but it is growing, as many politicians and others will testify.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to address the House on the question of waiting lists and waiting times for acute hospital procedures.</P>
      <P>I would like to correct some misconceptions. Already the paediatric cardiac waiting list has dropped by 32 per cent from 102 to 69 patients and the adult cardiac surgery list has dropped by 24 per cent, from 1,496 to 1,142 from June this year.</P>
      <P>During the debate, a number of important points were made on the measures considered to be necessary to address the question of unduly long waiting lists and waiting times.  These related to medical and nursing resources; temporary bed closures; the financial allocations to the acute hospitals and capital investment in health facilities, as well as the organisational and structural issues required to manage waiting lists and waiting times effectively over the longer term.</P>
      <P>As regards medical manpower &mdash; the need for additional consultants and a new &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; grade were specifically mentioned in this context &mdash; in May 1998, the Minister for Health and Children established the Forum on Medical Manpower to develop and monitor the implementation of a comprehensive manpower strategy for the acute hospital sector.</P>
      <P>The membership of the forum is drawn from all of the relevant regulatory, professional, training, service and policy agencies &mdash; the RCSI, the RCPl, the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board, Comhairle na n-Ospidéal, the ICGP, the IMO, the IHCA, the health boards, the voluntary hospitals, the Medical Council, as well as the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>This medical manpower strategy flows from the national health strategy and is aimed at maximising the quality of care provided and ensuring that every patient who requires access to an acute hospital, regardless of what part of the country they are in, will have equal access to that quality of care.  The work of the forum will be ongoing and it will make recommendations to the Minister on the requirements necessary to ensure equity of access to the highest quality of medical care. In broad terms, the forum is currently working on the future structures of the medical workforce in acute hospitals and the future objectives and organisation of post graduate medical training. The forum has been asked to complete its initial work by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children found it necessary to take the initiative in establishing the forum as a basis for developing and implementing <Col N="398" /> an agreed, cohesive medical manpower policy, aimed at striking the correct balance between fully trained medical personnel and those in training, within the context of the current structure and configuration of the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>The work of the Forum on Medical Manpower is linked to that of the Commission on Nursing, which reported to the Minister recently.  The commission made a wide range of recommendations on the regulation of the profession, on professional development, including specialist nursing, on the role of nurses and midwives in service management and on nursing in the community, of the elderly, of the mentally handicapped, midwifery and nursing of sick children.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the roles and responsibilities of both nurses and doctors &mdash; as well as their working relationships &mdash; are changing and it is necessary to assess the new roles of both professions, with a view to putting in place the most appropriate and cost-effective service arrangements, including the introduction of nurse specialists, which are to the benefit of the patient.</P>
    <P>Temporary bed closures were referred to by a number of Deputies.  Bed closures are an annual occurrence in the acute hospital sector and the closures during 1998 were no more significant than in previous years.  This year, an average of 398 beds were closed temporarily and in 1996 and 1997 an average of 383 and 418 beds, respectively, were closed temporarily.  The level of temporary bed closures this year was not, therefore, a new phenomenon as has been suggested by Opposition speakers.</P>
    <P>Temporary bed closures are required each year to enable hospitals to carry out ward refurbishment and essential maintenance and they also facilitate the taking of annual leave by the staff of the hospital.  These closures are also relevant in the context of effective bed management which has formed a normal and integral part of the budget management of individual hospitals for many years.  The closures must, however, be set in this context of actual hospital activity rather than simply the number of beds available.  As the Minister mentioned in his address to the House last evening, in the period January to June 1998, total discharges for all hospitals have been up almost 4 per cent on the same period in 1997 and within this overall increase of 4 per cent, in-patient activity increased by over 1 per cent and day-case activity by almost 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say, therefore, that the record of the Minister for Health and Children and of this Government in actively addressing the needs of persons who require acute hospital services has been in stark contrast to the record of the previous Administration, who failed to tackle any of the issues.</P>
    <P>I commend to the House the Government's amendment to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I will share my time with Deputies Timmins and Shatter.  I thank Deputy Shatter for bringing this important motion before <Col N="399" /> us.  The level of interest shown by the number of Deputies who spoke illustrates the size and scale of the problem.</P>
      <P>I heard my colleague, Deputy Farrelly, mention the old slogan that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the poor.  That slogan was coined by Fianna Fáil in the mid-1980s.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, could take Deputy Farrelly's advice to dust the posters down and reflect upon them.  During the general election campaign of 1989 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, remarked that he had realised there was a health crisis.  The members of Fianna Fáil who are canvassing the Cork South-Central constituency now recognise there is a health crisis.  We see from the figures presented in reply to Deputy Shatter that there are over 3,000 on waiting lists in the Cork area. While the by-election campaign might be devoid of any great political debate, on many doorsteps we have heard from the people of the constituency that there is a health crisis in the Cork city and county area.  If we were to conduct a similar campaign in any constituency we would hear the same cry.</P>

People are asking how the Government is responding to the 3,000 people in the Cork area or the 30,000 people nationwide.  I am concerned, as the Minister should be, about the impact of this crisis on the elderly.  We see the figures for hip replacement and cardiac operations.</P>

      <P>The elderly are suffering most and unfortunately in the majority of cases they are suffering in silence.  These are the people who built this State and paid their taxes.  They are now waiting 12 months for a hip replacement operation and in many cases six months just to see the consultant.  The words of the Minister last night will be of scant consolation to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in this House have a duty to respond humanely to a serious health and social problem. This motion is not about politics, it is about real people, those who have been on waiting lists for 12 or more months.  The size of the problem must be met with Government money and initiative. We have not heard much initiative from the Minister of State or the Minister.  The year 1999 will be designated year of the elderly.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who has responsibility for the elderly, to put in place a system which will ensure they do not have to wait 12 to 18 months for basic surgery.  If the Government is to do anything meaningful for the year of the <Col N="400" /> elderly it should give a guarantee that they will not have to wait such long periods for surgery.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his generosity in crediting the previous Government with being in office until the end of 1997 which permitted him in his opening speech, under the introduction of a waiting list initiative in Ireland, to claim there was an increase of 33.3 per cent in the numbers on the waiting list during the lifetime of the previous Government.  If he had applied the figures correctly, the figure of 33.3 per cent would have been reduced by 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Minister, by playing with figures in his opening speech when referring to the waiting lists during the tenure of the previous Government, gave incorrect information.  He has listened to many contributions during the debate, all of which relate the same tale.  During his contribution he outlined his many initiatives to reduce the waiting list, yet it continues to grow. If the trend continues the Irish Hospital Consultants Association has predicted that by the end of the year there will be 40,000 people waiting for treatment.</P>
      <P>One of the more vulnerable and weaker groups in society are those waiting to go into hospital and often they are too concerned about their condition to publicise it.  As the economy grows there is a danger that our social conscience will diminish and those on the verge of society may be cast aside.  It is too easy for us to respond to large and well organised pressure groups and not address those most in need.</P>
      <P>By any standard the health budget is a large one, but I have serious reservations that only a small percentage is used on the treatment of patients.  During the summer I was disturbed to read in a provincial newspaper that a health board chief executive officer was closing a hospital ward because he had exceeded his budget.  Yet on the same day and in the same newspaper an administrative position, which many would deem excessive, was advertised.  In this health board area local folklore has it that the health board offices were never officially opened as their exposed luxury would be an embarrassment when contrasted with the facilities at the local hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many areas of waste need to be addressed.  I shall refer briefly to two, one of which is the <Col N="401" /> abuse of prescribed medicine through the medical card system.  How often have we visited a house where the press is lined with bottles of antibiotics? In Ireland, we put no value on something we get for nothing.  During the past few weeks I encountered an individual who, because of a certain medical condition, is continually prescribed certain tablets.  He obtains the smallest amount that can be purchased.  However, due to the expiry date he can avail only of one-third and the remaining two-thirds are dumped.  Are we slaves to the pharmaceutical industry?  Will the Minister look at these two areas to determine whether savings can be made and reallocated to more deserving needs?</P>
    <P>Deputy Hayes referred to Tallaght hospital. The charge for car parking facilities has been brought to my attention.  Given that the car park fee is excessive in comparison with other hospitals, will the Minister explain whether it is run separately from the Department of Health and Children as a commercial enterprise?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put this debate in the context of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto of June 1997 which stated:</P>
      <P>Health; we will tackle hospital waiting lists as a priority.  Our aim will be to eliminate waiting lists over 12 months in orthopaedic surgery, especially hip replacements, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and plastic surgery.  We will set a maximum period of six months for children awaiting ENT or eye treatment.  We will ensure that quiet hospital periods, such as the summer months, are used to make inroads into the lists.</P>
      <P>The statement was briefer in the programme for Government &mdash; I do not know whether this was the Progressive Democrats or the Fianna Fáil influence.  Under the heading of social issues, health appears under one sentence, &ldquo;Key priorities include tackling the crisis in hospital waiting lists.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have listened to much about what the previous Government did.  The reality is that under the previous Government the waiting lists were never at their present level.  The waiting lists at the end of June were in the region of 34,500 whereas there are now 36,500 people on the list. Each is an individual, an unwell person, and each has been considered by respected consultants and medical practitioners as requiring inpatient hospital treatment.  They require a variety of procedures. Some have life threatening illnesses and some are so debilitated that their quality of life is completely diminished.  In the case of adults, some are in receipt of disability benefit and unable to attend at their places of employment. In the case of children some are struggling with tonsils, adenoids and other problems.  Some miss days from school and are prescribed antibiotics. In the ophthalmology area, children have difficulty coping in the classroom and experience ongoing health problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> The reality is that the Minister has completely betrayed his promise of June 1997.  Waiting lists at the end of June, the first 12 months of his being in office, had increased by 13 per cent, while in mid-November &mdash; or perhaps December because of the inefficiencies in his Department &mdash; we will be told that the waiting lists at the end of September 1998 have increased by 18 per cent.  In excess of one-third of those people have been on the waiting lists for over one year.  Far too many have been waiting for almost two years.</P>
    <P>There were to be summer bed closures.  In the first nine months of this year 1,992 beds were temporarily closed in a variety of hospitals throughout the length and breadth of the country, more are closing as we speak and will remain closed until 31 December 1998.  This is another broken promise.  We are informed by the Minister of State that hospital closures are irrelevant, but they are not irrelevant.</P>

Deputy Callelly, who has tabled a variety of questions, did not indicate his dissatisfaction. As late as today Deputy Aylward raised questions about the closure of beds in the regional orthopaedic hospital in Kilcreene, County Kilkenny.  He queried the Minister on the reason beds are closing down and got some Civil Service jargon in response.  Deputy Aylward is concerned that at that hospital at the end of June there was a waiting list of 666 people more than 400 of whom had been on the waiting list for over 12 months and a great many of whom require a variety of procedures, including hip and knee replacements.  Those people have been suffering while the Minister fiddles and requests committees to consider what should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a reference to a working group looking at the waiting lists.  The report the Minister received at the end of August and which he has clasped tightly to his chest displays the pathological secrecy and paranoia which haunts the corridors of the Department of Health and Children. Why has that report not been published? We had selected quotes from it in the Minister's speech.  Parts of it have leaked through medical journals and into the national press to try to deflect attention from what is happening in the health area.  In his speech last night and in the <Col N="403" /> self-congratultatory amendment to this motion he referred to that report but, unfortunately, nowhere did he commit himself to implement a single recommendation in it.  The waiting lists are escalating and there is no guarantee from the <Col N="404" /> Minister or the Government that they will reduce, nor that the people who are in pain and whose lives are at risk will be offered the medical treatment and surgery to which they are entitled.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Adjournment Debate." RHead="- Fodder Crisis">
    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Fodder Crisis.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Many farmers in west Limerick are in danger of losing their livelihoods if there is no intervention to alleviate the crisis brought on by the disastrous summer.  Will the Minister immediately introduce measures to alleviate the crisis in a large area of west Limerick?  In this area only 58 per cent of the fodder required has been harvested and 11 per cent of farmers surveyed by the IFA have less than 30 per cent of their fodder harvested.</P>
      <P>The extent of the crisis can no longer be ignored.  The excellent survey conducted by the IFA exposes in stark detail the terrible situation being experienced by farmers in Athea, Glin, Shanagolden, Ballyhahill, Ardagh, Newcastle West, Templeglantine, Tournafulla, Mount Collins and Abbeyfeale.  The land in this area is very wet, cattle have been indoors for as long as two months, and farmers have been unable to sell those cattle because of the prices.  There are also difficulties in other areas of the county which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>The crisis forced farmers to graze 31 per cent of silage fields from which silage is not now available. Thirteen per cent of farmers were forced to use winter fodder prematurely.  All farmers stated that the quality of the fodder saved is poor.  There has been a fall-off of 10 per cent in milk yields, and 18 per cent of farmers were forced to destock as a result of the bad weather.  Thirty-nine per cent of those surveyed had not sourced winter feed.  The estimated drop in the income of farmers in the area for 1998 is 26 per cent.  The drastic situation needs urgent action and ministerial intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A multi-faceted approach is necessary to enable affected farmers to survive.  This must involve the Department of Agriculture and Food, the co-operatives, banks, the Revenue Commissioners and community services.  I fully endorse the following proposals which have been made by the Irish Farmers' Association: the immediate payment of headage to include a once-off increase; REPS payments to be made immediately without inspections; a reduction in the retention period for suckler cow and beef premia so that farmers who are forced to destock before the end of the period will not lose premia; the cost of feed and fertiliser to be reduced &mdash; the cost of nitrogen has increased by between £10 and £20 in recent weeks; improved credit terms from the co-operatives and dairies; banks to give special credit terms to farmers who are finding it difficult to make repayments &mdash; the Minister should open negotiation with the banks on this issue immediately; superlevy bills to be deferred <Col N="406" /> by dairies for at least 12 months &mdash; the Minister should raise this issue with the dairies; dairies to refund penalties made where work was not carried out under the dairy hygiene regulations.</P>
    <P>The £10 million which has been proposed for the farmers will be useless.  It will be worth roughly £400 to each affected farmer and will buy only 20 round bales of silage.  How does the Minister of State propose to distribute the £10 million? We have not seen any proposal yet as to how this will be distributed.</P>
    <P>The freefall in cattle prices this week is nothing short of frightening, but the freefall of the Government inaction is a disgrace.  Some animals are worth £250 less than a year ago, with some values falling by £170 per head since last June. The Minister's answer is to get 592 tonnes of meat into intervention over the next fortnight, which is equivalent to 1,800 cattle, when 40,000 cattle will be offered for sale in the same period. Even more frightening is the fact that some farmers put cattle through the mart ring yesterday and did not get a realistic bid.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Connaughton's statement, which he could not make in the Dáil yesterday, that the initial enthusiasm for the much sought after live cattle trade to Libya has now turned to deep seated anger as farmers have not been told by the Minister why there is a hold up, or if this market will reopen in the near future.</P>
    <P>What is the exact position with the Iranian market?  The Minister should intervene on the basis of the IFA survey and its proposals to alleviate the situation in County Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. N. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to reply to this motion and I thank Deputy Neville for raising such an important issue.  I fully accept that significant hardship will be created on many individual farms in the areas most adversely affected by weather conditions.  I do not need to labour the point on the weather situation this summer and the persistent rainfall.  In the peaty and heavy clay soil areas of certain counties, the capability of farmers to make adequate silage and hay was greatly reduced.  While the situation improved significantly in many areas in August, and while the two week dry spell in September was very important, fodder difficulties exist in a number of areas.  In addition, farmers in such areas have had great difficulty allowing animals to graze such lands and many animals have already been brought indoors, further exacerbating the winter fodder difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government identified the fodder crisis and the weather-related problems.  In early August I was invited by many Deputies to visit areas and see at first hand the difficulties that had arisen.  Deputy Neville's constituency was one of the first I visited.  I was in places such as Carrigkerry and Ardagh where I saw for myself the problems in that heavy soil.  I fully understand the situation.  I also visited north Kerry and since then I have been to many other areas to see the situation <Col N="407" /> at first hand.  The Deputy need have no fear about our understanding of the problem, although we did not bring about the heavy rainfall of 16 inches that created it.</P>

      <P>A number of areas of the country have been particularly affected.  These have already been documented in Teagasc reports.  In summary, they are as follows: Leitrim; Cavan-West; Roscommon-North (Keadue, Arigna); Mayo (Belmullet, Westport, Ballina, Swinford); along the rivers Shannon and Suck, including the Shannon callows; Clare, all areas, especially north and west Clare; Limerick, west and south-west; Longford-north; Donegal, all except east Donegal; Kerry, south and east of Killarney; Galway, wetland areas and Connemara; Sligo, especially west and south; Cork-West, Duhallow and Skibbereen/Bantry areas.  Deputy Neville will note that parts of County Limerick are included in this list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has responded by making £10 million available to deal with fodder difficulties being experienced by certain farmers.  The details of the new scheme are being finalised with a view to making payments as quickly as possible.  European Commission approval has already been sought.  In addition, it has also been decided to seek the approval of the European Commission to continue sheep headage top-up equivalent to £2.75 million.  The intention is that this money <Col N="408" /> would be made available for mountain ewes and suckler and small dairy herds in the worst affected areas, including some of Deputy Neville's area.  A major consideration is the need to devise payment arrangements that would get assistance quickly to farmers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's success in announcing this evening the carcase weight increase to 360 kilos and the decision to allow O4s into intervention. This is a major step forward.</P>

      <P>It has all been sorted out this evening.  In addition to the winter fodder scheme, the Minister has over recent weeks announced a series of measures to assist farmers with their cash flow this autumn.  These measures include speeding up direct payments to farmers &mdash; these are worth £1 billion annually and account for half of all income from farming; an increased advance in suckler cow and special beef premium payments from 60 to 80 per cent which will release an additional £45 million to farmers in November and December; more rapid payment of REPS <Col N="409" /> where such payments are falling due; payment of outstanding top-up of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October; arrangements for Teagasc to hold special free advisory clinics on fodder in the areas affected; promoting live exports, including progress on re-opening trade with Libya &mdash; I am glad to say that in excess of 100,000 live cattle have been exported this year and last year; agreement was reached in Brussels last Friday to substantially increase beef export refunds, the increase is equivalent to 5p per lb.  of beef, and follows previous export refund increases for beef, pigmeat &mdash; which was further increased this evening &mdash; and SMP; ensuring that appropriate transport facilities are available for live exports; and securing the Iranian market for our beef exports.</P>
      <P>I think this is an impressive list of actions and should help the cash flow of farmers, including those in County Limerick.</P>

      <P>My main reason for raising this matter is to seek information on current Government policy on this issue.  There is clearly a huge demand for the treatment of drug addicts in the Dublin area.  Unfortunately, this demand is not being adequately met.  We must develop our treatment and rehabilitation options as well as our after-care programmes.  Our treatment must not merely consist of prescribing methadone.  We now have a situation in the Eastern Health Board area where there is huge demand for treatment which does not currently seem to be available. There is a new protocol in place which has led to a substantial increase in the demand for methadone at clinics.  Addicts who have been attending GPs with large waiting lists are, apparently, now expected to attend local clinics.  A number of doctors were seeing huge numbers of addicts in their surgeries and this led to many complaints from local residents.  I am glad to see this situation has now been resolved and that we have a new protocol in place.  However, we must meet the needs of these patients in the best possible way.  I understand that only specially trained GPs can prescribe methadone to a maximum of 35 patients, all of whom will be registered on a central list and identified by photo ID cards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this item on the Adjournment in order to pose a number of questions.  I would like the Minister of State to outline the current situation regarding the use of local health clinics to provide such a service.  What arrangements have been made with the clinics in question to prepare for this situation and how many addicts do not have GPs available to them at present?  How many specially trained GPs are currently offering <Col N="410" /> methadone to patients, and is there still a shortage of GPs in certain areas?  What can we do about this and how can the situation concerning this shortage be dealt with?  What special arrangements have been made if local health clinics are to be used, given the range of issues which arises relating to the provision of treatment for drug addicts in such places?  Have the health and safety at work regulations of 1989 been adhered to and has a risk assessment been made?  Have safety statements been made for the staff involved?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be alarmist, but these clinics are also used for developmental checks on children. Is it feasible to have both groups being dealt with in the same rooms and have adequate arrangements been made?  There are risks of infection and it must be made absolutely sure that the necessary safety mechanisms have been put in place.  This issue must be tackled positively. Treatment must be provided, but I raise these questions in the interest of ensuring the treatment options are accepted by local communities and those working in local health board clinics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing her time.  The four Deputies in Dublin South-East are <i>ad idem</i> on this topic and believe it must be dealt with properly and sensitively. Deputy Fitzgerald raised important questions.  It is important Deputies in the area and the community are given full information by the Eastern Health Board.  It is only then that proper decisions can be made on these important matters.</P>
      <P>No one wants to be alarmist.  We acknowledge the need for proper methadone clinics, but when the information given is contradictory, the suspicions of the local community are raised.  In Ringsend and Irishtown, the community was told there would be a mobile unit fitted out for high dosage users and this was agreed to.  We were then told this was shelved.  Subsequently we were told it was back on the agenda but it would be for low dosage users.  We were then told it would be accommodated in the clinic.  What we do not know in both cases is whether the users will consume the methadone on the premises or whether they will receive scripts.  Many people are concerned about the latter because they believe a Trinity Court scenario will ensue with people loitering outside the building.  That is something everyone wants to avoid.  It would be in the best interests of the community and the Eastern Health Board if this matter were dealt with properly and openly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the review group on methadone treatment services recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that strict controls should be introduced on prescribing and dispensing methadone.  The Misuse of Drugs (Supervision of Prescription and Supply of Methadone) Regulations, 1998, were introduced by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy <Col N="411" /> Cowen, to give effect to the recommendations of the review group.</P>
      <P>The regulations came into effect in two phases. Under the first phase, which took effect from 16 July 1998, a pharmacist dispensing physeptone/methadone could only do so on foot of a prescription written by a registered medical practitioner on an official prescription form which was introduced on a temporary basis pending the introduction of a new form on 1 October. In addition, from 16 July 1998, pharmacists were required to return a copy of every prescription form for physeptone/methadone to a central point to allow my Department to monitor the prescribing of these controlled drugs.</P>
      <P>The first phase of the regulations also provided that, where a general practitioner proposed to prescribe physeptone/methadone to a patient for the first time, that practitioner would also have to notify details of that patient to the Eastern Health Board for inclusion on a central treatment list to be maintained by the board.  The purpose of this provision was to ensure that patients were not obtaining physeptone/methadone from more than one source.</P>
      <P>Phase two of the regulations came into force on 1 October and, since that date, a general practitioner cannot issue a prescription for methadone to a patient unless a valid treatment card exists in respect of him.  Only patients whose details have been entered on the central treatment list are issued with treatment cards.  In addition, a pharmacist can only dispense methadone to a patient in respect of whom the pharmacist holds a valid treatment card.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the review group, only general practitioners with appropriate training will be allowed to prescribe methadone for opiate misusers and, in addition, the numbers attending any individual general practitioner or pharmacist will be strictly controlled. This will ensure that the prospect of large numbers of patients congregating around individual general practitioners' and pharmacists' premises will be avoided.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, in whose area the vast majority of opiate misusers reside, has appointed liaison general practitioners and pharmacists to recruit general practitioners and pharmacists into the new scheme to ensure an equal spread in each local area where a service is required.  That was one of the questions asked by Deputy Fitzgerald.  As this recruitment effort proceeds, the board may be required, as an emergency measure, to open facilities in locations where previously no service was provided but where it is clear there are significant numbers of drug users in the immediate locality who are without a service.  In many instances, these patients may have been attending general practitioners and pharmacists in locations outside their own areas.  The board's overall aim will be to ensure that patients in need of treatment receive it in their own locality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> I am confident the new arrangements will result in a significant improvement in the services provided for drug misusers.  They will have the following beneficial effects: the numbers of patients attending individual doctors and pharmacists will now be controlled; only doctors who have received adequate training will be given contracts to prescribe; the possibility of methadone leaking on to the streets will be greatly diminished; and the information available about the prescribing and dispensing of methadone will be greatly improved.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister with responsibility for this area is not in the House to hear what I have to say.  With due respect to the Minister of State, he has no responsibility in this matter.</P>
      <P>In May this year, the House passed important and long overdue legislation, the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill.  It has the support of all parties in the House because it attempts to deal in a co-ordinated way with implementing halting sites and accommodation programmes for the travelling community while also laying down important legal markers in terms of unauthorised sites which are a blot on the landscape of this city and country.  It attempts to deal effectively with finding a home for 1,100 travelling families living on the side of the road.</P>
      <P>I discovered that, on 11 September, the Minister for State, Deputy Molloy, signed the commencement date for the legislation.  To date, the relevant local authorities whose statutory function is to implement this law, have yet to receive the necessary guidelines from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  That is a disgrace.  Politicians are attempting to sell this legislation to the community, arguing there is a need for accommodation while, at the same time, saying new legal methods are in place for dealing with unauthorised sites, and are taking difficult and courageous decisions in each case where there is a need for a halting site, while the Department is standing idly by and is not helping local authorities and politicians in the important task which lies ahead.  Why is it the case that a law passed in this House has not come into effect three or four months later and more than a month after its date of commencement?  Why is the law established by the House not in force in the community?  It is not good enough that we are being left to carry the can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My area of Tallaght has many unauthorised sites within a one mile radius.  They are there illegally as a result of the legislation being passed. The local authority does not want to address the issue because it has not received the guidelines from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  That is classic bureaucracy of the worst kind.  I want answers as to why this situation has been allowed to develop because if it <Col N="413" /> continues for much longer there will be riots in the streets.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal has made an order bringing into operation all sections of the Act other than sections 6, 19, 20 and 25.  However, in order to provide assistance to local authorities in implementing the provisions of the Act, the guidelines to which the Deputy refers are currently being finalised by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and are expected to issue to local authorities shortly. These draft guidelines are being prepared following consultation with local authorities, traveller organisations and the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group.  This process reflects the importance of consultation which is provided for in the new Act and ensures that the guidelines will contain comprehensive advice to housing authorities on their obligations under the Act.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will deal with matters such as the consultation process to be entered into with various interested parties, the preparation, adoption, implementation and review of accommodation programmes, powers of local authorities to control unauthorised temporary dwellings and issues of estate management.  The guidelines will also incorporate ministerial directions under a number of sections of the Act.  It is also intended that the guidelines on the implementation of the Act will be accompanied by other guidelines, drawn up under section 29, covering the design, provision and management of permanent residential caravan parks and the provision of emergency or temporary services and facilities, pending the provision of permanent accommodation.</P>
      <P>Following the issuing of the guidelines, the Department of the Environment and Local Government in association with the housing unit of the Institute of Public Administration will be arranging a series of seminars for local authority housing officers to discuss with them the requirements of the Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already stated, most sections of the Act have now been commenced.  Accordingly the legislative basis is now in place for housing authorities to make a planned and comprehensive response to the accommodation needs of travellers. Many local authorities have already begun the process of implementing the Act.  Local authorities have, of course, considerable experience <Col N="414" /> in providing accommodation for travellers and I expect that authorities will, in advance of accommodation programmes being put in place, continue to avail of existing schemes to meet the current demands.</P>
    <P>One of the issues widely raised is the problem encountered by local authorities in trying to deal with unauthorised encampments of temporary dwellings.  The position is that the Act restates the existing powers available and used by local authorities in this regard and provides for a greater degree of flexibility in their use.  Furthermore, additional powers are contained in the Act to deal with unauthorised temporary dwellings within one mile of existing accommodation, regardless of whether alternative accommodation is available.  I expect that, in accordance with the Act, as accommodation programmes are implemented the number of such unauthorised encampments will decrease.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new Act, accompanied by the guidelines to be issued shortly, will provide a new impetus and a more focused approach to meeting the accommodation needs of travellers in a spirit of greater understanding on the part of local authorities, travellers and the public.</P>

      <P>Now that Crampton Buildings are due to be sold on 5 November, many of the 54 tenants who live in this beautiful courtyard in the heart of Temple Bar face an uncertain future; indeed, many could face the prospect of eviction. Unfortunately, these people are not alone in their predicament because throughout the city speculators, landlords and property owners are having a field day at the expense of powerless tenants. The more vibrant our economy, the more threatened are the vulnerable in society.  With little notice, landlords can hike up rent to exorbitant levels or give tenants notice to vacate a premises. These people are left with no other option than to seek accommodation from Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, found it difficult to admit that there is a housing crisis.  He must be living in denial because when young married couples cannot afford to purchase houses, when ordinary people cannot afford to pay their rent, when the housing lists are growing longer by the day, then we are certainly faced with a housing crisis.  What is the Government doing about this crisis?  The Bacon report merely tinkers with the problem while fundamental changes are required.  We need a Government that cares.  The Minister may argue that the Government cares but I contend that it cares for the wrong people, namely, developers and property owners.  It cares so much that it reduced capital gains tax in the last budget.  The Government cares about the rights of those people but when asked about the duties of property owners it becomes less certain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; recently when the <Col N="415" /> Minister of State was asked about the capping of rents he replied that this would be very difficult because of the existence of constitutional impediments. If such impediments exist we should hold a referendum and, if necessary, amend Article 43 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The case of Crampton Buildings is symptomatic of a much deeper problem in society.  It is ironic that this little enclave is situated in Temple Bar, the symbol of the new vibrant Ireland &mdash; home of the Celtic tiger.  We were informed that Temple Bar would become a cultural centre but, unfortunately, it is now often associated with the loutish behaviour of stag parties.  We were also informed that it would retain a social mix. Crampton Buildings contains such a mix which comprises the young, the old, students, workers and the unemployed.  It is a thriving inner city community, the members of which wish to remain in their present accommodation.</P>
    <P>Temple Bar Properties must do everything possible to assist these tenants.  That company has already agreed to obtain a valuation of the property, which is a welcome development.  Ideally the tenants would like to establish a housing co-operative in order to buy out the property themselves. If that is the case they will need the assistance of Temple Bar Properties, Dublin Corporation and the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  They could also enter into negotiations with Dublin Corporation and the current owners to consider a shared ownership scheme. The final option would be that the corporation could purchase the building and the occupants would then become its tenants.</P>
    <P>At the last election, Fianna Fáil used the slogan &ldquo;People before politics&rdquo;.  These are ordinary, decent, genuine people who are facing eviction as we approach Christmas.  I ask the Minister to take that into account.  The tenants deserve our congratulations because they have so far shown tremendous courage, determination and organisational ability.  I congratulate my colleague, Councillor Kieran Cuffe, who has led the charge on this issue and who recommended that Crampton Buildings be upgraded to a list 1 building. These people deserve our congratulations and they have the support of the Green Party.</P>

      <P>The proposed sale of Crampton Buildings in Temple Bar and the consequences of such a sale for the tenants raises matters of property law which are quite complex. It is for this reason that I have come before the House to reply to the motion tabled by Deputy Gormley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will understand that I am somewhat constrained in the comments which I can offer on this matter in view of the fact that I am not privy to all of the circumstances surrounding the individual tenancy agreements in this case.  It is a matter of law that the rights of tenants in private rented accommodation are determined in <Col N="416" /> the first instance by reference to the terms of a lease or to any other tenancy agreement in existence. There is also the statutory code governing the landlord and tenant relationship which is reflected in the body of legislation that lies within my area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that concerns have been expressed about the situation of tenants in the private rented sector for whom security of tenure is a major issue.  It was in an attempt to give a measure of security to long-term tenants in particular that the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1980 gave residential tenancies of 20 years standing a right of renewal of tenancy for up to 35 years. This entitlement is sometimes referred to as the long occupation equity.  Where a new tenancy is availed of under these provisions there is a procedure, in the absence of agreement, whereby the rent can be determined by a court and the court has to set a rent which in its view would represent an open market rent for the property in question.</P>
    <P>Over the years doubts had been expressed about the real efficacy of this provision in achieving the intended result.  In consequence, it was thought appropriate that this matter should be addressed by a working group on security of tenure which was established under the aegis of the Department in the mid-1990s and which reported in 1996.  I understand the recommendations of that group have been the subject of consideration in the Department, but the examination has not progressed to a point where it is possible to indicate whether the recommendations will be incorporated in legislative form.</P>
    <P>It is a matter beyond dispute that issues surrounding the landlord and tenant relationship are extremely complex.  A particular problem here is that there is a need to balance the rights of landlords and tenants in a way that is compatible with constitutional requirements.  Thus, while I am conscious of, and sympathetic to, the difficulties facing vulnerable tenants, especially those who are elderly and who have held their tenancies for a long period of time, I cannot guarantee that it will be possible to resolve, through legislative action, the inherent difficulties which attach to this area of the law.  I note in that respect that Deputy Gormley referred to the constitutional difficulty and suggested constitutional change, if proved to be the way forward.</P>
    <P>I understand that some of the tenants in the case to which the Deputy alluded may be covered by the provisions of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, which is legislation for which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has responsibility.  That Act confers a right to retain, as a tenant, possession of a formerly controlled dwelling for the lifetime of the person who was the tenant at the commencement of the Act, or the lifetime of their spouse.  Where a member or successive members of the tenant's family succeed to the tenancy within 20 years of the commencement of the Act &mdash; 26 July 1996 &mdash; the right to retain possession continues until 25 July 2002, when it expires sub <Col N="417" /> ject to lasting a minimum period of five years. The terms of the tenancy for the period of the entitlement to retain possession may be fixed by the rent tribunal in the absence of agreement between the landlord and tenant.  I have been informed that the question of the legislative provisions that may be appropriate to protect tenants of formerly controlled dwellings will be considered within the context of the applicable court judgments in advance of the expiry of the existing provisions.</P>
    <P>There is an implication in the Deputy's comments that the State should intervene in the private rental market to regulate the rents landlords may ask for their property.  In response to that I can say no more than the history of past legislation which attempted to impose rent restrictions does not suggest this is a viable proposition.</P>

We must also be aware that, for constitutional reasons, any changes which might be introduced in future would normally not affect the rights of parties under existing leases or other tenancy agreements as opposed to future leases or tenancy agreements.</P>

      <P>The forum has now completed its work.  It presented its recommendations to me on 2 September. A copy of the forum's recommendations has also been laid before the Dáil.

      <P>Contacts between the management of semi-State bodies and the Government take the form of ongoing interaction involving the appropriate parent Departments and Ministers. In addition, I am kept informed of key developments and issues affecting the operations of such bodies.  This process works well and is complemented by meetings between myself and the chief executives of semi-State organisations as the need arises.</P>
      <P>As I have stated in the House previously, a key Government priority in relation to the semi-State sector has been to maximise the conditions to enable such companies to be competitive and cost-effective in the provision of vital public services to the benefit of the consumer.  Our aim is to have growing and healthy companies, serving the public well and giving high quality employment at home and abroad and I am satisfied with progress in this regard.</P>

      <P>The circumstances of the last three months, especially the difficulties surrounding Drumcree and the tragedy of Omagh, as well as other functions such as the peace Mass on 17 July in the Pro-Cathedral, have afforded me the opportunity of frequent meetings with a number of church leaders.  I also met in May with Archbishop Empey and with Fr. Paul Byrne, OMI, of the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants, on 9 July.</P>
      <P>The main pre-occupation of all of us has been to prevent further human tragedy by ensuring that the British-Irish Agreement, endorsed by the people, is proceeded with.  My office continues to avail of the good services of individual clergy and community leaders to further the cause of peace, stability and reconciliation.  I have always believed, and have found, that they have an important role to play; one that we neglect at our peril.  That was demonstrated during the period leading up to the Downing Street Declaration and the two ceasefires, and also in the more recent past.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Information Society Commission's first report was published in February this year and I understand that copies were circulated to every Member of the House.  The report sets out the main areas of the commission's work programme covering awareness, infrastructure, learning, enterprise, legal issues, Government services and social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission has set up six advisory groups to help take its work forward in each of these areas.  As the term suggests, the role of these groups is to advise the commission.  However, a significant amount of the commission's work is <Col N="421" /> also being done directly at advisory group level, under the overall guidance of the commission.  I will take a few moments to outline the main issues being examined, and some of the specific initiatives which the commission has undertaken recently.</P>
    <P>Possibly the most important work of the commission is in raising awareness of the information society and its benefits.  Initiatives here include the holding in June of a conference on the importance of the information society for social inclusion.  Also in June, the commission co-hosted a symposium on electronic commerce at which Ira Magaziner, special advisor to the US President, was the keynote speaker.</P>
    <P>The commission is the primary sponsor of a new television series, TechTV, which is currently being screened by Network 2 every Tuesday evening at 8 p.m. The commission is also launching an awareness campaign for business, in conjunction with IBEC, which will run over the next few months.  In addition, it is encouraging businesses to adopt its logo as a demonstration that they are embracing the information society.</P>
    <P>On infrastructure, the commission is monitoring developments closely in the run up to full liberalisation of the telecommunications market.  It is considering all of the key issues in this area, including the question of ensuring full international connectivity at competitive prices.  It is one of a number of bodies whose views are helping to shape strategic policy decisions in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to learning, the commission is focusing on strategies to encourage the concept of lifelong learning in all walks of life within the information society.  In this context, it has already highlighted the need for additional measures outside the formal education process.</P>
    <P>In the area of enterprise, the commission is considering employment issues arising under the information society and is examining ways of monitoring and assessing the changes arising from the increasing trend towards new forms of work organisation, including flexible working time, increased teleworking and homeworking.</P>
    <P>On legal issues, the commission is examining a wide range of subjects where legislation is likely to require amendment or where new legislation may be needed, arising from its work under the other headings.  For example, in order to facilitate electronic commerce, appropriate legislation is needed under a number of headings, such as facilitating security and confidentiality of transactions, and ensuring protection of data and copyright.</P>
    <P>Under Government services and social inclusion, the commission monitors best international practice in delivery of public services electronically and provides advice on how best to ensure that developments in this area address the needs of groups such as the elderly and persons with disabilities.  As I have already mentioned, the commission arranged a conference in June on the importance of the information society for social inclusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="422" /> The commission will shortly publish the results of national surveys which it has commissioned on attitudes towards and use of information and communication technologies among both the general population and the business community.  This will enable the commission to focus its efforts in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission will present its next annual report early in 1999.</P>

      <P>The Insurance Link Scheme is a database compiled from information supplied by the commercial insurance companies and other subscribers to the scheme.  Many insurance companies, local authorities and some semi-State bodies are currently subscribing to the scheme, the aim of which is to reduce the number of fraudulent claims by allowing members to share information in relation to previous claims made.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor's Office is considering joining the scheme and has consulted with Departments to ascertain their views on the matter. Arising from this process a number of legal issues need to be considered.  When this consideration is complete a decision will be made regarding membership of the scheme.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the briefings I gave the House on the work of the centre on 11 March, 6 May and 23 June last, the National Centre for Partnership has been actively engaged in pursuing its work programme in both the private and public sectors and this has continued over the last six months.  In the private sector, the centre has initiated a series of regional seminars on the topic of partnership at enterprise level.  The first was held in UCD in early June and further seminars are scheduled for Cork and Galway this month.  The seminar is targeted at senior management, union officials and other parties with interest in the topic.  Both IBEC and ICTU are active participants in the seminars and the feedback from the initial seminar has been positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The joint IBEC/ICTU project &mdash; Partnership in Action at Enterprise Level (PACT) &mdash; under the EU ADAPT initiative has commenced. Under the project, eight teams have been established on a regional basis made up of management and employee representatives from selected companies, an IBEC executive and a trade union official.  The teams are assessing and surveying <Col N="423" /> their own needs and the needs of the companies involved in order to develop enterprise partnership. The project will run to the end of 1999, with the objective that the teams will act as catalysts and facilitators for other enterprises in their region.  The centre is liaising with the co-ordinators of the project in order to learn from the experience and disseminate the information.</P>
    <P>The centre has established a computer database containing details on either multi-stranded or single partnership issues existing in enterprises with the intention of monitoring existing developments and expanding as more details emerge <i>via</i> surveys, direct contact and other sources of information available to the centre.  The identification of a number of enterprises on a cross-sectoral basis where partnership topics are being successfully practised will be made easier with access to this database.  It is intended that suitable enterprises will be documented and video taped with a view to disseminating their experiences and shortening the learning curve of other enterprises on the partnership path.</P>
    <P>With regard to the public sector, a series of regional seminars have been arranged for the Civil Service, local government and health sectors. These seminars commence in Sligo on 20 October and will run in Galway, Cork and Dublin, finishing on 18 November.  The Irish Productivity Centre is assisting in the organisation and delivery of the seminars.  The audience will consist of management, union and staff representatives with the objective of promoting partnership locally and to create a platform for updating representatives on developments in the local government and health sectors in particular.  In addition, a joint National Centre for Partnership/Irish Management Institute seminar on the implications of partnership for management development in the public service was held on 22 September and was well received.</P>
    <P>Many Civil Service Departments and offices now have their partnership committees in place and the centre is assisting in putting partnership structures in place in the wider public service.  A group has been established, chaired by my Department, consisting of representatives of Departments with bodies under their aegis, the Local Government Management Services Board, the Health Service Employers Agency and the National Centre for Partnership.  Progress is being made towards the wide establishment of partnership structures, with facilitation and assistance from the centre.  The centre is finalising training materials for public sector partnership and these will be disseminated as widely as possible, as soon as possible.  Also, the centre will produce the first of its partnership bulletins this month.  This will contain a range of information on partnership topics as well as working experiences of various forms of partnership.  It is envisaged that five bulletins will be produced between now and March, 2000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> On a general note, as a result of a widening interest, not just in Ireland, of enterprise level partnerships, the centre has had discussions with French and Danish groups to exchange experiences. Further international contacts are being pursued by the joint directors.</P>

      <P>As I said last week, I have been meeting and liaising intensively with the parties and others, including Prime Minister, Tony Blair, First Minister designate, David Trimble and Deputy First Minister designate, Séamus Mallon, SDLP leader, John Hume, Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams and Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam.  I had a further, very useful, meeting last Friday with a Sinn Féin delegation led by Martin McGuinness.  We discussed the current situation and how we can best achieve progress, and I was encouraged by the depth of engagement in the discussions between Sinn Féin and the Independent Commission.</P>
      <P>We are all conscious of the difficulty we face on the issue of decommissioning.  What we need to do is to achieve a situation where there are common understandings and common ground. There must be confidence on all sides and we are working on that.  The people voted in overwhelming numbers for the British-Irish Agreement, and we all have a duty as public representatives to deliver what the people voted for.  We must not allow the situation to fall behind.  For our part, the Government will continue to do everything we can to make progress in implementing the Agreement in all its aspects.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The next meeting of EU Heads of State is in Portschach in Austria on 24-25 October for an informal meeting of Heads of State or Government and the President of the Commission.  Given <Col N="425" /> that the meeting is informal in its nature, no formal decisions will be taken and no written conclusions will be issued.  The agenda for this meeting is not yet finalised.  However, it is likely to focus on subsidiarity and democratic legitimacy; institutional issues; the role and proposed reform of the General Affairs Council; and appointment of a high representative for the common foreign and security policy &mdash; CFSP.</P>
    <P>Ireland's fundamental concern is that every member state should retain the right to nominate a full member of the Commission, a principle which was respected at Amsterdam but which will undoubtedly come up again.  In addition, we will be attentive to the timing and possible constitutional implications of further institutional reform.  I also believe that it is imperative in any GAC reform that the link between the Council of Ministers and the European Council is fully maintained, thus safeguarding Ireland's interests as a smaller member state.</P>

      <P>As we near the close of the Government's 1798 commemoration programme I am delighted, as chairperson of the commemoration committee to take this opportunity to outline the events organised or assisted, as part of that programme by my committee.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy's knows it was my committee's intention to develop a broad ranging, comprehensive and inclusive programme which commemorated the ideals of the United Irishmen and the &lsquo;Fellowship of Freedom&rsquo; that inspired them in 1798.  With this in mind it was felt that the commemoration programme should focus primary attention on the principles of democracy and pluralism which the United Irishmen advocated. Projects such as the International Conference &lsquo;1798 A Bicentenary Perspective&rsquo;, the National Museum and National Library's interactive exhibition at Collins Barracks, the Irish and British Government's 1798 commemoration scholarship and the RTE documentary series &lsquo;Rebellion&rsquo; are examples of projects funded which I think duly reflected my committee's objectives.</P>
      <P>My committee was also happy to fund projects such as the Dublin-Belfast Choral Festival, the publication of Wolfe Tone's diaries and the Drennan papers, the Humbert and Merriman Schools and the restoration of the William Lawless tomb in Paris.  Plans to circulate an education pack to schools are under way.  The Film Institute of Ireland's film festival I know was a great success and the Glencree Peace Centre is continuing to develop its programme &lsquo;From Revolution to Reconciliation&rsquo;.  The development of the Croppies Acre site at Collins Barracks as a memorial garden is under way and will be opened by the Taoiseach on 22 November.</P>
      <P>I believe we can all agree that the 1798 centre at Enniscorthy, which the Taoiseach opened earlier this year is a shining example of what can be done when state and local bodies work together with a single goal in mind.  The centre and its exciting interactive 1798 exhibition I know will continue to attract a large number of visitors for a long time to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many ceremonies have taken place over the last ten months to mark the rebellion.  One such ceremony attended by the Taoiseach and involving the French military and our own Defence Forces <Col N="428" /> took place in Ballina on the 22 of August to acknowledge France's involvement in 1798.  I am happy to say that throughout the commemoration period funding has been made available at local level to many projects throughout the country. Counties Armagh, Antrim, Cavan, Carlow, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Down, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois and Leitrim, Longford, Mayo, Meath, Monaghan, Sligo, Tipperary, Wicklow and Wexford all benefited from funding.  Unfortunately given the limited budget available it was not possible to fund all of the many worthy projects under way throughout the country and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to all of the local committees who have worked tirelessly to make their commemoration initiatives a success.  I would also like this opportunity to thank my committee for all their work in developing this broad ranging and inclusive 1798 programme of commemoration.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are free, at present, to recruit over 100 staff to bring their numbers up to the level approved by the Government.  Since 1996 the numbers employed in all Government Departments and Offices has been regulated by guidelines approved by successive Governments which set ceilings on the numbers employed in the Civil Service as a whole and in individual Departments and Offices.  The current agreed staffing target for the Revenue Commissioners is 6,044.  It is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners in common with the management of each Government Department or Office, to deploy staff within these guidelines in accordance with their own priorities.  Modifications to the staffing target for individual Departments or Offices may be considered from time to time where it can be demonstrated that essential and urgent tasks cannot otherwise be completed and where the Department or Office have exhausted the possibility of meeting these needs by redeployment of existing resources or modification of work practices.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 13,505 on-licences and 698 off-licences were issued by Customs and Excise during the year ending on 30 September 1998.  The numbers of non-renewed licences for the same period was 876 on and 22 off licences.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The economic and financial difficulties in Asia over the last year or so and more recently in Russia have created a climate of uncertainty and instability in the global financial markets.  Growth prospects, particularly for the developing world have weakened significantly.  There have been large falls in world stock markets and volatility in the dollar exchange rate.  The International Monetary Fund and other international forecasting agencies have against this background revised downwards their projections for world growth next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small and highly open economy Ireland cannot expect to be immune from slower world growth.  This will undoubtedly have a negative impact on our export growth and on foreign investment into this country which has been the main engine of our growth performance over the 1990s.  However, among the industrial countries of North America and Europe &mdash; to which about <Col N="431" /> three quarters of our exports go &mdash; the effects of the crisis on economic activity have so far been relatively small.  While some deceleration in growth is in prospect the consensus view presently is that economic growth in the US and the EU is likely to remain reasonably robust.  This should help minimise any negative impact of the global economic situation on Ireland's economic performance.</P>
    <P>The EU, in the context of the new EMU environment, remains firmly committed to its key role in helping to support international financial stability. I intend to play a full part with my ECOFIN and EURO 11 colleagues to this end in the enhanced co-ordination of EU economic policy which accompanies the establishment of the euro. Indeed the creation of EMU should help to support economic stability at a global level reflecting strict internal policies within the euro zone relating to the achievement of price stability and the conduct of national budgetary policies.  In the run-up to the 1999 budget I will be giving careful consideration to the broader international economic climate and its implications for the Irish economy.  The less favourable international outlook for 1999 does not in any way weaken the need for a prudent stance in the 1999 budget.  In fact it strengthens it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 62 and 104 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government decided in July last to dispose of the State's shareholding in ICC Bank plc and I am currently fully engaged in giving effect to this decision.  I have established a partnership group, comprising representatives of my Department and the board, management and staff of the bank, to assist in the management of the disposal.  I have also established a group representative of my Department and the board of the bank to deal with issues where the board has specific legal responsibilities. Within ICC Bank, a number of working groups have been set up to examine, and prepare for the partnership group, various matters relevant to the <Col N="432" /> disposal.  These groups are now meeting and are making good progress on the various issues coming before them.  I have also advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities for consultants to advise me in relation to the disposal and I expect to appoint my advisers shortly.</P>
    <P>In relation to ACC and TSB Banks, the boards and managements of both banks recently indicated their interest in exploring the option of a merger of banks and a flotation of the merged entity, an option which the staff unions in both banks support.  The banks have now entered into formal discussions on the matter.  I welcome this development and I will give positive and careful consideration to the outcome of these discussions.</P>

      <Quest>the reason only three cases brought to court by the Revenue Commissioners in 1997 resulted in successful convictions; the policy of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to prosecutions; and his views on whether the investigation branch of the Revenue has sufficient recourse to properly carry out its functions.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are encouraged by the record of convictions in respect of the cases brought to court so far. Monetary penalties were imposed in a number of cases, a prison sentence was imposed in one case and a suspended prison sentence in a further two cases.  Several other cases will be coming before the courts in the near future.  At present there are a total of 23 cases at various stages of investigation/prosecution.  Some of these have been investigated by the Garda.</P>
      <P>Prior to the introduction of the prosecution programme, the main drive against tax evasion was through the Revenue audit and investigation programmes.  These programmes have proven to be effective in collecting tax and interest and in penalising tax fraud and tax evasion.  The tougher stance now being taken against the most serious tax offenders/offences through the prosecution programme, as outlined in the Revenue Statement of Strategy 1997-1999, means that those convicted &mdash; in addition to paying tax interest and penalties due &mdash; can also be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both.  Nine officers are at present engaged in investigating prosecution cases.  Revenue keeps the deployment of resources across the full spectrum of their operations under ongoing review.  Subject to availability, the resources needed to ensure the success of the prosecution programme will be adjusted as required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Charlie McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the level of random audits up to 1998 was comparatively low because the yield from such audits was substantially lower than from targeted audits. Revenue's experience indicates that approximately two-thirds of random audits result in no additional tax liability being discovered, and in those cases where tax is recovered the amounts tend to be small.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are aware of the deterrent effect of a random audit programme and the need to demonstrate to every taxpayer that there is a real risk of audit selection.  In recognition of this, the Commissioners are increasing the number of random audits.  The 1998 figure is expected to be twice the figure for 1997, and it is expected that the figure for 1999 will be three times the 1997 figure.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the resource accounting and budgeting developments in Britain.  The UK model and timescale is appropriate to their circumstances; our approach reflects the needs and priorities of Irish government accounting.  The enhancement of accounting techniques in Government Departments has been under continuous review for several years.  A joint working group comprising representatives of the Department of Finance and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1994 recommended the incorporation of substantial accruals-based information in the Appropriation Accounts.  These recommendations <Col N="434" /> were endorsed by the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann and implemented in the Appropriation Accounts over the three year reporting period 1994 to 1996.</P>
      <P>On the basis of recommendations contained in <i>Delivering Better Government</i>, a financial management working group, comprising both private sector and public service representatives, was established under the chairmanship of the Secretary General of my Department.  A report addressing the structure of management and financial reporting, multi-annual budgeting and other Government accounting issues was presented to the implementation group on the SMI in June for submission to the Government in the near future.  The Government's consideration of the financial management working group report will also encompass the pilot project modelled on resource accounting undertaken in the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>

An information leaflet on the euro was delivered to every household in the country, involving a drop of about 1.3 million leaflets, and over 80,000 posters, showing the changeover timetable and pictures of the euro notes and coins, were distributed to schools, libraries and public offices.</P>
    <P>The public information campaign forms part of the national information programme.  The other elements of the programme are the Forfás EMU Business Awareness Campaign and a programme of information activities on the euro operated by non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Forfás runs the EMU Business Awareness Campaign.  To date, the campaign has distributed over 41,000 copies of its detailed information pack to the business sector, over 92,000 copies of a planning leaflet targeted at SMEs and 12,000 copies of a comprehensive guide on information technology.  It has used company awareness surveys to help focus its message, which it also conveys by means of radio and press advertising and regional seminars.  The campaign also publishes a quarterly newsletter <i>Eurochange</i> which has a circulation of around 20,000.  In addition, it maintains a campaign website which includes all the documents in its information pack.</P>
    <P>As regards non-governmental organisations, a total of 26 NGO bodies have been approved for EU funding totalling £200,000 in respect of planned information activities this year on the euro.  These bodies include organisations representing consumers, community, elderly and women's groups, trade unions and trade and professional associations.  The ECBI secretariat is administering, on behalf of the European Commission, the EU funding in respect of these projects.</P>
    <P>The board has a particular concern that groups with special needs should be catered for.  Towards this end, the ECBI has established a consultative panel composed of the main organisations representing groups with special needs, such as older people, people with disabilities, those with literacy problems and travellers.  The purpose of the panel is to inform the ECBI about the special information needs of these groups, to advise the ECBI on how best to address these needs and to help channel information to these groups and those they represent.  The secretariat is working on information initiatives for these groups: for example, a spoken-word version of the information leaflet for households has been produced in conjunction with the National Council for the Blind.</P>
    <P>Following the information campaign in June, the ECBI commissioned a national survey to monitor the level of knowledge of the changeover to the euro.  The survey results have helped to tailor the ECBI's information campaign for the <Col N="436" /> rest of the year.  A second phase of the information campaign is now under way and will include advertising in the print media in November. A further campaign will run in January 1999.</P>
    <P>The ECBI has also commissioned an information video on the euro which will be launched in November and will be widely circulated.  The ECBI is also part-sponsoring a series of six television programmes, <i>Living with the euro,</i> which will commence screening on RTE later in October.  The programmes will feature interviews and discussions about a wide variety of issues involving the euro.  It is also hoped to further promote the euro on both radio and television over the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition, I launched the ECBI website &mdash; www.  irlgov.  ie/ecbi-euro &mdash; in September. Included on the website are pictures of the euro notes and coins, the timetable for the introduction of the euro, the second edition of the national changeover plan and the recently enacted Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998.  There is also a section for schools.  The ECBI also has a page in the public information network on the Aertel service on RTE.  The page may be accessed on RTE 1, page 678.  Plans are under way for information briefings for nationally-representative groups which in turn will then use their networks to further disseminate information on the euro.</P>
    <P>A high priority is attached to ensuring that civil and public servants are familiar with the euro. Towards this end, the ECBI has already run briefing sessions for trainers in the Civil Service and is now running similar sessions for trainers in the public service, on foot of which they in turn will brief the staff of their own organisations.</P>
    <P>The ECBI is assisting the Department of Education and Science in preparing material for schools on the euro.  An information leaflet on the euro and its implications for their work has been prepared and will be issued shortly to schools.  This will be followed early in 1999 by guidelines detailing the curricular areas where teaching on the euro might usefully be introduced into the classroom.</P>
    <P>Finally, forthcoming publications include a third edition of Ireland's &ldquo;National Changeover Plan&rdquo; (due to be published in November) and an update of a detailed leaflet on EMU.  A frequently-asked questions and answers leaflet is also being prepared.  A further phase of the publicity campaign will of course be run in January to help familiarise the public with the conversion rate between the euro and the Irish pound, which will be fixed on 1 January 1999, and to help establish a scale of values in euro.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has already indicated that the Government is accepting the broad thrust of the report of the Commission on Nursing and that he wishes to talk to the nursing unions about a partnership approach to its implementation.</P>
      <P>As far as the specific pay issues referred to in the report are concerned, the Government's position is that these can be dealt with in a way that is consistent with the direction set down in the Taoiseach's address to the social partners last July.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the commission's report, the nursing unions decided to refer one of the three pay issues involved to the Labour Court and to refer the other two issues to the Labour Relations Commission.  Subsequently, on 25 September 1998, the Government announced that if health services management were invited to attend the Labour Court or the Labour Relations Commission, they would accept the invitation.</P>
      <P>I understand that such invitations have recently been received by the Health Service Employers' Agency and that health services management will be attending the Labour Court hearing and the Labour Relations Commission conciliation conference.</P>
      <P>I must emphasise, however, that management will be continuing to reiterate the Government's position that these issues can be dealt with in the context of the Taoiseach's initiative but only in that context.  The Government remains of the view that nurses' pay cannot be divorced from public service pay policy generally and that to attempt to deal with it in any other context would run the substantial risk of leading towards a destabilising return of leapfrogging special increases to restore traditional relativities.</P>

Costs are monitored on an ongoing basis by both of the Departments providing the service and I am satisfied that the current level of contribution <Col N="438" /> is adequate.  The Deputy will appreciate that the costs vary from year to year and are related to the level of security determined by the Garda authorities.  I have no proposals to alter the level of contribution in 1999.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was, in fact, requested from an interdepartmental working group chaired by my Department and made up of representatives of the Departments of Finance, the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General.  The mandate of the group was &ldquo;to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers&rdquo;.  It was also to consider what steps may be required to increase the public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.  I understand that a very significant amount of work has been undertaken on a wide range of issues related to banking and consumer matters and significant progress made.  A number of the issues considered have given rise to complex legal and administrative questions.</P>
      <P>The work of the group has taken longer than anticipated, because of the complexity and importance of the issues involved.  A rushed job would benefit no one.  I can say at this stage, however, that the group's deliberations are nearing finality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The capital allowances for the development of the whitefish fleet commenced on 4 September 1998.</P>
      <P>As regards the regional airports enterprise areas, the Deputy is probably aware that in May 1997, the Competition Directorate of the EU Commission sought detailed information on the new tax reliefs for the new enterprise areas provided in the Finance Act, 1997 including the regional airports enterprise areas.  This was on foot of an article in the Irish media publicising the new schemes.  The EU Commission then initiated a full investigation into the enterprise areas scheme.  Last December, the EU Commission decided to approve the tax reliefs for existing and some new enterprise areas in the context of State aids but the decision did not cover the regional airports enterprise areas.  EU officials have since informed my Department that the rates relief and double rent relief will not be approved by the EU Commission whenever a submission is made to them seeking EU approval for tax designation at any of the regional airport enterprise areas.  However, it is understood at present that there is no EU Commission objection to the provision of capital allowances.</P>
      <P>The approval of qualifying companies to operate in a regional airport enterprise area is through a certification process involving, <i>inter alia,</i> Forfás and the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance.  Therefore, when projects for the regional airports enterprise areas are approved by the Irish authorities and areas are then designated, they will be submitted to the EU Commission for approval in respect of the capital allowances.</P>
      <P>Neither my Department nor Forfás has yet received any applications for designation for specific projects at the proposed business and technology park at Cork Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to other tax incentive schemes, the reason for the delay arises from the need to secure EU approval on which discussions are ongoing.  These schemes are: the extension of tax reliefs for the Custom House Docks area in Dublin beyond 24 January 1999, the new urban <Col N="440" /> renewal scheme, the business incentives elements in the new rural renewal scheme, the tax incentives for investment in wind energy and other forms of renewable energy, and the special tax allowance for seafarers.</P>
    <P>As soon as EU approval is obtained the relevant commencement orders will be made.</P>

As soon as this work is completed, the matter will be brought to the Government for decision on what action needs to be taken.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, the issues involved are complex and it will be necessary to ensure that the measures adopted are enforceable, target the areas of abuse and do not adversely affect legitimate business.  Nonetheless, I expect to be able to bring proposals to Government in the near future.</P>

It is expected that this programme will be available for analysing audit results commencing in January 1999.  Third, a computer programme to assess potential tax risk and assist with audit case selection has been researched &mdash; the options available are under consideration.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63, 81, 93 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gormley asked about access to information on the environment and planning matters. In particular, the Deputy enquired as to plans for bringing these different arrangements into line with the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  I would like to advise that the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act apply to information where access or inspection is not available under another enactment or to information which is not otherwise publicly available.  Therefore, where information concerning environmental or planning matters is not already accessible, it may be sought under the Freedom of Information Act. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Freedom of Information Act currently applies to records held by An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The local authority sector will come within the scope of the Freedom of Information Act from 21 October next.</P>
      <P>As regards planning matters, the planning and development code already provides quite an open access regime to planning files and registers.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, is currently looking at the provisions regarding the availability of documents under the planning code as part of an overall review of planning legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to access to environmental information, my Department is having ongoing discussions with the Department of the Environment and Local Government on the future relationship between the existing statutory provisions on access to information on the environment and the Freedom of Information Act.  I also propose to list the access to information on the environment regulations in the third schedule to the Freedom of Information Act.  This will ensure that the exemption provisions in the regulations may not be used to refuse environmental information sought under the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sargent inquired about legislative measures required to give effect to the ratification by Ireland of the United Nations Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters.  I understand that the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> Minister for the Environment and Local Government is currently examining the measures required with a view to ratification of this convention and compliance by Ireland as soon as possible. Consideration of this matter will form part of the ongoing general discussions between our two Departments on the most appropriate legislative regime for access to environmental information.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the ESRI's comments in this regard which I believe appeared in the April 1998 Quarterly Economic Commentary.  I think that it is clear that social partnership has been a major factor in our economic success in recent years. It has provided moderate nominal pay increases combined with lower taxes and improved public services while also facilitating a major improvement in our public finances.  It has contributed to low inflation, improved competitiveness, very strong growth in output and employment and higher living standards.</P>
      <P>The 1999 budget will have as its primary objective the maintenance of low inflation and competitiveness. To this end, it will aim at providing the conditions for the successful continuation of social partnership and taxation will be an important element in this context.  However, tax policy, while supporting the continuation of social partnership through reductions in the burden of income tax, must also have regard to overall macroeconomic conditions and I will be considering this in preparing my budget together with the comments of economic bodies such as the ESRI.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that from 1996 there has been a gradual change in the revenue audit programme from quantitative to qualitative audits.  Under this approach more complex issues are tackled in the comprehensive audit programme.  In single taxhead cases more in-depth audits are conducted.  The result is that cases are taking longer to complete and while fewer were audited in 1996 and 1997 than in previous years, the average yield in terms of tax, interest and penalties collected per case has increased significantly.  For example the 1995 yield for comprehensive audits averaged £13,085 per case while the 1997 yield was £16,533 per case.  The average yield per case in 1998 for comprehensive audits so far is in the region of £20,000.  In the case of VAT, the 1995 yield was £3,603 per case while the 1997 yield was £5,001 per case.</P>
      <P>In late 1997, a problem was recognised to be emerging in the operation of RCT/PAYE in the construction industry.  Rather than allowing the problem to develop and become potentially insurmountable, Revenue decided to tackle the matter immediately by assigning a number of auditors to a special project to ensure appropriate tax compliance.  A total of 423 principal contractors were visited under the project in the period to December 1997.  As the focus of attention was confined to an examination of tax matters rather than an examination of the books and records of taxpayers, the visits did not fall be included in the counts of audits conducted.  The project has had an impact on the number of audits completed in 1997.</P>
      <P>There is a considerable variation in the amount of time normally required to complete various kinds of audit and investigations.  For example, the completion of a very large and complex case might require the application of two officers over a period of six months or more.  In contrast, a relatively simple audit of VAT returns might be competed in one day.  The overall number of audits and investigations in a year will naturally reflect the volume and nature of cases arising and the requirements to give special attention in certain years to certain kinds of cases.  Depending on the nature of these cases, the work carried out on them and overall compliance priorities, the number of audits undertaken will increase or decrease in comparison with previous years.  However, I can assure the Deputy that the Revenue Commissioners are determined to maintain the impact of their overall audit programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 67, 100, 130, 131 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland as a small and highly open economy &mdash; in which trade and flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) have made a major contribution to strong growth in output and employment over time &mdash; cannot expect to be unaffected by the deterioration in the global economic environment. Global growth prospects for 1999 have been downgraded significantly by the International Monetary Fund and other international forecasting agencies.  However, prospects for the US and EU &mdash; the destination for three-quarters of Ireland's exports and in the case of the US the major source of FDI into the Irish economy &mdash; appear relatively favourable.  The marked slow-down in emerging markets is likely to result in some deceleration in growth in the developed world.  However, the consensus view at present is that economic growth in the OECD area is likely to remain reasonably robust, but as I indicated in this year's budget economic growth in Ireland is expected to slow down in 1999 and later years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By common consent among the participants at the joint IMF-World Bank annual meeting last week, the EU has a crucial role to play in helping <Col N="446" /> to stabilise the international economy.  By sustaining relatively rapid economic growth into next year the EU economies will comprise a major growth pole in the international economy.  The launch of EMU will also make a significant contribution to the restoration of international financial stability through the maintenance of strict internal policies within the euro area focused on the achievement of price stability and on the conduct of budgetary policies in accordance with the terms of the stability and growth pact.  The increased emphasis on co-ordination of EU economic policies in the context of the establishment of EMU will help maximise the contribution of the EU economy to global economic recovery.</P>
    <P>In the period leading up to next December's budget I will be monitoring closely international economic and financial developments and assessing their impact on prospects for the Irish economy.  Budgetary strategy will be framed explicitly in the light of the unfolding international situation in order to ensure the medium-term sustainability of Ireland's economic performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>There is a broad range of evidence that consumer price inflation in Ireland as a small, highly open economy is primarily determined by international inflationary trends and also by exchange rate developments.  Excessive growth in domestic demand would be expected to impact mainly on the economy's balance of payments position through increased imports rather than in inflation.  Hence, the upturn in CPI inflation in the course of 1998 is largely attributable to the strength of the currencies of Ireland's main trading partners in the course of 1997 as measured by the effective (trade-weighted) exchange rate (EER).  This has been manifested directly in exchange rate sensitive traded goods but would also be expected to impact indirectly on non-traded goods and services prices in the economy reflecting the spillover from price increases in traded good inputs.  Recent movements in the EER should reduce upward pressure on prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent data does not prove that domestic demand is primarily responsible for recent price increases.  There is some evidence that prices of <Col N="447" /> services and some other home-produced items may be increasing faster than the average and this will have to be kept under review.  The annual increase in the Consumer Price Index in September last was 3 per cent.  My Department's latest inflation forecast published in Economic Review and Outlook (ERO) in July last was for an annual increase of 2.75 per cent for 1998 as a whole.  I will be updating this forecast for 1998 and setting out a projection for 1999 to 2001 in my budget on 2 December next.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we maintain the low inflation conditions achieved in recent years.  Wage moderation linked to reductions in taxes played a major role in achieving low inflation.  This has been a key feature in securing the competitiveness of the Irish economy, expanding employment and improving living standards generally.</P>
    <P>As previously indicated, the 1999 budget will have as its primary objective the maintenance of low inflation and competitiveness.  In current conditions of very strong growth in consumer spending and concern about inflationary pressures, it is essential that the budget does not add significantly to domestic demand.</P>

      <P>The Government's response to the Bacon report consisted of a three pronged approach, measures to increase the potential supply of housing, measures to dampen excessive investor demand and measures to improve the position of prospective first-time buyers.  The tax measures introduced are, in many cases, lagged in their effect and many of the issues relating to the supply of housing are of an infrastructural nature and may, in some cases, take years to come on stream.</P>
      <P>According to the Irish Permanent Index of House Prices produced in conjunction with the ESRI, the rate of growth in house prices has slowed down since June 1998.  Anecdotal evidence would also suggest that new housing estates, especially in suburban areas, traditionally seen as the preserve of first-time buyers, are over-whelmingly being sold to owner occupiers in recent months.  These properties had been the subject of high investor demand prior to the Finance (No. 2) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Issues relating to housing policy are complex and the required policy tools are not found solely in the taxation area.  Finally it should be noted that it will take some time to comprehensively assess the impact of the recent Government response. <Col N="448" /></P>

      <P>I do not propose to introduce any special tax allowances in respect of costs incurred by a business in connection with the changeover.  This is because such costs will generally be allowable in any event under existing tax legislation, whether the costs are of a current or capital nature.  Current costs, which are wholly and exclusively laid out for the purposes of a trade or profession, are fully deductible in the year in which they are incurred. In the case of the changeover to the euro, I expect current costs will account for most of the costs, and these can, in the normal manner, be offset against profits in calculating taxable profit.</P>
      <P>Some of the costs of the changeover may result in identifiable future benefits.  In so far as these can be capitalised i.e. in respect of expenditure incurred on improving or enhancing a capital asset, this will be regarded for tax purposes as capital expenditure and will generally qualify for capital allowances.  The standard capital allowances for plant and equipment are 15 per cent per annum for 6 years and 10 per cent in year 7.  I wish to inform the Deputy that all EU member states have agreed that no special concessions should be given for costs incurred by businesses for the changeover to the euro from which business will benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that our rapidly growing economy requires significant investment in infrastructure to prevent bottlenecks which could hinder competitiveness. It was for this reason that I provided significant increases in capital spending in my first budget.  In this regard, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the increase of 23 per cent in the Exchequer funding under the Public Capital Programme in 1998.  The 1997 budget increase was 9 per cent.  I can assure the House that in preparing my upcoming budget, I will give full consideration to the economy's investment needs having due regard to the capacity constraints in the building and construction sector.</P>
      <P>However, the case for reducing the national debt is compelling.  As the Deputy is aware, the national debt stood at over £30 billion at the end of 1997.  A reduction in this will lead to a reduction in debt servicing costs which will release resources for more productive purposes in future years, including improvement in our public services, continued tax reform and infrastructural development.  Running a surplus now is a continuation of the prudent fiscal policies which have been a key element of our recent economic success. During this exceptional period of growth it would be inappropriate for Government to spend all the additional resources.  We must prepare ourselves to cope with a number of significant challenges.  We are facing slower growth rates. EU transfers will reduce, which will increase the burden on the public finances.</P>
      <P>Looking further ahead we must also prepare the public finances to cope with much slower levels of growth in the next century as the current favourable demographic trends unwind and the number of elderly citizens increases.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would point out that the stability and growth pact commits the Government to a budget which is close to balance or in surplus during economic conditions such as we are experiencing at present.  As the Irish economy is now growing at exceptional rates, significant budget surpluses should be achieved in order to meet the objectives of the pact.</P>

    <P>The CSO data indicates that average weekly earnings of industrial workers increased by 3.6 per cent in the year to December 1997.  The increase in the average hourly earnings was 3.2 per cent over the same period.</P>
    <P>Average weekly earnings in the banking, insurance and building societies sector increased by 3.4 per cent in the year to December 1997.</P>
    <P>Construction industry wages have been increasing at a much faster rate than those in other sectors. The increase of 19.2 per cent reported by the CSO for the year to December 1997 includes both an increase in the hourly rate of 14.4 per cent and an increase in hours worked of 4.3 per cent.  The increase in hours worked can lead to increased overtime payments with a resultant impact on hourly rates.  An increase in the rates of pay was agreed between the Construction Industry Federation and the unions, including special pay increases for electricians and apprentice electricians.  Some of these were due earlier in the year, but were not implemented until the last quarter.  Provisional figures for earnings in the construction industry for March 1998 show a slow down in wages growth with average weekly earnings for all grades increasing by 9.2 per cent year on year.  This reflects an increase of 12.9 per cent in the hourly rate and a decrease of 3 per cent in the hours worked.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> In the light of the above, I am satisfied that the terms of Partnership 2000 are holding in the private sector in general.  Some pressures are emerging in certain sectors, possibly reflecting sectoral labour shortages in some instances. Government policy is directed to ensuring that skilled labour supply is maintained and thus that sectoral strains do not become serious and do not spill over into the economy generally.</P>

      <P>Stamp duty rates for residential property were reduced significantly by the Government as part of the package of taxation measures in the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1998 arising out of the Bacon report on house prices.  This reduction in stamp duty rates has been of benefit to all house purchasers, including first-time buyers.</P>
      <P>The Bacon report considered that reductions in stamp duty on all residential property would lead to additional turnover in the second hand house market thus increasing the range of housing available to first-time buyers.  Reducing stamp duty on residential property in this way has made the second hand house market more accessible for first-time purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the introduction of a specific exemption or relief for first-time buyers was considered. However, given the significant estimated <Col N="453" /> costs involved, any specific exemption for first-time buyers would have prevented a reduction in the rates for residential property generally.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Government considered that reductions in the stamp duty rates applicable to all residential property, as recommended in the Bacon report, would be more beneficial to first-time buyers and the housing market in general than a specific relief aimed at first-time buyers only.</P>

      <P>I expect to receive shortly from the Revenue Commissioners a copy of their technical review into the operation of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Scheme, S.I. No. 353 of 1994 refers.</P>
      <P>Six different types of disablement are listed in the S.I. and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them in order to benefit under the scheme.  For obvious reasons, the medical criteria are tightly drawn.  As I mentioned previously in the House, the reliefs under the scheme are targeted at those persons who are severely and permanently disabled with regard to physical mobility.  The last major review of the scheme was carried out in 1994.  It is intended that a further review, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will take place shortly.</P>
      <P>Where a person is refused the necessary primary certificate on the basis that the specified medical criteria are not met, this refusal may be appealed to the Disabled Drivers' Medical Board of Appeal, an independent board whose decision is final.  I am advised that the board received a total of 220 such appeals in 1997 and received 208 appeals to date this year.  Statistics relating to those appeals are not maintained in such a way as to enable the specific reasons for the initial refusal of certification to be determined.</P>

      <P>The report of the expert group on integrating the tax and social welfare systems, commonly referred to as the TWIG report, was published in 1996.  The group's terms of reference covered policy on both taxation and social welfare.  The recommendations <Col N="454" /> relating to social welfare measures are primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  The report contained three principal recommendations in relation to tax policy: the gradual elimination of the general income tax exemption limits thereby eliminating marginal relief; the gradual phasing out of the employment and training and health levies over time as resources permit which was started by converting the threshold into an allowance; and the improved co-ordination of tax and social welfare reforms.</P>
      <P>The exemption limit-marginal relief system was identified by the group as a contributory factor in unemployment and poverty traps.  The first of these recommendations is therefore being implemented in the manner recommended by the TWIG, by increasing personal allowances by more than the increase in the exemption limits, and I expect to continue this approach, as resources permit.  The numbers on marginal relief have fallen from over 16 per cent of the taxpaying population to under 7 per cent arising from measures introduced in the two previous budgets.</P>
      <P>The second recommendation concerning the levies has been addressed by increasing the threshold for the payment of the levies.  However, phasing out of the levies would be costly, and it would not benefit anyone with earnings below the threshold, currently £10,750 per year, though it would be of considerable benefit to those above this threshold.  This recommendation will be borne in mind in the context of the preparation of future budgets.</P>
      <P>On the third recommendation, the analysis undertaken by the expert group pointed to the benefits which could be obtained from a more co-ordinated approach to reforms of the tax and social welfare systems, and the need to study this interaction has been taken on board in the formulation of tax and social welfare packages in recent budgets.</P>
      <P>The contents of the TWIG report will continue to be taken into account in the formulation of proposals for further changes in the income tax system.</P>

      <P>In Securing Retirement Income, its report on the national pensions policy initiative published in May 1998, the Pensions Board recommended the establishment of an explicit mechanism to fund, at least partially, the prospective substantial growth in the cost of social welfare old age pensions. In welcoming the report, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs indicated that the Government considered that this recommendation <Col N="455" /> deserved full consideration.  To that end, a working group with representatives from the Departments of Finance, Social, Community and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Pensions Board was established and is currently giving detailed consideration to the matter.  Naturally, I will await the conclusions of the working group before forming a definitive view on this complex and important question.</P>

      <P>From 1 January 1999, there will be uniformity of short-term interest rates in the euro area, as set by the European Central Bank.  As regards the intervening period, interest rates in Ireland will continue to be a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland, which is independent in the implementation of monetary policy.  As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank cut official Irish interest rates with effect from Monday, 12 October in preparation for Ireland's participation in EMU. I would not speculate on the timing of further convergence of Irish interest rates between now and 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Government policy on the housing market is, in the first instance, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Environment and Local Government Deputy Dempsey.  It seems that obviously lower mortgage payments due to a fall in interest rates would benefit all variable rate mortgage holders, including first-time house buyers.  However, first-time house buyers would also be affected by a number of other factors, including the impact on house prices of, for example, the fall in interest rates and the Government's response to the Bacon report. Due to the complexities of the housing market, it is therefore not possible to precisely predict the net impact of interest rate reductions on first-time house buyers.</P>

      <P>Like other member states we do not tax non-resident deposits.  However, at the ECOFIN meeting in December 1997, member states agreed that a common EU framework to ensure a minimum of effective taxation of interest would be pursued.  It was agreed that the Commission's proposal, based on the co-existence model, would form the basis for progressing the matter.  The adoption of the co-existence model would give member states the option of either applying a withholding tax, levied at a proposed 20 per cent minimum rate by the paying agent, or of providing information on savings income to other member states, or using a combination of both systems.  Ireland supports the general thrust of these proposals.</P>
      <P>At this stage, however, the draft directive is under active consideration by a Council working group.  While it is the intention of EU Finance Ministers to complete the process by the middle of next year, there are a number of significant issues which need to be resolved.</P>

    <P>There was a reduction of 334, approximately 8 per cent, in the number of comprehensive audits carried out from 1996 to 1997.  The main reasons for this are:</P>
    <P>(i) A decision was made to advance more cases for civil and criminal prosecutions in 1997.  Twelve inspectors in investigation branch were assigned from case investigation and settlements to prosecution work and to work in connection with the tribunals of public enquiry.</P>
    <P>(ii) During 1997, 13 inspectors were deployed in servicing Revenue's commitment to the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and to other compliance duties in relation to pursuing arrears of tax payments and non submission of tax returns.</P>
    <P>(iii) Eleven experienced auditors were undergoing training on advanced auditing skills in relation to computer records for a substantial part of 1997.  This resulted in the reduction in the time spent on case work and accordingly a reduction in the number of audits carried out.</P>
    <P>(iv) A programme commenced in November 1997 to assess tax compliance in the construction industry in relation to relevant contracts tax and PAYE/PRSI.  This resulted in a reduction in audit numbers during November and December 1997.  The same position applies to the first nine months of 1998.</P>
    <P>(v) It is expected that there will be a further reduction in the number of comprehensive audits carried on in 1998.  This reflects primarily the concentration of auditors on more complex cases which take longer to complete.  However, yield figures will not be affected as auditors are recovering more tax as a result of better targeting of cases.</P>
    <P>The reduction in yield from comprehensive audits between 1996 and 1997 of approximately 13 per cent, or £9 million in cash terms, reflects generally the reduction of 8 per cent in the number of audits carried out.  Additionally there was a reduction of £3 million approximately in the aggregate yield from the top ten yielding cases in 1997 when compared with 1996.</P>

      <P>The elderly are treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than the generality of taxpayers. The exemption limits for those aged 65 and over are significantly higher than those which apply generally.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to providing special relief for old age pensioners by raising the exemption limits.  In my 1998 budget, I announced a substantial increase in the exemption limits for the elderly of £400 single/£800 married to £5,000 single/£10,000 married for those aged 65 to 74 and of £300 single/£600 married to £5,500 single/£11,000 married for those aged 75 and over, which have taken effect from the new tax year.  This compares with the general exemption limits of £4,100 single/£8,200 married.</P>
      <P>Where pensioners aged 65 and over are taxed under the normal personal allowance tax system they are eligible for the special age allowance of £400 single/£800 married, which is in addition to the normal personal allowances.  In this instance, the elderly will benefit from the general tax improvements introduced in the 1998 budget e.g. the increase in personal allowances of £250 single/£500 married to £3,150 single/£6,300 married, the widening of the standard band by £100 single/£200 married and the 2 per cent reduction in both the standard and top income tax rates.</P>
      <P>I will bear in mind the tax position of the elderly in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>From the outset, my Department has participated fully in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy (NAPS) process and this continues to be the case.  This involvement includes membership of the InterDepartmental Policy Committee on the NAPS which, under the direction of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion, is the administrative mechanism for progressing the NAPS strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public expenditure, taxation and incomes policies adopted by the Government and implemented by the Department of Finance have underpinned the current economic success which <Col N="459" /> is delivering an unprecedented rate of increase in employment and providing the resources which are enabling considerable social progress to be made.  The NAPS Strategy Statement recognised that the unemployed were the group at the greatest risk of poverty and that the most effective way of reducing poverty was through the creation of jobs.  Accordingly, the continued rapid fall in unemployment &mdash; particularly long-term unemployment &mdash; represents substantial progress towards meeting the overall NAPS target of reducing the numbers of consistently poor from 9 to 15 per cent of the population in 1997 to less than 5 to 10 per cent by the year 2007.  Another indication of progress towards this target was that, following the 1998 budget initiatives, the three-year Partnership 2000 commitment for expenditure on social inclusion measures was met in two years.</P>
    <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that NAPS considerations will be taken into account in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>Reflecting the recent Government approval of a poverty proofing framework, my Department is aware of the need to give appropriate attention to the assessment of the impact which proposed measures will have in terms of promoting social inclusion and combating poverty and disadvantage in all its forms.  The Department also supported the introduction of poverty proofing in the budgetary process so as to ensure that all Departments will consider the overall impact of their activities on those in poverty when submitting relevant proposals.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House that arrangements are being made to extend the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to health boards and local authorities with effect from 21 October.  It has also been decided to extend the Act to cover voluntary hospitals.  The Minister for Health and Children is engaging in discussion with relevant interests with a view to securing an early commencement date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards further extension of the Act, this will be examined on the basis of the broad policy approach adopted since the time of enactment of FOI.  Simply stated, our position has been that FOI policy should initially apply at central Government level and be incrementally extended across the public service.  This is currently under way.  In my view, it is essential that we firmly root FOI at central and local government level before further extending it across the public service.  In <Col N="460" /> this way, adequate preparations can be undertaken by the public bodies concerned, appropriate support can be provided centrally, and best practices can be identified and promulgated.</P>

      <P>Informal council meetings provide an opportunity for Ministers to have a general discussion on issues which will feature on the agendas of future formal councils.  It is not the practice for such meetings to take decisions.  At the informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers in Vienna last month, we discussed a range of issues including the co-ordination of taxation policies, the situation in Russia and Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>Ministers held an informal exchange of views on the co-ordination of taxation policies in the context of EMU and the Single Market.  It was agreed that the primary focus of member states and the Commission should be on implementing the measures in the tax package adopted at ECOFIN last December.  In this context it was noted that work was about to commence on the review of taxation measures coming within the scope of the code of conduct on business taxation.  It was agreed that an interim progress report on the tax package would be prepared for the ECOFIN meeting in December 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers also discussed the international economic situation, including the crisis in Russia.  Austria, as the current holder of the EU Presidency, issued a statement on these matters which stated that solutions depend on national economic and political situations and that restructuring the financial and corporate sectors will lay the foundation for recovery.  The implementation of a supportive demand policy and the restructuring of the banking sector in Japan were seen as being of the utmost importance in this respect.  The statement also welcomed the formation of a Government in Russia and repeated the call made in the EU Ministers' Declaration of 6 September last to proceed along the path of structural reforms in order to establish the foundations of a social market economy.  The situation in Latin America was also discussed in some detail and the statement expressed confidence in the prospects for Latin America and its ability to overcome the current instability of international markets.  The important role of the IMF in crisis prevention was also recognised and it was agreed that IMF quota increases should be urgently implemented.  As regards Russia, the statement emphasised the contribution that EU instruments such as TACIS can make, along with the technical assistance programmes of EU member states.  Finally, the statement noted that the European Union is conspicuous in today's world economy as a pole of <Col N="461" /> stability conducive to economic and employment growth.</P>

      <P>The independence of the European Central Bank, ECB, and of the national central banks in the exercise of the tasks of the European System of Central Banks, composed of the ECB and national central banks, is explicitly guaranteed by the treaty establishing the European Community. Such independence is, of course, counterbalanced by an appropriate degree of accountability and this is also provided for in the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the treaty, the ECB must draw up and publish reports on the activities of the European System of Central Banks, ESCB, at least quarterly. The ECB must submit an annual report on <Col N="462" /> the activities of the ESCB and on the monetary policy of both the previous and current year to the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission and also to the European Council. The President of the ECB must present this report to the Council and to the European Parliament, which may hold a general debate on the report.  The President of the ECB and the other members of the executive board may, at the request of the European Parliament or on their own initiative, appear before the competent committees of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The treaty also provides for a framework for continuous dialogue between the Council of Ministers and the ECB, respecting their respective competences.  The President of the Council of Ministers may participate, without having the right to vote, in meetings of the ECB Governing Council and may submit motions for deliberation. The President of the ECB shall be invited to participate in council meetings when the council is discussing matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB.</P>
    <P>In addition to these treaty requirements, the ECB will be invited to take part, when appropriate, at the informal meetings of the Euro-11 group comprising the Ministers of the States participating in the euro area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the President of the ECB has indicated that he will hold a press conference, normally once a month, after one of the fortnightly meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB.  It is also expected that the ECB will keep the public informed about its activities through speeches and regular publications.</P>
    <P>I believe that these arrangements represent an appropriate balance between safeguarding the independence of the ECB and ensuring that it is accountable and transparent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, sets out the Central Bank's confidentiality obligations.  The section has been amended on a number of occasions since then.  These amendments have mostly been concerned with extending the list of bodies to which the bank can disclose information in accordance with EU law on prudential supervision. Other legislative provisions are also relevant. Under section 49(2) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Central Bank may disclose to the gardaí, where it has reasonable cause to believe that a criminal offence has been committed, any information to enable further investigation of the alleged offence.  Further, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, the bank is obliged to report to the Garda <Col N="463" /> a suspicion that any entity it supervises has committed or is committing the offence of money laundering or certain related offences; money laundering embraces tax evasion.</P>
      <P>Confidentiality is a core element in the prudential regulation of financial institutions, not only in Ireland and the European Union, but internationally. It is seen as a necessary balance to the extremely wide powers of intrusion and information gathering provided to the Central Bank and other supervisors in legislation.  Irish law on confidentiality in financial supervision implements European Union law which requires a high standard of professional secrecy.  Article 12 of the First Council Directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions requires the State to ensure that the Central Bank maintains very strict confidentiality.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals at this point to amend section 16.  However, the Deputy will be aware that earlier this year I established an interdepartmental working group representative of the Departments of Finance, the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General, The mandate of the group is &ldquo;to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers&rdquo;.  It was also to consider what steps may be required to increase the public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.  I understand that a very significant amount of work has been undertaken on a wide range of issues related to banking and consumer matters.  In particular, I understand that a considerable amount of time has been spent in addressing the complex legal question of Central Bank confidentiality restrictions in the context of EU law, with a view to establishing the extent to which, if any, the provisions of the latter would permit any change in present domestic legislation.</P>
      <P>The work of the group has taken longer than anticipated, but the issues involved are both complex and important.  I understand, however, that the group's deliberations are nearing finality.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the unilateral declaration on open government by Sweden on <Col N="464" /> its accession to the EU, which was incorporated into the final document of the EU enlargement conference.  The position is that access to information under Swedish law dates back to 1766. Clearly their legislation could not have anticipated EU arrangements.  Accordingly, this declaration was unilaterally entered into by Sweden on its accession to the EU in 1994 with a view to preserving their existing statutory rights.</P>
      <P>The situation in this country is somewhat different.  As the Deputy will appreciate, our EU membership precedes freedom of information by decades.  Accordingly, when developing our freedom of information legislation we were well positioned to consider and address EU arrangements.</P>
      <P>Following from this, section 24 of our Freedom of Information Act permits the refusal of records where their disclosure could be expected to adversely affect the international relations of the State.  Such records are specified as including, where appropriate, information communicated in confidence from the EU or its subsidiaries.</P>
      <P>The intention of the provision is to uphold our international obligations while at the same time enabling maximum access to relevant records. Against this background, a particular agreement with the EU relating to our Freedom of Information Act would not appear warranted.</P>
      <P>However, I appreciate the point raised by the Deputy.  I will keep under review the operation of provisions referred to so as to ensure that they are applied consistent with the principles and purposes of the Freedom of Information Act.</P>

For assistant secretary level posts, the TLAC selects the successful candidate, who is appointed by the Minister in charge of the Department concerned. For Secretary General level posts, the TLAC draws up a list of three qualified candidates from which the Government selects the appointee.  The application of a TLAC-type arrangement to posts in the Department of Foreign Affairs is under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At other levels, promotion posts are filled through a number of mechanisms.  Generally, about one third of such vacancies are filled from &ldquo;order of merit&rdquo; panels constituted by the Civil Service Commission following interdepartmental competition.  The remaining vacancies are filled &ldquo;internally&rdquo; by Departments.  The method of filling such vacancies may vary &mdash; some may be filled by internal competition and the use of this method is increasing, particularly at middle management level; some may be filled through what is known as the &ldquo;consistory&rdquo; approach where management consider the suitability of the eligible field of officers for whatever vacancies may <Col N="466" /> be on offer; or departments may fill vacancies on a &ldquo;senior suitable&rdquo; basis, where management considers the &ldquo;seniority&rdquo; list and selects the most senior officer who is deemed suitable for promotion.</P>
    <P>Under section 4(1)(h) of the Public Service Management Act, 1997, and subject to the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, the obligations of the Secretary General include managing all matters pertaining to appointments, performance, discipline or dismissal of staff below the grade of principal or its equivalent.  Section 7, which provides that a Minister may, in writing, give directions to a Secretary General in connection with the obligations assigned under the Act, does not extend to section 4(1)(h).</P>
    <P>In relation to arrangements for promotion at principal or its equivalent level and above where interdepartmental or TLAC procedures do not apply, the experience has been that Ministers have involved themselves sparingly, and not in a way which would give rise to suspicion of political favouritism.</P>

The other measures taken include: speeding up direct payments to farmers; an increased advance on suckler cow and special beef payments from 60 per cent to 80 per cent &mdash; this will release an additional £45 million in November and December; more rapid payments of REPS where such payments are falling due; payment of outstanding BSE compensation top-ups of £6 million to certain beef producers in early October; arrangements for Teagasc to hold special free advisory clinics on fodder in the areas affected; promoting live exports and reopening trade with Libya and Iran; achieving a substantial increase in beef export refunds on 25 September &mdash; the increase is equivalent to 5p per lb.  of beef; ensuring appropriate transport facilities are available for live exports, and private storage schemes for sheepmeat and pigmeat.  In addition, agreement in principle has been reached with the European Commission to include 04 grades in the eligibility criteria for intervention.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of aid for private storage which was recently introduced by the EU Commission, 450 tonnes of lamb may be placed in private cold storage in Ireland at a rate of aid of 1400 ecu per tonne, equivalent to about 50p per lb.  At the same time similar schemes were introduced for the United Kingdom and Finland for 2,000 tonnes and 150 tonnes respectively.</P>
      <P>Lambs under one year old may be put into storage in carcass or half carcass form in the period between 19 October and 20 November for a period of three to seven months.  An additional amount of aid of 1.45 ecu per tonne per day is payable for product held in storage beyond three months.</P>
      <P>The scheme which runs from 19 October to 20 November could be worth over £500,000 to Ireland and, if fully availed of, would remove 23,000 lambs from the market.  I have called upon sheep processing plants to maximise the use of the scheme to give a boost to the autumn lamb market.</P>

At a standing veterinary committee meeting on 7 January, which was attended by representatives of my Department, the EU Commission gave details of an outbreak of avian flu in Hong Kong transmissible from birds to humans.  Sixteen cases of the virus were confirmed in humans, four of whom died.  Hong Kong took stringent measures to deal with the outbreak including the slaughtering of all poultry, a total of 1.3 million birds.  Immediate action was taken by the EU which banned all imports of live birds from Hong Kong and mainland China.  As neither Hong Kong nor China were approved for the export of live poultry to the EU, the ban affected cage birds only.  Neither Hong Kong nor China are approved for the export of poultry meat and poultry meat products to the EU.</P>

      <P>The currency of the economic and monetary union (EMU), which will begin on 1 January 1999, will be the euro.  Under article 105 of the EU Treaty, the European system of central banks is responsible for defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Community and for conducting foreign exchange operations in relation to the euro. Any action to defend the euro by way of interest rate changes or foreign exchange intervention would be a matter for the European central bank (ECB).</P>
      <P>As far as the member states participating in EMU are concerned, the Treaty provides for the ECB to be provided with foreign reserve assets by the national central banks of euro-area member states.  The ECB currently has foreign reserve assets equivalent to around Euro 40 billion. Further calls of foreign reserve assets may be effected by the ECB within the limits and under the conditions set by the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he feels necessary to protect the IR£ after 1 January 1999 having regard to the volume of trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom and the non-participation in EMU by the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Ireland will participate in economic and monetary union (EMU) from 1 January 1999, when our currency will be the euro. The euro conversion rate of the Irish pound will be consistent with ERM central rates, as announced on 2 May last; the ERM central rate of the IR£ against the Deutsch Mark is DM 2.48338. Under the EU Treaty, the European system of central banks is responsible for defining and implementing the monetary policy of the Community and conducting foreign exchange operations in relation to the euro.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom represents a substantial but declining proportion of Ireland's trade with other countries.  Under the terms of a protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty, the UK has notified the Council of Ministers that it does not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999; the UK may, however, reverse its notification at any time after the beginning of that stage.</P>
      <P>The position of the UK is therefore that of a non-participating member state.  However, economic and monetary interdependence between participating and non-participating member states will be strong and the UK will be included with all the other member states in the co-ordination of economic policies at EU level.  In particular, Article 109m of the EU Treaty requires that each member state treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest.</P>
      <P>A key concern for many Irish individuals and firms is, of course, how sterling will perform against the euro.  The current strength of sterling provides opportunities for Irish businesses to improve competitiveness and enhance its capacity to deal with shocks, wherever they might come from.  The Government is not ignoring the need to prepare for the possibility, no matter how remote, of problems arising for Irish industry as a consequence of sterling falling significantly below its equilibrium level.  Last July, as part of its EMU business awareness campaign, Forfás published a document which identifies actions in the fields of finance, marketing and distribution that firms could consider as part of their planning to cope with any fluctuations in exchange rates that may arise between the euro and sterling.  The document is included in the campaign's information pack for business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the pay terms of Partnership 2000 are, in general, holding in the private sector.  I recognise that there are pressures on pay, particularly in the construction industry, possibly reflecting sectoral labour shortages in some instances.  Government policy is directed at ensuring that skilled labour supply is maintained and, thus, that sectoral strains do not become serious and do not spill over into the economy generally.</P>
      <P>As regards the public service, my Department has issued guidelines to all Departments concerning the management and control of public service pay during the period of the Partnership 2000 pay agreement.  These guidelines emphasise the absolute necessity for strict compliance with the pay terms of Partnership 2000 in the public service.</P>
      <P>Departments have also been instructed, in the context of preparing the multi-annual estimates for the period 1999-2001, to include in their Estimates the cost of the pay terms of Partnership 2000 and it has been made clear to them that no provision will be made for any increase in excess of these terms.  Accordingly, the full cost of all Partnership 2000 pay increases, including the 2 per cent local level negotiations increase, will be incorporated into each Department's Estimate for 1999 and beyond, and each Department will be required to live within this provision.</P>
      <P>My most recent contact with the social partners, including ICTU, on Partnership 2000 was at the plenary meeting on 28 July 1998 to monitor progress on Partnership 2000.  In my address to the meeting, I emphasised the need for strict compliance with the pay terms of Partnership 2000.  We are not going to countenance a repetition under Partnership 2000 of the drift which occurred under the PCW.</P>
      <P>In general, therefore, while there is no evidence that the pay guidelines in Partnership 2000 are not being maintained, neither is there any room for complacency.  All parties to Partnership 2000 must remain vigilant in ensuring that the commitments entered into continue to be observed.</P>

    <P>The Commissioners have also informed me that they do not, as a matter of routine, analyse their vehicle registration by reference to vehicle manufacturer, as requested by the Deputy.  However, such specific analysis is published monthly by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry derived from the Commissioners' statistics.</P>
    <P>Vehicle registration taxes of one form or another are applied in many EU member states. These taxes are operated in a variety of ways and as such are not directly comparable.  However, judging from receipts from registrations taxes as a percentage of GDP, Ireland is among those EU states such as Denmark, Portugal, the Nether-lands, Finland and Greece which rely more heavily on such taxes rather than other member states.</P>

      <P>The Government decision which permitted pensioners to benefit on a parity basis from PCW restructuring pay deals provided that only increases which represented permanent additions to the pay scales were to apply to pensioners.  The long service increment paid to former grade IIIs, as part of the PCW pay deal for clerical/administrative grades I to VII, is not a permanent addition to the pay scale.  It is paid on a personal basis only to those who were serving grade IIIs on 1 June 1996 and those appointed <Col N="480" /> between that date and 30 July 1997 when a single new grade, with the title clerical officer, replaced the former grades I, II and III.  This particular PCW restructuring pay deal differs from that agreed for other grades.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the National Task Force on Suicide Report earlier this year, each of the relevant agencies, including health boards, were contacted by my Department to request early implementation of the recommendations in so far as the individual agencies were concerned. Each health board is currently examining ways of implementing the report's recommendations which impinge on health board services.  The establishment of a suicide research group by the chief executive officers of the health boards is central to the strategy to reduce suicide and attempted suicide.  The suicide research group will be aided by resource officers in each health board area.  I understand that three health boards have appointed such officers with the remaining health boards currently in the process of appointing officers.</P>

At its June 1998 meeting the South-Eastern Health Board undertook to do repair and maintenance work at the hospital and a sum of £100,000 was provided by the board for this purpose.  I understand a structural engineer's report was subsequently sought by the board due to concerns about the structural quality of the ageing building. In the circumstances work was deferred pending a detailed examination.  The health board have confirmed that the £100,000 is still available for this project and it is the board's intention to progress this work in the coming months.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a relatively small number of operations have been carried out over the past six weeks where six consultants are attached to the Regional Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene, County Kilkenny, which was closed down for surgery during August 1998, in view of the large waiting list of patients awaiting elective surgery there; the number of individual days during the past six weeks that the theatre has been utilised; the activities carried out therein; the cost involved; if he has satisfied himself that this is value for taxpayers money; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The provision of services at the Lourdes Hospital, Kilcreene is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The board has informed me that in the six weeks from 31 August 1998 to 9 October 1998, 11 theatre days were cancelled for a variety of reasons including annual leave, emergency/on-call commitments at Waterford Regional Hospital and as a result of reviews of theatre lists.  To obtain an accurate reflection of how the hospital is performing against its service plan it is, of course, more relevant to examine its activity over the full 12 months of the year. In this context, it should be noted that overall activity at the hospital for the first nine months of this year has, according to the health board, exceeded service plan projections by approximately 5 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year, hospitals are notified of their noncapital allocation and a service plan is drawn up by them and agreed with the Department.  This plan sets down parameters for activity for the year and hospitals are required to maintain activity levels within the hospital's agreed parameters. Detailed decisions in relation to hospital spending are a matter for the hospital management. The hospital's chief executive officer advised my Department last week that as part of its service planning within budget they will be closing 31 beds in Our Lady's Ward until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The accident and emergency department at the Mater Hospital provides a 24-hour service.  Due to the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>All patients, whilst in the accident and emergency department, are under the care of medical and nursing staff.  Every endeavour is made to make patients as comfortable as possible while they are awaiting a hospital bed.  The position regarding accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, I made an additional allocation of £200,000 available to the Mater Hospital at the start of this year to help alleviate any problems which may occur in its accident and emergency department.</P>

      <P>Foynes water supply improvement scheme is included in my Department's 1998 Water and Sewerage Services Investment Programme as a scheme to be advanced through planning, and the local authority's proposals were approved in August last. The approval allows the local authority to commence preparation of contract documents for the scheme which involves the replacement of 507 metres of 750mm diameter main, flood diversion and advance works on the Foynes main drainage scheme, improvements to the water and fire protection systems in Foynes, the recommissioning of a 750mm diameter main and improvement works to the water treatment plant.  This work will be additional to the provision of a fail safe valve control system already installed at the reservoir in Foynes by the local authority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>The operation and management of public libraries is a matter in the first instance for library authorities and I do not have a controlling function in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that in 1996, the latest year for which complete figures are available, there were 318 branch libraries and a further, 949 library service points in operation.  My Department does not hold details of where each of these is located.</P>
      <P>I also understand that 20 out of 32 library authorities provide information and communications technology (ICT) for public use.  This is used to access library catalogues, to access material stored on CD-ROM, for word-processing and spreadsheet applications and for some ICT training.  A number of library authorities also provide access to the Internet for the public.</P>
      <P>Twenty four library authorities also have contracts with vendors of computer-based library management systems.  These systems perform housekeeping functions for the library such as management of circulations, catalogues, membership etc.</P>
      <P>My Department currently supports the funding of ICT for public use in libraries as part of an overall programme of financial support for developing public library infrastructure.  In addition, my Department makes available a once-off grant of up to £40,000 to assist library authorities in providing computer-based library management systems.</P>
      <P>I consider that the provision of services to the public through the application of ICT is a very important policy issue for public libraries.  It is open to everybody to join a library; it follows therefore that libraries have the potential to provide access to the advantages of the information age for the general public.  In this way the public library service can contribute in a significant way to the development of an equitable information society in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The role of ICT in libraries is one part of a general review of public library policy that has just concluded and which is due to report to me in the next two weeks.  The allocation of funding by my Department for the future development of ICT in public libraries will take account of the contents of this review.</P>

      <P>The only grant available from my Department to meet the accommodation needs of a disabled member of a household is the £3,000 new house grant which may be paid for the provision of a suitably designed or specially adapted new house specifically to meet the needs of the disabled person.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 166 and 171 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was made available to the scheme in 1996, and some 15,000 individuals were assisted that year.  In 1997 an initial allocation of £2 million was again made to the scheme.</P>
      <P>I sought and received approval from Government to allocate an additional £3 million to the scheme, thus allowing the Department to assist some 21,000 individuals in 1997.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was again allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people and a significant number of people have benefited in this regard.  I am anxious to ensure that the scheme has sufficient resources allocated to it to ensure that a meaningful response can be made to the large number of applications received this year, while at the same time ensuring that the scheme remains focused and provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. There has again been a very high level of demand in relation to the scheme this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reviewed the position and, as already announced, I have obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme in 1998.  I envisage that the 1998 grants will be made, within the revised allocation, within the next few weeks.  The additional allocation brings the amount made available over <Col N="490" /> the past two years to £10 million.  This represents a significant increase in the level of support for the scheme and will provide the necessary resources to meet the volume of worthwhile applications received.</P>
    <P>There is a need to ensure that the scheme remains focused and provides assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible.  In this regard, my Department has, in consultation with the Departments of Finance and Health and Children, commissioned an independent review of the scheme which will consider how the scheme is meeting its objectives and whether it is doing so in the most efficient and effective way possible. This final report from the consultants will be available later this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Jobs facilitators form the core of my Department's employment support service.  The service, which was established in 1993 at a time when the level of unemployment was increasing, was intended to support and encourage unemployed people, particularly the long-term unemployed, to take up employment or self-employment and to help in directing available employment, training, etc.  opportunities to them.  The back-to-work allowance was introduced at the same time as a specific incentive for long-term unemployed <Col N="491" /> people to ease the transition back into the active workforce.</P>
    <P>The range of supports which job facilitators could provide has expanded over the years.  My Department has 30 jobs facilitators operating at local level throughout the country.  Ten were appointed initially in 1993, a further ten in 1994 and the remainder in 1995.  In addition there are ten co-ordinators at regional level to whom the job facilitators report and a central support unit for the employment support service generally.</P>
    <P>Jobs facilitators have been particularly successful in encouraging over 40,000 unemployed people to take up employment or self-employment opportunities with the support of the back-to-work allowance.  Advice and expertise in relation to business start-up, marketing, book-keeping, etc.  is widely available from organisations such as FÁS, the local employment service and the area based partnership companies.  Jobs facilitators will arrange training for unemployed people starting a business with these organisations and also with professional companies which specialise in relevant training in that area.</P>
    <P>The total number of Back to Work allowance participants at the end of December each year since 1994 and the number of those in self-employment is as follows:</P>

It is my intention that these efforts will be intensified and that a pro-active approach aimed at helping unemployed people back into employment, training, education etc., will continue to be a central feature of the Department's service to clients. Improved co-operation with other staff agencies such as FÁS and the local employment service will be an important feature of this approach.</P>
    <P>The evaluation of the Back to Work allowance which was commissioned by my Department, and which I published last year, highlighted the importance of an adequate range of supports for unemployed people wishing to return to the workforce and recommended an expansion in the current role of the jobs facilitators to assist in this.</P>
    <P>I am considering how best the range of my Department's services for unemployed people might be developed in the future and will be considering the role of the job facilitators in that context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has, since 1996, operated the scheme of community support for older people, the purpose of which is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people.  This funding is provided by way of grant to voluntary groups who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>A sum of £2 million was made available to the scheme in 1996, and some 15,000 individuals were assisted that year.  In 1997 an initial allocation of £2 million was again made to the scheme.</P>
      <P>However, I sought and received approval from Government to allocate an additional £3 million to the scheme, thus allowing the Department to assist some 21,000 individuals in 1997.</P>
      <P>The closing date for applications for the 1998 scheme was 22 May and applications received before that date are being considered in the regional offices of my Department, which process applications under the scheme.  A sum of £2 million was again allocated to the scheme in the 1998 Estimates.  The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of the purchase and/or installation of the necessary equipment.  The actual amount of the grant varies in the light of individual circumstances and needs and the overall demands which must be met.</P>
      <P>The objective of the scheme is to address the security needs of vulnerable older people and a significant number of people have benefited in this regard.  I am anxious to ensure that the scheme has sufficient resources allocated to it to ensure that a meaningful response can be made to the large number of applications received this year, while at the same time ensuring that the scheme remains focused and provides this assistance in the most efficient and effective way possible. There has again been a very high level of demand in relation to the scheme this year and I am aware of the hardship that may be caused to individuals who would not be in a position to make a substantial contribution to the cost of the equipment themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have reviewed the position and I have obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme in 1998. I envisage that the 1998 grants will be made, within the revised allocation, within the next few weeks.  The additional allocation brings the amount made available over the past two years to £10 million.  This represents a significant increase in the level of support for this scheme <Col N="493" /> and will provide the necessary resources to meet the volume of worthwhile applications received.</P>
    <P>I confirm that an application has been received from the group mentioned in the Deputy's question. My Department expect to be in a position soon to advise the group of the decision regarding its application under the scheme.</P>

      <P>A number of proposals have been made in recent years for the Magazine Fort in the Phoenix Park and while refurbishment of it would be highly desirable this would inevitably be a multi-million pound project.  Given the demands on the funds at my disposal, comprehensive restoration of the fort is not a viable proposition at present.  However, with the objective of preserving the fabric of the principal buildings, particularly the magazines themselves, roofing and repair works have been undertaken in recent years.</P>

      <P>Utilisation of the site nearer the town centre would necessitate the excavation of a new channel along what is at present a minor river, underpinning of the East Bridge, excavation of a harbour area large enough for the provision of jetties and the turning of boats, and works to take account of flooding in the winter months.  It is estimated that the cost of these works would be of the order of £300,000 to £500,000 in excess of the costs of providing moorings on the left bank of the Suck.  The Deputy will appreciate that funding of this magnitude could not be justified.  In the circumstances, it is proposed to provide the moorings at the original location on the left bank and downstream of the East Bridge.</P>

      <P>The following Table 1 lists (a) the sites entered on the Register of National Monuments and (b) Preservation Orders made under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 1994, since my appointment as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Broadly speaking, such individual registrations and the making of preservation orders take place where it appears to me that the sites in question may be at risk.</P>
      <P>In addition, specifically in accordance with section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994 and regulations made on 14 November 1994, entitled the National Monuments (Exhibition of Record of Monuments) Regulations, 1994 (S.  I. No. 341 of 1994), I am obliged to establish a statutory &ldquo;Record of Monuments and Places&rdquo; which affords legal protection to all known or suspected sites and monuments.</P>
      <P>The record consists of a set of constraint maps with an accompanying index, prepared on a county basis, which shows the locations of &ldquo;Monuments and Places&rdquo; which are protected under the Acts.  In order to give effect to these provisions a &ldquo;Record of Monuments and Places&rdquo; has been established for 25 counties and is available for inspection by members of the public at various venues, mainly local authority offices, county libraries, farm development offices and Teagasc offices during normal public opening hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government notices providing information on the &ldquo;Record of Monument and Places&rdquo; were placed in the main newspapers as detailed on the following Table 2.  These were followed by notices in the main local newspapers.  During my tenure as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, protection has thus been extended to an additional 40,000 monuments approximately in eight counties countrywide.  The Record of Monument and Places for County Cork, 15,810 sites approximately, is the only outstanding <Col N="495" /> record and is scheduled for completion later this year, after which all Recorded Monuments and <Col N="496" /> Places throughout the State will enjoy legal protection. The Deputy will acknowledge that this is a major achievement in its own right.</P>

      <P>There are no plans for a dedicated national children's theatre.  However, the Ark in Temple Bar, Dublin, to which the Arts Council made a revenue grant of £378,000 this year, is an arts centre designed and programmed exclusively for cultural work by children, for children and about children.  It provides for children between the ages of four and 14 as citizens with cultural entitlements, including theatre.  In addition, the Arts Council is making grants totalling £675,000 this year to other organisations involved in the provision of drama for young people.</P>

The most recent information in relation to the yellow-hammer population in Ireland is contained in <i>The New Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland</i> (Field Work 1988-91), which estimated an Irish population of 200,000 pairs.  This publication indicated a significant decline in the range of this species in Ireland, particularly in the western counties.</P>
      <P>I have recently been presented with the first annual report of the countryside bird survey which is a co-operative effort by Dúchas, the heritage service of my Department, the Heritage Council, the Electricity Supply Board and Bird Watch Ireland in providing baseline data and a continuing monitoring function in relation to our common birds, including the yellow-hammer. This survey is designed to provide information on a year to year basis on population trends, to promote greater understanding of the factors responsible for these trends, to identify appropriate conservation measures if required, and to provide an indicator of the environmental status of the countryside.  It is a substantial undertaking which will, I hope, in the years to come, provide an important barometer of the status of many of our important bird populations, including the yellow-hammer.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that hedgerows are currently afforded protection by means of section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and Regulation 26 of the European Communities, (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997, which transposed Article 10 of the EU Habitats Directive.  While local authorities are exempt from the provisions of section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, due mainly to their safety obligations for public roads, it has been the practice to call for co-operation on the part of the local authorities and the public in general in helping to ensure that hedge cutting operations are only undertaken outside the critical nesting period in order to prevent the destruction of wildlife habitats during the breeding season and, in particular, those of nesting birds.  The national parks and wildlife, NPW, division of Dúchas the heritage service of my Department, wrote some time ago to all local authorities seeking their co-operation in this matter and the response from the authorities was very positive.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government, in its booklet <i>Memorandum on Grants for Non-National Roads 1996-1999</i>, sets out guidelines for road authorities on roadside trimming.  In particular, the guidelines state that local authorities should carry out roadside trimming, including hedge cutting, during the winter months where there is least risk to the ecological environment; the periods coinciding with nest building and rearing of young should be avoided; and the timing and manner of execution of such trimming work should seek to minimise possible damage to plants and wild flowers in hedgerows.  Section 19 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, as amended, requires planning authorities when preparing their development plans to include objectives for the conservation and protection of European sites.  Part IV of the Third Schedule has been amended to afford protection to features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora.  This amendment directly transposes Article 10 of the Habitats Directive.</P>
      <P>Protection is also afforded to hedgerows under measures 4, 5 and supplementary measure 1 of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme, REPS, administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  The Deputy should also be aware that the issue of hedgerow conservation, including any further possible legal or other measures which might be required, if any, is currently being considered by me in the context of the amendment of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the development of a national biodiversity plan.</P>

      <P>Since coming into office, I have been concerned at the large number of untrained personnel working as substitutes within the primary school system.  While I acknowledge that many of these persons have made a contribution to the primary educational system, there is a need to ensure that as far as possible only qualified personnel are employed to perform substitute teaching.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I have introduced a range of measures which are designed to boost substantially the supply of trained teachers.  Soon after my appointment I increased the number of primary teacher training places.  This year, I have ensured that there are over 1,000 places available in the colleges of education during the current academic year.  This includes 730 students who will pursue the three year B. Ed.  degree programme while 280 degree holders will be admitted to an 18 month full-time post-graduate course.</P>
      <P>Additionally, B. Ed.  graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualification will be recognised as fully trained.</P>
      <P>I am also examining the possibility of the University of Limerick providing a one-year conversion course for degree holders who hold the Higher Diploma in Education and who either have Irish as part of their degree or have Irish to grade C at the leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
      <P>The existing body of untrained substitutes can in general terms be distinguished into three broad categories.</P>
      <P>Firstly, there are those who hold a primary degree and the Higher Diploma in Education. From 1 September, 1998, all primary degree holders who also hold the Higher Diploma in Education will be recognised as fully trained for the purposes of providing substitution service provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate standard or its equivalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, Montessori trained teachers who successfully completed the course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, and which is recognised by the National Council for Educational Awards, will from 1 September 1998, be granted recognition as fully trained substitutes <Col N="505" /> provided that they have Irish to grade C at higher level leaving certificate or its equivalent.</P>
    <P>Most persons falling within the third category do not have third level qualifications.  At this stage, there are no plans to remunerate these substitutes at the trained substitute teacher rates.</P>

      <P>Every effort is made, by my Department, to ensure that the result of rechecks are made available as quickly as possible to candidates.</P>
      <P>In 1998, in the interests of greater openness and transparency, I arranged for candidates for the first time ever to have access to their marked examination scripts in many subjects.  As a result candidates were in a position to make a more informed decision regarding the need to appeal. To provide time for this very worthwhile and innovative development it was necessary to have a later closing date for appeal applications and it was moved back from 27 August in 1997 to 9 September this year.  In extending the timescale for appeals I was also addressing concerns that in previous years candidates were placed under extreme time pressure in reaching a decision as to whether or not to appeal.</P>
      <P>The appeal process involves a full remarking of the candidates work and it is necessary to provide examiners with adequate time to engage in that task.  This year my Department issued the outcome of appeals to schools and the central applications office on 8 October.</P>
      <P>In relation to course offers every effort is made by third level colleges to ensure that candidates who qualify for a particular course as a result of an upgrade are facilitated in taking up that course.</P>

    <P>I recognise the benefit of the earliest possible notification of the outcome for candidates who qualify for a revised course offer and wish to take up that revised offer.  My Department will continue <Col N="506" /> to work to ensure that the outcome of appeals is available at the earliest possible date having regard to the clear desirability of providing candidates with an opportunity to view their scripts and the requirements of the remarking process itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to giving primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in the policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium. This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 estimates, where I provided for an overall increase of almost 12 per cent in expenditure on primary education over the 1997 budget allocation. In this context, the 11 per cent increase in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level represented an important step forward in the process of increasing capitation funding at primary level.</P>
      <P>It is important to note, however, that the difference in grant level reflects the fact that maintenance costs for second level schools are much greater on a unit cost basis than those in primary schools.  In addition, the second level capitation payment is required to cover a different range of expenditures.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to give priority to the issue of further increases in the capitation grant to primary schools.</P>
      <P>In relation to security arrangements, it is open to a school management to apply to my Department for grant aid towards capital improvements to their facilities.  The process of dealing with applications is set out in the publication, National School Capital Programme, which issued to all schools in 1994.  Since then, a devolved grant scheme has commenced under which each national school is paid a basic annual capital grant of £2,000 plus £9 per pupil, which may be spent by the school on improvement works to buildings, services, grounds and furnishings.  Such improvements could also include works to upgrade a school's security measures.</P>

      <P>Children with special educational needs are identified through the professional assessment services.  Psychological or medical reports will identify the nature and degree of disability or other special need involved.  Such reports will also indicate the required response for the child concerned.</P>
      <P>These assessment reports are usually made available, with parental consent, to the school the pupil attends or proposes to attend, together with the outcome of any reviews conducted by the appropriate assessment services and any relevant school reports.  This procedure ensures that the needs of a child, moving from a special facility to an integrated setting, are known to the authorities in the ordinary school.</P>

      <P>Where special needs children in integrated situations are concerned, the key funding requirement which might arise would relate to the child's need for special materials or equipment.

      <Quest>if he will cap student registration fees and make a substantial increase in maintenance grants to students in order to alleviate widespread hardship experienced by students in finding accommodation as a result of escalating house prices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>In the context of the free fees initiative, the third level colleges levied a standardised charge of £150 in the 1995-96 academic year for examinations, registration and student services. This charge was fixed at a maximum of £150 for the 1995-96 and 1996-97 academic years.  In the light of the arguments advanced by the universities <Col N="508" /> that the true costs of the services would on average amount to £400 in 1997-98, the need for improved student services and the fact that the charge had been frozen since 1995, I accepted an increase in the charge to £250 for the 1997-98 academic year.  In line with the 4 per cent increase agreed for third level tuition fees for the 1998-99 academic year, I also accepted a similar increase in the level of this charge to £260.  The level of the charge is subject to annual review .</P>
      <P>I would point out that those students who are eligible for maintenance grants under the means tested student support schemes do not have to pay this charge.  In this regard, some 60 per cent of certificate and diploma students in the technological sector and 40 per cent of students in the university sector are eligible for maintenance grants.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to maintenance grants is that the value of the maintenance grant, under the student support schemes, was increased by 1.7 per cent for the 1998-99 academic year.  This increase is in line with the practice in recent years to increase third level maintenance grants in line with inflation as measured by the change in the consumer price index for the period mid February to mid February each year.  The full maintenance grant for the current academic year has been increased to £1,652 at the non-adjacent rate and £660 at the adjacent rate.</P>
      <P>I am aware that students are experiencing difficulties with accommodation.  These difficulties arise from a number of factors, primarily from the wider problems in housing availability.  The package of measures announced by my colleague the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on housing supply will have an impact in due course.  I do not accept that an across the board increase in maintenance grants, which some 50 per cent of third level students receive, will have any significant impact on the issue without a major impact on the money available to other educational programmes.  I have asked my officials to discuss the problem of student accommodation with the various college authorities and particularly to explore any possible options for increasing the supply of student accommodation.  I will of course consider any policy options identified in these discussions.</P>

      <P>The higher education grant schemes <Col N="509" /> operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992.</P>
      <P>In the case of students under 23 years of age, the Acts provide that grants are payable, <i>inter alia</i>, when the means of the student and the means of the students parents or guardians do not exceed such limits as may be prescribed from time to time.  These provisions require that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not a mature student, i.e. aged 23 or over.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties that these provisions can give rise to in individual cases, such as those outlined by the Deputy.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that an alteration to the provisions would require amending legislation.  I have asked my Department to keep this issue under review.</P>

      <P>Lucan Multi-Denominational School was established in September 1997 with temporary recognition.  The purpose of temporary recognition is to enable the school to demonstrate over a period of time that it has a viable future.  During that period, the onus is on the school management to provide suitable temporary accommodation for the school.  My Department normally grant-aids 50 per cent of any reasonable rental charges accruing under this arrangement.</P>
      <P>The school authorities have applied for permanent recognition for the school and an Inspector's report has now been received and is being evaluated. The school management will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
